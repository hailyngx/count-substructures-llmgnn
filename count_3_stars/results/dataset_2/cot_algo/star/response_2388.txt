Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {1, 11, 14}
Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 7, 11}
Node 2: {4, 6, 10, 14}
Node 3: {1, 7, 11, 12}
Node 4: {2, 5, 9, 10}
Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 8, 14}
Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 14}
Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 11, 12}
Node 8: {5, 12, 13, 14}
Node 9: {4, 11}
Node 10: {2, 4, 13}
Node 11: {1, 3, 7, 9, 10}
Node 12: {3, 7, 8}
Node 13: {8, 10}
Node 14: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the final answer is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (3, 7, 11)>, <1, (5, 7, 11)>, <1, (5, 11, 14)>, <1, (7, 11, 14)>, <1, (3, 5, 11)>, 
<1, (0, 11, 14)>, <1, (4, 5, 11)>, <1, (1, 5, 11)>, <1, (1, 3, 11)>, <1, (1, 7, 11)>, 
<5, (4, 6, 14)>, <5, (1, 6, 14)>, <5, (1, 8, 14)>, <5, (1, 4, 14)>, <6, (7, 14, 2)>, 
<6, (5, 7, 14)>, <6, (5, 2, 14)>, <6, (2, 10, 14)>, <7, (1, 3, 12)>, <7, (1, 11, 12)>, 
<7, (1, 11, 8)>, <7, (1, 11, 3)>, <8, (5, 12, 14)>, <8, (5, 8, 14)>, <8, (5, 14, 0)>, 
<8, (5, 14, 2)>, <11, (1, 7, 9)>, <11, (1, 10, 3)>, <11, (1, 3, 10)>, <11, (1, 10, 7)>, 
<11, (3, 9, 10)>, <11, (5, 10, 14)>, <11, (1, 4, 10)>, <11, (1, 4, 5)>, <11, (1, 4, 2)>, 
<11, (5, 10, 4)>, <14, (2, 5, 6)>, <14, (2, 0, 14)>, <14, (2, 8, 14)>, <14, (2, 5, 0)>, 
<14, (5, 0, 14)>.
