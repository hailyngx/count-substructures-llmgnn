Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 16) (1, 21) (1, 2) (21, 1) (21, 0) (21, 22) (21, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 20) (18, 22) (18, 11) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 10) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 11) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 20) (17, 10) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 0) (28, 9) (28, 11) (28, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 3) (11, 18) (11, 27) (11, 28) (11, 14) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 7) (13, 0) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 7) (29, 16) (25, 24) (14, 11) (14, 3) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 23) (23, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 19) (2, 1) (2, 21) (2, 28) (24, 12) (24, 13) (24, 25) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 13) (16, 9) (16, 26) (16, 13) (16, 29) (19, 10) (19, 20) (19, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 9, 21, 22, 10, 12, 28, 8, 11, 26, 13, 20, 15, 5, 4, 0, 16, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding them up, we get a total of 51 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [51].

The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (6, 16, 28)>
<21, (1, 2, 22)>
<22, (1, 18, 10)>
<22, (18, 10, 20)>
<10, (20, 12, 19)>
<12, (15, 0, 10)>
<28, (9, 11, 2)>
<8, (4, 3, 20)>
<11, (18, 14, 27)>
<26, (9, 13, 16)>
<13, (26, 7, 24)>
<13, (16, 24, 29)>
<20, (6, 8, 19)>
<15, (5, 12, 29)>
<5, (15, 7, 23)>
<16, (9, 26, 29)>
