Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (5, 3) (5, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Since we have 15 nodes in the graph, each node can have at most 14 neighbors. Let's first calculate the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 10}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {8, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 12}
- Node 14: {6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 2, Node 6, Node 8, Node 10, Node 14 each have 7 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 9, Node 12, Node 13 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 1 and Node 5 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = \( 5 \times 35 + 6 \times 4 + 2 \times 1 = 175 + 24 + 2 = 201 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [201].
