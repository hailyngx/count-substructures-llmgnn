This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 26) (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 25) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 19) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 13) (23, 19) (4, 1) (4, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 0) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 28) (14, 24) (9, 16) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 10) (24, 14) (24, 26) (24, 12) (26, 16) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 20) (7, 20) (7, 17) (25, 21) (25, 22) (25, 28) (10, 21) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 29) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 24) (3, 16) (3, 28) (3, 29) (28, 14) (28, 25) (28, 10) (28, 3) (15, 5) (15, 19) (19, 27) (19, 23) (19, 15) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 6) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 18) (20, 26) (20, 7) (18, 5) (18, 17) (6, 2) (6, 29) (13, 11) (13, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {8, 14, 26, 27}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 14, 21}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 17}
- Node 3: {16, 28, 29}
- Node 4: {1, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 15, 18, 26}
- Node 6: {2, 29}
- Node 7: {17, 20}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 10, 22, 26}
- Node 10: {9, 21, 28, 29}
- Node 11: {8, 13, 16}
- Node 12: {24}
- Node 13: {11, 23}
- Node 14: {1, 0, 24, 28}
- Node 15: {5, 19}
- Node 16: {3, 9, 26}
- Node 17: {2, 7, 18}
- Node 18: {5, 17}
- Node 19: {15, 23, 27}
- Node 20: {7, 26}
- Node 21: {1, 10, 25}
- Node 22: {9, 23, 25}
- Node 23: {13, 19, 22}
- Node 24: {14, 26, 12}
- Node 25: {21, 22, 28}
- Node 26: {0, 5, 9, 16, 20, 24}
- Node 27: {0, 19}
- Node 28: {3, 10, 14, 25}
- Node 29: {3, 10, 6}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 8, Node 26, and Node 14 each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 9, Node 21, and Node 28 each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5, Node 16, and Node 24 each form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2, Node 17 each form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 57 \)

Therefore, there are a total of [57] unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (8, 14, 26)>  
<8, (0, 1, 11)>  
<14, (1, 0, 24)>  
<26, (0, 5, 9)>  
<1, (4, 8, 21)>  
<9, (4, 10, 22)>  
<21, (1, 10, 25)>  
<28, (3, 10, 14)>  
<5, (2, 15, 18)>  
<16, (3, 9, 26)>  
<24, (14, 26, 12)>  
<2, (5, 6, 17)>
