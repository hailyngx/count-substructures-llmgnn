Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
