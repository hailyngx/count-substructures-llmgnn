Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6}

Now, identify nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

Calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-star
- Node 1: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) three-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-star
- Node 3: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-star
- Node 4: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-star
- Node 5: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-star
- Node 8: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-star
- Node 9: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) three-star

Summing up the total number of three-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of three-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique three-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>
