Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 0) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 9) (20, 24) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 28) (0, 29) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 19) (4, 23) (4, 1) (8, 28) (8, 19) (8, 21) (3, 21) (3, 26) (11, 13) (11, 15) (6, 29) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 26) (21, 8) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 12) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 24) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 15) (10, 15) (10, 22) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 10) (15, 18) (16, 17) (16, 9) (28, 25) (28, 8) (28, 26) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 10) (22, 17) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 28) (26, 14) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 22) (7, 2) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 1) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 9) (12, 21) (12, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 18) (24, 20) (24, 5) (27, 9) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 13) (9, 20) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 27) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {29, 20, 22, 19}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {29, 22, 7}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {21, 26}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {23, 1}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {23, 24, 12}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {29, 20, 21, 26}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {2, 29, 18, 1}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {28, 19, 21}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {20, 16, 23, 27}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {15, 22}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {13, 15}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {21, 5}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {11, 14, 18}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {26, 13}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {11, 19, 10, 18}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {17, 9}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {25, 22, 16}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {15, 7, 13}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {0, 8, 15}
21. Node 20: Neighbors {25, 0, 6, 24, 9}
22. Node 21: Neighbors {8, 3, 6, 12}
23. Node 23: Neighbors {4, 5, 9}
24. Node 24: Neighbors {20, 5}
25. Node 25: Neighbors {20, 17, 28}
26. Node 26: Neighbors {3, 6, 28, 14}
27. Node 27: Neighbors {9}
28. Node 28: Neighbors {25, 8, 26}
29. Node 29: Neighbors {2, 7, 6, 0}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
3. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
6. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
7. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
8. Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
9. Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
10. Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
11. Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
12. Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
13. Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
14. Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43\)

Therefore, the final answer is [43], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (19, 20, 29)>
<2, (7, 29, 6)>
<6, (20, 21, 29)>
<7, (2, 29, 18)>
<9, (20, 23, 16)>
<15, (11, 18, 19)>
<18, (7, 13, 15)>
<20, (6, 24, 25)>
<21, (12, 6, 8)>
<23, (4, 5, 9)>
<25, (20, 28, 17)>
<26, (3, 14, 6)>
<28, (8, 25, 26)>
<29, (0, 6, 7)>
