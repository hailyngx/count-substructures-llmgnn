Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 7) (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 18) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 22) (9, 6) (9, 15) (0, 27) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 23) (27, 13) (27, 0) (27, 19) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 20) (15, 8) (20, 15) (21, 4) (21, 24) (28, 14) (28, 25) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 12) (17, 22) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 16) (5, 25) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 27) (19, 24) (8, 0) (8, 15) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 16) (12, 1) (12, 4) (25, 0) (25, 28) (25, 17) (25, 5) (10, 26) (10, 14) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 3) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 4) (24, 11) (3, 26) (3, 14) (14, 28) (14, 10) (14, 3) (18, 29) (18, 11) (23, 0) (23, 7) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 4) (7, 22) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 23) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 23, 25, 27}
- Node 1: {12, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {15, 17, 29}
- Node 3: {14, 26}
- Node 4: {12, 16, 21, 24}
- Node 5: {7, 25}
- Node 6: {7, 9, 19, 26}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 22, 23}
- Node 8: {0, 15}
- Node 9: {6, 15, 22}
- Node 10: {14, 26}
- Node 11: {18, 22, 24}
- Node 12: {1, 4}
- Node 13: {22, 27}
- Node 14: {3, 10, 28}
- Node 15: {2, 8, 9, 20}
- Node 16: {1, 4, 17, 29}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 16, 25}
- Node 18: {11, 29}
- Node 19: {6, 24, 27}
- Node 20: {15}
- Node 21: {4, 24}
- Node 22: {7, 9, 11, 13, 17}
- Node 23: {0, 7}
- Node 24: {4, 11, 19, 21}
- Node 25: {0, 5, 17, 28}
- Node 26: {3, 6, 10}
- Node 27: {0, 13, 19}
- Node 28: {14, 25}
- Node 29: {2, 16, 18}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Since the graph has 30 nodes, it means that there are \( \binom{30}{3} = 4060 \) possible 3-stars. Let's calculate the 3-stars that are actually formed in this graph:

- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - <22, (7, 9, 17)>
  - <22, (7, 9, 11)>
  - <22, (7, 17, 11)>
  - <22, (9, 17, 11)>
  - <22, (7, 9, 13)>
  - <22, (7, 9, 22)>
  - <22, (7, 17, 13)>
  - <22, (7, 17, 22)>
  - <22, (9, 17, 13)>
  - <22, (9, 17, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
