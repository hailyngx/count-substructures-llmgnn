Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9 and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 14, 5, and 12.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3, 8, 4, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 2, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 12, and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 13, and 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 11, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 10, 13, and 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 7, and 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7 and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 13, and 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 5, 12, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 13, and 5.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed. For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors.

Calculating for each node:
- Node 1:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2:  \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12:  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13:  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 66 => [66]

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 12>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 12>
- <1, 5, 13>
- <1, 12, 13>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 13>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 5, 13>
- <2, 8, 13>
- <6, 9, 0>
- <6, 9, 10>
- <9, 10, 13>
- <9, 13, 14>
