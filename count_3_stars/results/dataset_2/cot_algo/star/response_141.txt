Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 1, 7, 11, 12
Node 1: 0, 4, 8, 14
Node 2: 3, 5, 9, 10
Node 3: 2, 5, 12
Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 9, 13, 14
Node 5: 2, 3, 4
Node 6: 8, 13
Node 7: 0, 4, 11
Node 8: 1, 6, 10, 13
Node 9: 2, 4, 11, 12, 14
Node 10: 2, 8, 14
Node 11: 0, 7, 9, 12
Node 12: 0, 3, 9, 11, 14
Node 13: 4, 6, 8, 11
Node 14: 1, 4, 9, 10, 12

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 4, 1, 8, 13, 5, 0, 11, 2, 9, 12, 10, 14

Computing the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 78

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [78]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<4, (7, 9, 13)>, 
<4, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (9, 11, 13)>, 
<1, (4, 8, 14)>, 
<8, (1, 6, 13)>, 
<13, (4, 8, 11)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<0, (1, 7, 11)>, 
<11, (9, 12, 14)>.
