Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are:

- Node 0: 6, 9, 3, 8
- Node 1: 9, 4, 3, 8
- Node 2: 9, 4, 8
- Node 3: 7, 1, 0
- Node 4: 9, 7, 1, 2
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5, 7, 8, 0
- Node 7: 6, 9, 4, 3, 5
- Node 8: 6, 1, 2, 5, 0
- Node 9: 4, 2, 1, 7, 0

Now, we find the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have 4 neighbors each.

For these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <0, (6, 9, 3)>, <0, (6, 9, 8)>, <0, (6, 3, 8)>, <0, (9, 3, 8)>
  
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <1, (9, 4, 3)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 3, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 8)>
  
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <4, (9, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>

- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>

- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
    - <7, (6, 9, 4)>, <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (6, 9, 5)>, <7, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (6, 4, 5)>, <7, (6, 3, 5)>, <7, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (9, 4, 5)>, <7, (9, 3, 5)>, <7, (4, 3, 5)>

- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
    - <8, (6, 1, 2)>, <8, (6, 1, 5)>, <8, (6, 1, 0)>, <8, (6, 2, 5)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>, <8, (6, 5, 0)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>, <8, (1, 5, 0)>, <8, (2, 5, 0)>

- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
    - <9, (4, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 3)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 3)>, <9, (2, 7, 3)>, <9, (1, 7, 3)>, <9, (7, 1, 3)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Total number of unique 3-stars found: [42]
