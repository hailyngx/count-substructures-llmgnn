Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 10) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 4) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 4) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 4) (18, 0) (12, 8) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 16, 15, 18, 12
- Node 1: 19, 10, 6
- Node 2: 19, 10, 4
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 16, 17, 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 17, 13, 19, 4
- Node 6: 15, 1, 4
- Node 7: 3, 9
- Node 8: 9, 12
- Node 9: 8, 10, 7
- Node 10: 16, 2, 15, 1, 9
- Node 11: 16, 13
- Node 12: 8, 0
- Node 13: 11, 17, 5, 15
- Node 14: 17
- Node 15: 13, 10, 0, 6
- Node 16: 11, 0, 4, 10
- Node 17: 14, 13, 5, 4
- Node 18: 0
- Node 19: 2, 5, 1

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around them:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28 \), so the final answer is [28].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (16, 5, 6)>
- <4, (16, 5, 2)>
- <4, (16, 5, 17)>
- <4, (16, 5, 6)>
- <4, (16, 2, 5)>
- <4, (16, 2, 17)>
- <4, (16, 2, 5)>
- <4, (16, 17, 5)>
- <4, (16, 17, 2)>
- <4, (16, 17, 5)>
- <5, (17, 13, 19)>
- <5, (17, 13, 15)>
- <5, (17, 13, 11)>
- <5, (17, 13, 15)>
- <10, (16, 15, 0)>
- <10, (16, 15, 1)>
- <10, (16, 15, 6)>
- <10, (16, 15, 1)>
- <10, (2, 15, 1)>
- <10, (2, 15, 6)>
- <10, (2, 15, 1)>
- <10, (2, 15, 6)>
- <10, (15, 13, 5)>
- <10, (15, 13, 17)>
- <10, (15, 13, 11)>
- <10, (15, 13, 17)>
- <13, (17, 15, 10)>
- <13, (17, 15, 10)>
- <13, (17, 5, 19)>
- <13, (17, 5, 19)>
