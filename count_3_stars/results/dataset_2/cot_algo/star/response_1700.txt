Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {14}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {1, 4}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 4, 5, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 9, 10}

There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, and 10. We can apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

The total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is the sum of the above calculations: \( 10 + 35 + 20 = 65 \).

Therefore, the final answer, putting 65 inside brackets, is [65]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 13)>
<10, (2, 13, 14)>
<10, (4, 6, 13)>
<10, (4, 13, 14)>
<10, (6, 13, 14)>
