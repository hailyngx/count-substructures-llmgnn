Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 4) (18, 0) (22, 26) (22, 15) (22, 7) (7, 22) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 27) (12, 8) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 25) (29, 5) (29, 23) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 24) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 2) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 17) (11, 7) (11, 14) (23, 29) (23, 21) (23, 1) (23, 3) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 19) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 15) (25, 28) (25, 27) (25, 17) (27, 9) (27, 7) (27, 25) (27, 8) (17, 5) (17, 26) (17, 25) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 24) (2, 21) (2, 19) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 19) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 12) (8, 28) (8, 27) (1, 23) (1, 13) (20, 26) (20, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 10) (10, 20) (10, 19) (15, 5) (15, 22) (15, 16) (13, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are as follows:
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Based on the given information, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 3, 18, 19, 16}
- Node 1: {23, 13}
- Node 2: {21, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 14, 23}
- Node 4: {6, 21, 24}
- Node 5: {9, 29, 17, 15, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 28, 21, 4}
- Node 7: {22, 3, 11, 27}
- Node 8: {12, 28, 27}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 27}
- Node 10: {20, 19}
- Node 11: {7, 14}
- Node 12: {8}
- Node 13: {1}
- Node 14: {11, 24, 3}
- Node 15: {5, 22, 16}
- Node 16: {26, 15, 0}
- Node 17: {5, 26, 25}
- Node 18: {0}
- Node 19: {2, 0, 24, 10, 20}
- Node 20: {26, 10}
- Node 21: {28, 4, 6, 23, 2}
- Node 22: {26, 15, 7}
- Node 23: {29, 21, 1, 3}
- Node 24: {4, 19, 14}
- Node 25: {28, 27, 17}
- Node 26: {22, 20, 16, 17}
- Node 27: {9, 7, 25, 8}
- Node 28: {6, 8, 25}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 29, 17)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 6, 27)>
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <21, (28, 4, 6)>
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <26, (22, 20, 16)>
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 3, 18)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <3, (23, 7, 14)>
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <19, (2, 24, 10)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <15, (5, 22, 16)>
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <17, (5, 26, 25)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <7, (22, 11, 27)>
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <28, (6, 8, 25)>
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, so it forms a 3-star: <14, (11, 24, 3)>
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form a 3-star.

Counting up the total number of 3-stars, we find that there are 13 unique 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final number to put inside brackets is [13].
