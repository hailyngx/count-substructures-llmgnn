Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For node 0, the neighbors are {10, 21, 29}. Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {10, 21, 29}.  
2. For node 1, the neighbors are {13, 14}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
3. For node 2, the neighbors are {7, 16, 18}. Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {7, 16, 18}.
4. For node 3, the neighbors are {6, 8, 13, 15}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {8, 13, 15}.
5. For node 4, the neighbors are {11, 12}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
6. For node 5, the neighbors are {9, 17, 19, 29}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {17, 19, 29}.
7. For node 6, the neighbors are {3, 10}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
8. For node 7, the neighbors are {2, 10, 23, 28}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {10, 23, 28}.
9. For node 8, the neighbors are {3, 17, 19, 25}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {17, 19, 25}.
10. For node 9, the neighbors are {5, 15}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
11. For node 10, the neighbors are {0, 6, 7, 23}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {0, 7, 23}.
12. For node 11, the neighbors are {4, 26}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

18. For node 17, the neighbors are {5, 8, 15, 24}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {8, 15, 24}.
19. For node 18, the neighbors are {2, 16, 29}. Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {16, 29, 2}.
20. For node 19, the neighbors are {5, 8, 13, 20}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {8, 13, 20}.
21. For node 20, the neighbors are {19, 22}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
22. For node 21, the neighbors are {0, 12, 22}. Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {12, 22, 0}.
23. For node 22, the neighbors are {20, 21}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

25. For node 24, the neighbors are {17, 23, 25}. Since it has 3 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {17, 25, 23}.
26. For node 25, the neighbors are {8, 13, 24, 28, 29}. Since it has 5 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {8, 13, 24}.
27. For node 27, the neighbors are {13, 26}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
28. For node 28, the neighbors are {7, 25}. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
29. For node 29, the neighbors are {0, 5, 18, 25}. Since it has 4 neighbors, it forms a 3-star with itself as the center and neighbors {5, 18, 25}.
