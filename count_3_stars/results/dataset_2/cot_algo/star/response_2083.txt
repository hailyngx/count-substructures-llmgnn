Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:
- Node 0: 6, 9, 3, 5, 2
- Node 1: 8, 7
- Node 2: 6, 4, 7, 8, 0
- Node 3: 9, 0, 4
- Node 4: 3, 2, 5
- Node 5: 6, 4, 7, 8, 0
- Node 6: 5, 2, 8, 0
- Node 7: 9, 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 6, 1, 7, 2, 5
- Node 9: 3, 7, 0

Now we can determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming <0, (6, 5, 9)>, <0, (6, 5, 3)>, <0, (6, 2, 5)>, and <0, (9, 3, 5)>. Therefore, it contributes 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, forming <2, (6, 4, 7)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, and <2, (4, 7, 8)>. Therefore, it contributes 3 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, forming <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, and <5, (4, 7, 8)>. Therefore, it contributes 3 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, forming <7, (9, 1, 2)> and <7, (1, 2, 8)>. Therefore, it contributes 2 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 12. Therefore, the final answer is [12].
