Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 13) (8, 19) (9, 11) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 13) (15, 0) (4, 13) (4, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 15, 19, 13
- Node 1: Neighbors are 2, 18, 13
- Node 2: Neighbors are 18, 1, 6
- Node 3: Neighbors are 14, 16, 5, 12
- Node 4: Neighbors are 13, 6
- Node 5: Neighbors are 11, 18, 3, 13
- Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 16, 4, 13
- Node 7: Neighbors are 14, 10, 11
- Node 8: Neighbor is 19
- Node 9: Neighbor is 11
- Node 10: Neighbors are 11, 12, 7
- Node 11: Neighbors are 10, 7, 19, 9, 5
- Node 12: Neighbors are 10, 3, 13
- Node 13: Neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 12, 6
- Node 14: Neighbors are 17, 3, 7
- Node 15: Neighbor is 0
- Node 16: Neighbors are 17, 3, 6
- Node 17: Neighbors are 14, 16, 19
- Node 18: Neighbors are 2, 5, 1
- Node 19: Neighbors are 17, 11, 0, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Since all nodes 0-19 have less than three neighbors, no 3-stars can be formed with these nodes. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
