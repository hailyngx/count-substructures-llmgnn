Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors - 1, 5
- Node 1: Neighbors - 0, 6
- Node 2: Neighbors - 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: Neighbors - 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: Neighbors - 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: Neighbors - 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors - 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: Neighbors - 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors - 2, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: Neighbors - 4, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 2 forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4 forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 6 forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 58

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
