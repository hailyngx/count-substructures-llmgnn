Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (9, 3) (9, 10) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 12) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {4, 10, 19}
- Node 2: {8, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 9, 17}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 12, 15}
- Node 5: {0, 3}
- Node 6: {6, 7, 13, 17}
- Node 7: {6, 16}
- Node 8: {2, 15, 16}
- Node 9: {3, 10}
- Node 10: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 12: {4, 11, 15}
- Node 13: {6, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {13, 17}
- Node 15: {4, 8, 12}
- Node 16: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 17: {3, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 18: {11}
- Node 19: {1, 2, 13}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Nodes 8, 10, 12, 16, and 19 each contribute 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, represented as [5].
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <8, 2, 16>
- <10, 1, 13>
- <12, 4, 15>
- <16, 2, 7>
- <19, 1, 13>
