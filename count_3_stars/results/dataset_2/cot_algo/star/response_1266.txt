Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 28) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 19) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 2) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 24) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 18) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 14) (28, 5) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 28) (3, 24) (3, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 27) (14, 26) (26, 14) (26, 10) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 20) (4, 28) (4, 3) (4, 16) (16, 4) (16, 8) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 25) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 25) (0, 8) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 3) (24, 2) (6, 17) (6, 25) (17, 7) (17, 6) (8, 16) (8, 0) (1, 22) (1, 20) (20, 5) (20, 19) (20, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 0) (25, 6) (25, 2) (2, 21) (2, 24) (2, 25) 

Response:
Given that the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we need to analyze the neighbor sets for each node and identify the 3-stars formed in the graph. Let's go through this step by step:

1. Calculate the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 15, 25, 8}
- Node 1: {22, 20}
- Node 2: {21, 24, 25}
- Node 3: {24, 4}
- Node 4: {28, 3, 16}
- Node 5: {9, 25, 28, 20}
- Node 6: {17, 25}
- Node 7: {21, 29, 14, 17}
- Node 8: {16, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 29, 15, 19}
- Node 10: {26, 0, 13, 25}
- Node 12: {27, 13, 24, 14, 18}
- Node 13: {12, 10}
- Node 14: {7, 27, 12, 26}
- Node 15: {9, 18, 0}
- Node 16: {4, 8}
- Node 17: {6, 7}
- Node 18: {23, 15, 19, 12}
- Node 19: {9, 18, 20}
- Node 20: {5, 1, 19}
- Node 21: {7, 2}
- Node 22: {23, 27, 1}
- Node 23: {22, 24, 18}
- Node 24: {23, 12, 3, 2}
- Node 25: {5, 0, 10, 6, 2}
- Node 26: {10, 14}
- Node 27: {22, 12, 14}
- Node 28: {5, 4, 29}
- Node 29: {9, 7, 28}

2. Identify nodes with \( \binom{n}{3} \) combinations:
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 12: [10]
- Node 18: [4]
- Node 19: [1]
- Node 25: [10]

3. Total number of 3-stars: 28
4. Unique 3-stars found:
<5, 9, 25, 28>, <7, 21, 17, 29>, <9, 5, 19, 29>, <12, 27, 14, 26>, <12, 13, 18, 27>, <18, 19, 20, 15>, <18, 23, 24, 12>, <19, 9, 20, 18>, <2, 21, 22, 24>, <25, 0, 2, 10>

Therefore, the final answer is [28].
