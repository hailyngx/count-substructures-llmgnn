Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 16) (6, 14) (9, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 19) (19, 12) (19, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 18) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:

- Node 0: {16}
- Node 1: {2, 11, 18, 16}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 1}
- Node 3: {15, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {11, 14, 19}
- Node 5: {8, 12, 10}
- Node 6: {14}
- Node 7: {16, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {5, 2, 14, 11}
- Node 9: {18}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 18}
- Node 11: {8, 1, 14, 13, 4}
- Node 12: {5, 2, 13, 17, 19}
- Node 13: {3, 7, 12, 11}
- Node 14: {6, 8, 11, 4}
- Node 15: {3, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 1, 0, 7}
- Node 17: {7, 12}
- Node 18: {9, 1, 10}
- Node 19: {12, 4}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <1, (2, 11, 18)>, <1, (2, 11, 16)>, <1, (2, 18, 16)>, <1, (11, 18, 16)>

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- <2, (8, 12, 1)>

Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- <3, (15, 10, 13)>

Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- <5, (8, 12, 10)>

Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <8, (5, 2, 14)>, <8, (5, 2, 11)>, <8, (5, 14, 11)>, <8, (2, 14, 11)>

Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- <10, (3, 5, 18)>

Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- <11, (8, 1, 14)>, <11, (8, 1, 13)>, <11, (8, 1, 4)>, <11, (8, 14, 13)>, <11, (8, 14, 4)>,
  <11, (8, 13, 4)>, <11, (1, 14, 13)>, <11, (1, 14, 4)>, <11, (1, 13, 4)>, <11, (14, 13, 4)>

Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- <12, (5, 2, 13)>, <12, (5, 2, 17)>, <12, (5, 2, 19)>, <12, (5, 13, 17)>, <12, (5, 13, 19)>,
  <12, (5, 17, 19)>, <12, (2, 13, 17)>, <12, (2, 13, 19)>, <12, (2, 17, 19)>, <12, (13, 17, 19)>

Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <13, (3, 7, 12)>, <13, (3, 7, 11)>, <13, (3, 12, 11)>, <13, (7, 12, 11)>

Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <14, (8, 6, 11)>, <14, (8, 6, 4)>, <14, (8, 11, 4)>, <14, (6, 11, 4)>

Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <16, (1, 0, 7)>, <16, (1, 0, 15)>, <16, (1, 7, 15)>, <16, (0, 7, 15)>

The total number of 3-stars is [40].
