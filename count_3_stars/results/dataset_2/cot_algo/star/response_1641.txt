Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (17, 5) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 10) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 0) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 18, 12}
- Node 1: {15, 18}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 13}
- Node 3: {9, 13, 19, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {8, 17, 4, 18, 11}
- Node 6: {9, 2}
- Node 7: {8, 17, 10}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 3, 19}
- Node 10: {15, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {15, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {15, 0, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 2, 10, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 10, 0, 12, 11}
- Node 16: {19}
- Node 17: {5, 7}
- Node 18: {1, 5, 0}
- Node 19: {9, 3, 13, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3: <3, (9, 19, 13)>
- Node 5: <5, (8, 18, 17)>, <5, (4, 11, 18)>
- Node 15: <15, (1, 18, 10)>, <15, (0, 11, 12)>
- Node 19: <19, (9, 13, 16)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars formed. Therefore, the final result is [7].
