Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 2) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 5) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (18, 13) (2, 15) (2, 8) (5, 17) (5, 11) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 19) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 9) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 16) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 11, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 12}
- Node 2: {8, 15}
- Node 3: {0, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {6, 12, 19}
- Node 5: {11, 17}
- Node 6: {4, 10, 11, 17}
- Node 7: {12, 16}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 14, 15}
- Node 9: {11, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 17}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 7, 16}
- Node 13: {15, 18, 19}
- Node 14: {3, 8}
- Node 15: {2, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 16: {7, 9, 12}
- Node 17: {0, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 18: {13}
- Node 19: {4, 13}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, 1, 8>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, 11, 0>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, 10, 17>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, 1, 12>
- Node 11 forms 2 3-stars: <11, 3, 0> and <11, 5, 6>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, 1, 4>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, 9, 11>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star: <16, 9, 12>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star: <17, 10, 6>
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star: <19, 4, 13>

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 3-stars in this graph: [10].
