Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 8}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Finally, sum up the total number of 3-stars:

\[ 20 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 70 \]

So, the final answer is [70], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
