Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 16) (6, 19) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 5) (14, 10) (14, 15) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (1, 2) (1, 11) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 16) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 16}
- Node 1: {2, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 17, 18}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {6, 13, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 12, 18, 19}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 16, 19}
- Node 7: {13}
- Node 8: {9, 10, 16}
- Node 9: {8, 13, 17}
- Node 10: {8, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 15}
- Node 12: {5, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {10, 15}
- Node 15: {11, 14}
- Node 16: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 17: {2, 9}
- Node 18: {2, 5}
- Node 19: {4, 5, 6}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 2: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 3: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 5: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = 10
- Node 6: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 8: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 9: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 10: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 11: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 12: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 13: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = 4
- Node 14: [\( \binom{2}{3} \)] (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 15: [\( \binom{2}{3} \)] (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 16: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1
- Node 17: [\( \binom{2}{3} \)] (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 18: [\( \binom{2}{3} \)] (Not enough neighbors)
- Node 19: [\( \binom{3}{3} \)] = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives: 
1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 16)>, <2, (0, 1, 17)>, <3, (5, 6, 13)>, <5, (0, 3, 12)>, <6, (3, 4, 19)>, <8, (9, 10, 16)>, <9, (8, 13, 17)>, <10, (8, 12, 14)>, <11, (1, 3, 15)>, <13, (3, 4, 9)>, <19, (4, 5, 6)>.
