Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 10) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 18) (6, 13) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 19) (5, 17) (1, 18) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 8) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 12, 13, 17
- Node 1: 18
- Node 2: 8, 10, 16
- Node 3: 15
- Node 4: 0, 7, 19
- Node 5: 17
- Node 6: 13
- Node 7: 4, 8, 14
- Node 8: 2, 7, 11, 16, 19
- Node 9: 13, 16, 19
- Node 10: 2, 11, 16
- Node 11: 8, 10, 18
- Node 12: 0, 14
- Node 13: 0, 6, 9, 14
- Node 14: 7, 12, 13, 17
- Node 15: 3, 18, 19
- Node 16: 2, 8, 9, 10
- Node 17: 0, 5, 14, 18
- Node 18: 1, 11, 15, 17
- Node 19: 4, 8, 9, 15

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for them, and count the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
- Node 8: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 4, 12, 17>
- <0, 4, 13, 17>
- <0, 12, 13, 17>
- <0, 13, 14, 17>
- <4, 7, 13, 14>
- <8, 11, 16, 18>
- <8, 16, 17, 18>
- <8, 16, 18, 19>
- <8, 17, 18, 19>
- <13, 14, 17, 18>
- <13, 16, 17, 19>
- <13, 16, 18, 19>
- <14, 16, 17, 18>
- <14, 16, 17, 19>
- <14, 16, 18, 19>
