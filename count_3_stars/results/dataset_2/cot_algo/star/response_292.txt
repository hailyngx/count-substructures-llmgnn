Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 4, 3, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 3, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 8, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 8, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 8, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbor {9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 3, 2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 4, 1, 7, 0}

Next, we will identify the 3-stars:
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 4, 3)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <3, (1, 8, 6)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>
