Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 9, 7, 3
- Node 1: 5, 2, 4
- Node 2: 5, 8, 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 6, 2, 0, 4
- Node 4: 5, 9, 1, 3
- Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 1, 0, 4
- Node 6: 5, 7, 3, 8
- Node 7: 6, 2, 8, 0
- Node 8: 6, 2, 7
- Node 9: 5, 4, 0

Now, let's check for each node if it can form any 3-stars:
- Node 0: It can form 1 unique 3-star <0, (5, 9, 7)>.
- Node 1: It can form 1 unique 3-star <1, (5, 2, 4)>.
- Node 2: It can form 1 unique 3-star <2, (5, 8, 1)>.
- Node 3: It can form 1 unique 3-star <3, (6, 2, 4)>.
- Node 4: It can form 1 unique 3-star <4, (5, 9, 1)>.
- Node 5: It can form 1 unique 3-star <5, (9, 6, 2)>.
- Node 6: It can form 1 unique 3-star <6, (5, 7, 3)>.
- Node 7: It can form 1 unique 3-star <7, (6, 2, 8)>.
- Node 8: It cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 9: It cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph, as calculated above. Thus, the final answer is [8].
