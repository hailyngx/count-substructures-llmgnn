Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 26) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 18) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 14) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 28) (27, 5) (10, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 26) (0, 2) (0, 29) (20, 29) (20, 1) (9, 22) (9, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (5, 27) (5, 25) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 4) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 24) (8, 3) (8, 25) (8, 11) (18, 3) (18, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 15) (26, 4) (16, 2) (16, 21) (16, 6) (21, 13) (21, 22) (21, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (24, 15) (24, 14) (6, 22) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 6) (4, 19) (4, 26) (4, 6) (25, 5) (25, 8) (28, 2) (28, 27) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 29}
- Node 1: {3, 20, 23}
- Node 2: {0, 16, 28, 29}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 18}
- Node 4: {6, 19, 26}
- Node 5: {6, 25, 27}
- Node 6: {4, 6, 14, 16, 22}
- Node 7: {6, 15}
- Node 8: {3, 11, 18, 25}
- Node 9: {17, 22}
- Node 10: {12, 15, 17}
- Node 11: {8, 19}
- Node 12: {10, 14, 27}
- Node 13: {21, 22}
- Node 14: {6, 12, 18, 23, 24}
- Node 15: {7, 10, 24, 26}
- Node 16: {2, 6, 21}
- Node 17: {9, 10, 26}
- Node 18: {3, 8, 14}
- Node 19: {4, 11, 29}
- Node 20: {1, 29}
- Node 21: {2, 13, 16, 22}
- Node 22: {6, 9, 13, 21, 23}
- Node 23: {1, 13, 14, 22}
- Node 24: {14, 15}
- Node 25: {5, 8}
- Node 26: {4, 15, 17, 29}
- Node 27: {5, 12, 28}
- Node 28: {2, 27}
- Node 29: {0, 19, 20, 26}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (0, 16, 28)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (4, 14, 16)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (6, 18, 24)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, (10, 24, 26)>
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star: <22, (6, 13, 23)>
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star: <29, (0, 19, 26)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
