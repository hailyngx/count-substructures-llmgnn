Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (14, 0) (14, 19) (17, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 12) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (3, 6) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 2) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 15) (7, 8) (7, 11) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 2) (1, 9) (1, 16) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 18, 12}
- Node 1: {9, 16}
- Node 2: {11, 6, 15, 10}
- Node 3: {6, 18}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 13, 12}
- Node 5: {19, 4, 10}
- Node 6: {13, 3, 2}
- Node 7: {8, 11}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 11, 7}
- Node 9: {11, 1, 19}
- Node 10: {8, 5, 13, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 8, 7, 2}
- Node 12: {4, 0, 19, 15}
- Node 13: {17, 4, 10, 6}
- Node 14: {0, 19}
- Node 15: {12, 18, 2}
- Node 16: {1}
- Node 17: {13}
- Node 18: {0, 3, 15}
- Node 19: {5, 9, 14, 12}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 8, 13}, resulting in <4, (5, 8, 13)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 8, 13}, resulting in <10, (5, 8, 13)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 8, 2}, resulting in <11, (7, 8, 2)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes {19, 0, 15}, resulting in <12, (19, 0, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so it should be represented as [4].
