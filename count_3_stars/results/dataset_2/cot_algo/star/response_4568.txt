Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (5, 19) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 16) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 0) (16, 15) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 13) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 13) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to find the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: (4, 12, 13)
2. Node 1: (2, 4, 10, 17)
3. Node 2: (1, 8, 14)
4. Node 3: (7, 14, 19)
5. Node 4: (0, 1, 5, 6)
6. Node 5: (4, 19)
7. Node 6: (4, 7, 11)
8. Node 7: (3, 6)
9. Node 8: (2, 12, 15)
10. Node 10: (1, 14, 17)
11. Node 11: (6, 13, 17)
12. Node 12: (0, 8)
13. Node 13: (0, 11, 14, 16)
14. Node 14: (2, 3, 10, 13, 18)
15. Node 15: (8, 16)
16. Node 16: (13, 15, 18, 19)
17. Node 17: (1, 10, 11, 18)
18. Node 18: (14, 16, 17)
19. Node 19: (3, 5, 16)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<1, (2, 4, 10)>, <1, (2, 4, 17)>, <1, (2, 10, 17)>, <1, (4, 10, 17)>

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars:
<4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 19)>, <4, (1, 6, 19)>, <4, (5, 6, 19)>

Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars:
<13, (0, 11, 14)>, <13, (0, 11, 16)>, <13, (0, 14, 16)>, <13, (11, 14, 16)>

Summing up the 3-stars from the nodes above: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, so the final count is [12].
