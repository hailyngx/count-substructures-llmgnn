Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For node 5: Neighbors {9, 13, 3, 10, 7, 14}, 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
2. For node 9: Neighbors {12, 5}, node 9 has less than 3 neighbors
3. For node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 12, 4, 13}, 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
4. For node 10: Neighbors {5, 0, 7, 1, 14}, 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
5. For node 11: Neighbors {13, 4}, node 11 has less than 3 neighbors
6. For node 4: Neighbors {6, 11, 8, 12, 14, 2}, 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars
7. For node 8: Neighbors {4, 12, 3, 1, 7}, 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
8. For node 0: Neighbors {10, 13}, node 0 has less than 3 neighbors
9. For node 14: Neighbors {5, 10, 4}, node 14 has less than 3 neighbors
10. For node 13: Neighbors {5, 6, 11, 0}, 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
11. For node 7: Neighbors {5, 10, 8, 2}, 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
12. For node 12: Neighbors {9, 6, 4, 8, 3}, 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
13. For node 1: Neighbors {6, 10, 8}, node 1 has less than 3 neighbors
14. For node 3: Neighbors {5, 8, 12, 2}, 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
15. For node 2: Neighbors {6, 4, 7, 3}, 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [96].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 13, 3)>, <5, (9, 13, 10)>, <5, (9, 13, 7)>, <5, (9, 13, 14)>, <5, (13, 10, 7)>, <5, (13, 10, 14)>, <5, (3, 8, 12)>, <5, (3, 8, 2)>, <5, (3, 12, 2)>, <5, (8, 12, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 12)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 13)>, <6, (1, 12, 4)>, <6, (1, 12, 13)>, <6, (1, 4, 13)>, <6, (2, 4, 13)>, <6, (2, 12, 13)>, <6, (4, 12, 13)>, <10, (5, 0, 7)>, <10, (5, 0, 14)>, <10, (5, 7, 14)>, <10, (0, 7, 14)>, <4, (6, 11, 8)>, <4, (6, 11, 12)>, <4, (6, 8, 12)>, <4, (11, 8, 12)>, <4, (8, 12, 3)>, <8, (4, 12, 3)>, <12, (9, 6, 4)>, <12, (9, 6, 8)>, <12, (9, 6, 3)>, <12, (9, 4, 8)>, <12, (9, 4, 3)>, <12, (6, 4, 8)>, <12, (6, 4, 3)>, <12, (6, 8, 3)>, <12, (4, 8, 3)>, <13, (5, 6, 11)>, <13, (5, 6, 0)>, <13, (5, 6, 12)>
