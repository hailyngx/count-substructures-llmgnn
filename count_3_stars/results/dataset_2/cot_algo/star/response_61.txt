Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 11) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges by node for easier reference:

Node 0: {1, 10, 13, 14}
Node 1: {0, 2, 14}
Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 10}
Node 3: {2, 9, 12}
Node 4: {2, 5, 10, 14}
Node 5: {2, 4, 12, 13}
Node 6: {8, 11, 13}
Node 7: {8, 11, 13, 14}
Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
Node 9: {3, 8, 11, 13}
Node 10: {0, 2, 4, 12}
Node 11: {6, 7, 9, 13, 12}
Node 12: {3, 5, 10, 11}
Node 13: {0, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11}
Node 14: {0, 4, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 6 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing these up: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42

So, there are 42 unique 3-stars in this graph. Thus, the final answer is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 13>
<0, 1, 14>
<0, 10, 13>
<0, 10, 14>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 4, 10>
<2, 4, 12>
<2, 5, 12>
<4, 5, 10>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 6, 13>
<5, 7, 13>
<6, 7, 13>
<9, 11, 13>
<11, 12, 13>
