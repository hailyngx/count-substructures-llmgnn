Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 10) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 8, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 13, 14, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 8, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) for these nodes:
- Node 0: 1 combination
- Node 1: 1 combination
- Node 2: 1 combination
- Node 3: 1 combination
- Node 4: 1 combination
- Node 5: 1 combination
- Node 6: 1 combination
- Node 8: 1 combination
- Node 10: 4 combinations
- Node 11: 1 combination
- Node 12: 2 combinations
- Node 13: 1 combination
- Node 14: 1 combination

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 15
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 14>
<1, 13, 6>
<2, 4, 12>
<3, 5, 10>
<4, 2, 12>
<5, 3, 13>
<6, 1, 7>
<8, 0, 12>
<10, 3, 13>
<10, 4, 12>
<10, 6, 13>
<10, 9, 11>
<11, 2, 5>
<12, 2, 4>
<12, 8, 0>
