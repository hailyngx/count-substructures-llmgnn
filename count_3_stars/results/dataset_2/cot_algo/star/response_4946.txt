Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (1, 19) (1, 18) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (15, 16) (15, 10) (16, 6) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 13) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 11) (14, 18) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 3) (3, 8) (3, 19) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by first finding the neighbors of each node, and then applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Here is the list of 3-stars found in this graph:

\[ <0, (8, 16, 13)>, <1, (7, 18, 19)>, <2, (8, 19, 5)>, <3, (7, 8, 19)>, <4, (5, 9, 10)>, <5, (4, 8, 12)>, <6, (14, 16, 17)>, <7, (1, 3, 10)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <10, (4, 7, 15)>, <13, (0, 16, 17)>, <14, (6, 11, 18)>, <15, (10, 16, 0)>, <16, (6, 8, 15)>, <17, (6, 13, 14)>, <18, (1, 12, 14)>, <19, (1, 2, 3)> \]

As we go through the list of nodes, we see that all nodes with 3 or more neighbors form 3-stars. 

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
