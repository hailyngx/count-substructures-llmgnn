Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 8, 9} <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 2, 5} <3, (1, 2, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 3, 5} <6, (0, 3, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
