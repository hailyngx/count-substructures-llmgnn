Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 9) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 12) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (6, 12) (7, 13) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 6) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 1) (8, 5) (8, 18) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph:

```
   11----16----14----1
    |\        |    | |
    | 12      4    | |
    |  |     /|    | |
    |  3---15  |    5 |
    |  |\  |   13   |
    |  |  9 /  /|   |
    |  | / |/ / |   |
    |  0--19 8  17  |
     \ |   |  \ | /
      \\   |   \\  
        2  18   7  
           |         
           10        
           |         
           6       
```

Now, let's identify the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 15, 19} (Degree 3)
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 14} (Degree 2)
- Node 2: Neighbors {10, 12, 18} (Degree 3)
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 12, 15} (Degree 4)
- Node 4: Neighbors {11, 13, 16, 17} (Degree 4)
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8, 19} (Degree 5)
- Node 6: Neighbor {12} (Degree 1)
- Node 7: Neighbor {13} (Degree 1)
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 18} (Degree 2)
- Node 9: Neighbors {10, 15} (Degree 2)
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 9, 18} (Degree 3)
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 12, 16} (Degree 3)
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 11, 19} (Degree 5)
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 7, 14, 17} (Degree 4)
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 13, 16} (Degree 3)
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 9} (Degree 2)
- Node 16: Neighbors {4, 11, 14} (Degree 3)
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 13, 19} (Degree 3)
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 8, 10} (Degree 3)
- Node 19: Neighbors {0, 5, 12, 17} (Degree 4)

We can now count the number of 3-stars in this graph by calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with degree 3 or more:

- Node 0, Node 5, Node 12, and Node 19 each form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 and Node 10 each form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 8 \).

In the end, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (3, 15, 19)>
- <2, (10, 18, 12)>
- <5, (0, 1, 8)>
- <12, (2, 6, 19)>
- <19, (0, 5, 17)>
