Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (15, 12) (15, 17) (19, 2) (19, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 19) (1, 18) (14, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (16, 4) (16, 18) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 5, 18}
Node 1: {18}
Node 2: {0, 11, 19}
Node 3: {0, 7, 17}
Node 4: {6, 16, 17}
Node 5: {0, 9, 14}
Node 6: {4, 10, 17}
Node 7: {3, 9, 12, 13}
Node 8: {9, 10}
Node 9: {5, 8, 11, 7}
Node 10: {6, 8, 19}
Node 11: {9, 2, 12, 18}
Node 12: {7, 11, 13, 15}
Node 13: {7, 12, 18}
Node 14: {5}
Node 15: {12, 17}
Node 16: {4, 18}
Node 17: {3, 4, 6, 15}
Node 18: {0, 1, 11, 13, 16}
Node 19: {2, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 11: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 2, 11>
<0, 2, 18>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 18>
<0, 5, 9>
<0, 11, 9>
<0, 18, 11>
<1, 18, 13>
<2, 11, 18>
<4, 6, 17>
<7, 9, 11>
<7, 9, 12>
<7, 9, 13>
<7, 12, 15>
<9, 11, 12>
<12, 13, 18>
<15, 17, 4>
<16, 18, 4>
