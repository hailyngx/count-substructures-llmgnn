Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {4, 8, 5, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {7, 3, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 0}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 6, 9, 5}
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 8, 0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 0}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 7, 3, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 6, 5, 1}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 9, 0}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 54. So, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 8, 5)>
- <1, (7, 3, 2)>
- <1, (7, 5, 9)>
- <1, (7, 3, 5)>
- <1, (3, 9, 5)>
- <4, (7, 5, 6)>
- <4, (8, 0, 5)>
- <4, (7, 6, 3)>
- <4, (6, 5, 7)>
- <5, (7, 3, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <5, (1, 7, 6)>
- <5, (3, 0, 6)>
- <5, (1, 0, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 0)>
- <8, (4, 0, 8)>
- <9, (1, 3, 8)>
