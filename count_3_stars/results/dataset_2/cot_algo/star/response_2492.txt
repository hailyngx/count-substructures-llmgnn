Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 21) (9, 20) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 14) (21, 9) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 12) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 22) (26, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 27) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 13) (27, 6) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 20) (15, 28) (15, 22) (15, 24) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 7) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 27) (23, 18) (0, 17) (2, 9) (2, 10) (12, 21) (12, 6) (12, 8) (29, 1) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (14, 1) (14, 27) (14, 20) (22, 25) (22, 15) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 14) (18, 13) (18, 23) (19, 3) (19, 13) (24, 15) (24, 17) 

Response:
Given that this graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node. 

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {17}
Node 1: {20, 21, 14, 29}
Node 2: {9, 10}
Node 3: {25, 7, 11, 17, 19}
Node 4: {9, 27, 13}
Node 5: {9, 6, 10}
Node 6: {5, 11, 12, 27}
Node 7: {3, 17, 8}
Node 8: {11, 12, 7}
Node 9: {5, 4, 2, 21, 20}
Node 10: {5, 2, 20}
Node 11: {3, 8, 6, 23, 26}
Node 12: {21, 6, 8}
Node 13: {4, 19, 18}
Node 14: {1, 27, 20}
Node 15: {28, 22, 24}
Node 16: {21, 28}
Node 17: {3, 0, 24, 7}
Node 18: {13, 23}
Node 19: {3, 13}
Node 20: {1, 10, 14, 9}
Node 21: {9, 1, 16, 12}
Node 22: {25, 15}
Node 23: {25, 11, 27, 18}
Node 24: {15, 17}
Node 25: {3, 23, 22}
Node 26: {11}
Node 27: {6, 4, 14, 23}
Node 28: {16, 15}
Node 29: {1}

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28, 29

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

Each of the nodes with 3 neighbors can potentially form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:
<1, 20, 14>
<2, 10, 9>
<5, 6, 11>
<6, 12, 21>
<7, 8, 11>
<10, 20, 9>
<13, 18, 23>
<15, 22, 24>
<16, 21, 28>
<19, 13, 3>
<22, 15, 25>
<24, 17, 7>
<26, 11, 3>
<28, 16, 21>
<29, 1, 21>
