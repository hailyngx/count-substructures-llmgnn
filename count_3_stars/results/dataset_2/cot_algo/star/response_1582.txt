Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {4, 6, 9, 5, 2}
2: {7, 1, 3, 0, 5}
3: {4, 7, 6, 0, 2}
4: {7, 3, 1}
5: {8, 1}
6: {1, 3, 8, 0}
7: {4, 3, 9, 2, 8}
8: {7, 6, 9, 5, 0}
9: {7, 8, 1}
0: {6, 8, 3, 2}

Now, we will go through each node to determine the 3-stars formed:

Node 1: Since node 1 has 5 neighbors, it can form \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars. 
Node 2: Node 2 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 3: Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 4: Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
Node 5: Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 6: Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 7: Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 8: Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
Node 9: Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms only 1 3-star.
Node 0: Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 51. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
