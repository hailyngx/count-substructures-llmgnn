Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {9}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Based on the neighbors, the 3-stars formed are:
- Node 9: <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
