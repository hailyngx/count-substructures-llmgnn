Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 9) (20, 22) (20, 10) (25, 27) (25, 13) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 21) (5, 27) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 16) (0, 14) (0, 26) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 12) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 15) (29, 19) (29, 13) (2, 3) (2, 24) (2, 15) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 1) (24, 17) (24, 2) (26, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) (10, 20) (10, 3) (10, 23) (10, 28) (21, 5) (21, 27) (21, 9) (27, 25) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 21) (27, 19) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 28) (22, 20) (22, 4) (22, 7) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 28) (19, 29) (19, 27) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 10) (7, 6) (7, 22) (7, 18) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 28) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 16) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 18) (28, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 18) (16, 6) (16, 8) (16, 3) 

Response:
