Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (6, 15) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (10, 7) (0, 17) (0, 5) (9, 19) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 17}
- Node 1: {13, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 11, 14, 17, 18}
- Node 3: {4, 12, 15, 19}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 11, 16, 18}
- Node 5: {0, 11}
- Node 6: {15}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 10, 18}
- Node 8: {15, 18}
- Node 9: {12, 19}
- Node 10: {7}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 12: {3, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 16}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 12}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 8, 17, 19}
- Node 16: {4, 13}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 15}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 19: {3, 9, 12, 15}

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Total 3-stars: inom{20}{3} = 1140

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1140].

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (4, 12, 19)>
<4, (2, 3, 18)>
<15, (3, 8, 19)>
