10. Node 12:
    - Neighbors: 7, 10
    - 3-stars: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 12.

11. Node 4:
    - Neighbors: 18
    - 3-stars: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 4.

12. Node 5:

    - 3-stars: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 19.

16. Node 8:
    - Neighbors: 1, 17
    - 3-stars: No 3-stars can be formed with Node 8.

17. Node 10:
    - Neighbors: 2, 12
