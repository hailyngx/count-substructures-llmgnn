Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can represent the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
6. Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
8. Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
9. Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars, we get a total of 70 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 0, 5>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <5, 7, 8>
- <7, 8, 9>
