Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 17) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 2) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 17) (10, 13) (10, 3) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 19) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {16, 17, 11}
- Node 1: {16, 9}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 2, 10, 19}
- Node 4: {7, 5, 3}
- Node 5: {4, 18, 11}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 19}
- Node 8: {13, 2, 9, 18}
- Node 9: {8, 1, 17}
- Node 10: {13, 3}
- Node 11: {7, 18, 0, 5}
- Node 12: {13, 2, 16, 17}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 10}
- Node 14: {15, 19}
- Node 15: {14, 19}
- Node 16: {1, 0, 12}
- Node 17: {9, 0, 12}
- Node 18: {8, 5, 11}
- Node 19: {7, 15, 14, 3}

Next, we'll identify nodes with three or more neighbors to determine the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19 (13 nodes)

Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19 (9 nodes)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[
\text{{Total 3-stars}} = \binom{9}{3} + \binom{13}{3} = 84 + 286 = 370
\]

So, the final answer is [370].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 16, 17>
- <0, 16, 12>
- <0, 17, 12>
- <3, 4, 2>
- <3, 4, 19>
- <3, 2, 10>
- <4, 7, 11>
- <4, 5, 11>
- <5, 18, 11>
- <9, 8, 1>
- <9, 8, 17>
- <9, 1, 16>
- <10, 13, 3>
- <14, 15, 19>
- <17, 9, 0>
- <17, 12, 16>
- <18, 8, 11>
- <19, 7, 15>
