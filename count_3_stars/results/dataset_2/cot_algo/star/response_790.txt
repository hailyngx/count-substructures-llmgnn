Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 19) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (0, 10) (16, 4) (16, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {10}
- Node 1: {3, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 11, 12, 16}
- Node 4: {7, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 5: {9, 14, 15}
- Node 6: {7, 11, 17}
- Node 7: {4, 6}
- Node 8: {9, 19}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 10, 18}
- Node 10: {0, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 13: {4, 10, 18}
- Node 14: {5, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 15: {4, 5, 14}
- Node 16: {3, 4}
- Node 17: {2, 6, 19}
- Node 18: {2, 9, 13}
- Node 19: {8, 14, 17}

Next, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 14, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 19

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we have \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31 \).

Therefore, the final answer, represented inside brackets, is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (3, 12, 17)>
- <3, (1, 2, 11)>
- <4, (7, 13, 15)>
- <5, (9, 14, 15)>
- <6, (7, 11, 17)>
- <9, (5, 8, 18)>
- <14, (5, 11, 15)>
- <17, (2, 6, 19)>
- <18, (2, 9, 13)>
- <19, (8, 14, 17)>
