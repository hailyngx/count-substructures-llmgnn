Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 5) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 11) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 1) (7, 6) (7, 17) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: 8, 14, 13
- Node 1: 17, 4, 16, 5
- Node 2: 9, 14
- Node 3: 17, 14
- Node 4: 18, 19, 5, 1
- Node 5: 4, 14, 1
- Node 6: 7, 13
- Node 7: 6, 17
- Node 8: 0, 18
- Node 9: 15, 2, 16
- Node 10: 15, 11, 13, 18
- Node 11: 15, 10, 13, 12
- Node 12: 11, 19
- Node 13: 6, 10, 11, 0
- Node 14: 3, 2, 0, 5
- Node 15: 9, 10, 11, 16
- Node 16: 15, 9, 1
- Node 17: 3, 1, 7
- Node 18: 10, 8, 4
- Node 19: 4, 12

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors or more: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16

Calculating \( \text{inom} {n}{3} \) for these nodes:

- Node 0: 3C3 = 1
- Node 1: 4C3 = 4
- Node 4: 4C3 = 4
- Node 5: 3C3 = 1
- Node 9: 3C3 = 1
- Node 10: 4C3 = 4
- Node 11: 4C3 = 4
- Node 13: 4C3 = 4
- Node 14: 4C3 = 4
- Node 15: 4C3 = 4
- Node 16: 3C3 = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 13, 14)>
<1, (17, 4, 16)>
<4, (18, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 14, 1)>
<9, (15, 2, 16)>
<10, (15, 11, 13)>
<11, (15, 10, 13)>
<13, (10, 11, 0)>
<14, (3, 2, 0)>
<15, (9, 10, 11)>
<16, (15, 9, 1)>
