Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 16) (0, 13) (0, 4) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 19) (18, 5) (18, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of [8] 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (15, 6, 9)>
<17, (14, 10, 6)>
<(10, 16, 19), 3> 
<8, (6, 13, 4)>
<4, (8, 12, 0)>
<13, (9, 1, 0)>
<1, (14, 13, 19)>
<5, (10, 11, 18)>
