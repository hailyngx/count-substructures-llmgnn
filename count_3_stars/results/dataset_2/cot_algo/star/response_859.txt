Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 21) (3, 1) (15, 1) (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 18) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 23) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 24) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 16) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 0) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 25) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 19) (17, 26) (0, 29) (0, 10) (0, 20) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 6) (20, 28) (28, 29) (28, 20) (28, 12) (25, 16) (25, 10) (25, 17) (25, 18) (27, 19) (27, 8) (26, 22) (26, 11) (26, 29) (26, 17) (9, 22) (9, 8) (8, 27) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 5) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 18) (23, 13) (23, 4) (6, 20) (14, 2) (12, 28) (12, 8) (21, 22) (21, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 25) (18, 5) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {10, 20, 29}
Node 1: {3, 7, 15, 17}
Node 2: {14, 20}
Node 3: {1}
Node 4: {7, 11, 23}
Node 5: {8, 18, 24}
Node 6: {20}
Node 7: {1, 4, 24}
Node 8: {5, 8, 12, 21, 27}
Node 9: {8, 22}
Node 10: {0, 18, 19, 25}
Node 11: {4, 16, 24, 26}
Node 12: {8, 28}
Node 13: {18, 22, 23}
Node 14: {2}
Node 15: {1}
Node 16: {11, 18, 25, 29}
Node 17: {1, 17, 19, 25, 26}
Node 18: {5, 10, 13, 16, 25}
Node 19: {10, 17, 27}
Node 20: {0, 2, 6, 28}
Node 21: {8, 22}
Node 22: {9, 13, 21, 26}
Node 23: {4, 13}
Node 24: {5, 7, 11}
Node 25: {10, 16, 17, 18}
Node 26: {11, 17, 22, 29}
Node 27: {8, 19}
Node 28: {12, 20, 29}
Node 29: {0, 16, 26, 28}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 8, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 25, 26, 29

Number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{16}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{20}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{25}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{29}{3} = 10 + 56 + 120 + 165 + 560 + 680 + 816 + 1140 + 1540 + 2300 + 2600 + 3654 = 13141 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13141].

In the unique 3-stars form:
<5, (8, 10, 29)>, <8, (5, 21, 27)>, <10, (18, 25, 29)>, <11, (16, 24, 26)>, <16, (18, 25, 29)>, <17, (25, 26, 29)>, <18, (5, 16, 25)>, <20, (0, 28, 29)>, <22, (13, 21, 26)>, <25, (16, 17, 18)>, <26, (17, 22, 29)>
