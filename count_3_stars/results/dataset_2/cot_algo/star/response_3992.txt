Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) 

Response:
There are 12 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and therefore have the potential to form 3-stars. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 10, 4, 7, 14, 3. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
2. Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 9, 8, 14, 13. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 9, 14, 3, 13. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 12, 0, 13, 2. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
5. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 9, 10, 8, 0, 14. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
6. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 9, 8, 7. Number of 3-stars: 1
7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 12, 14, 13. Number of 3-stars: 1
8. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 10, 4. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
9. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 5, 8, 4, 2, 1. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
10. Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 11, 0, 8, 4, 13. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
11. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 14, 6, 3. Number of 3-stars: 1
12. Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 9, 10, 3, 6, 1. Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (10, 4, 14)>, <1, (9, 8, 14)>, <2, (9, 14, 3)>, <3, (12, 0, 13)>, <4, (9, 10, 8)>, <6, (12, 14, 13)>, <8, (5, 9, 10)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <10, (11, 0, 8)>, <12, (14, 6, 3)>, <13, (9, 10, 3)>, <14, (4, 0, 3)>
