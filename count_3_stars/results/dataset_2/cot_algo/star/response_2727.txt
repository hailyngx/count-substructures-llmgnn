Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node. 
Here is the list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 14, 7, 11, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 14, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 1, 0, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 13, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 13, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 14, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 14, 10, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 5}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {7, 12}
- Node 11: {9, 4, 6, 0}
- Node 12: {9, 1, 10}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 0, 7, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars.

- Nodes forming 3-stars: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9, 14

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \), where \( n \) is the number of neighbors of the node.

- Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 14: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
- <0, (9, 14, 7)>
- <1, (3, 2, 4)>
- <4, (1, 3, 11)>
- <6, (5, 8, 14)>
- <9, (5, 11, 12)>
- <14, (1, 7, 13)>
