Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 23) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 25) (15, 24) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 20) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 27) (2, 3) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 9) (29, 17) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 18) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 22) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 1) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 26) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 21) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 20) (6, 12) (6, 20) (6, 13) (28, 9) (28, 23) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 21) (13, 6) (13, 5) (1, 17) (1, 27) (1, 0) (18, 29) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 25) (16, 8) (16, 0) (22, 12) (9, 17) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 15) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 9) (21, 19) (21, 5) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 5) (20, 10) (20, 26) (20, 6) (23, 3) (23, 28) 

Response:
Following the instructions, we can first calculate the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 16, 25}
- Node 1: {0, 17, 27}
- Node 2: {3, 9, 19, 29}
- Node 3: {2, 15, 23}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {12, 13, 21, 24}
- Node 6: {12, 13, 20}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 24}
- Node 8: {7, 16, 26}
- Node 9: {2, 11, 17, 25, 28}
- Node 10: {11, 20, 27}
- Node 11: {9, 10, 15, 27}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 22, 27}
- Node 13: {5, 6}
- Node 14: {17, 25}
- Node 15: {3, 11, 24, 25}
- Node 16: {0, 8}
- Node 17: {1, 9, 14, 29}
- Node 18: {29}
- Node 19: {2, 21, 26, 29}
- Node 20: {6, 10, 26}
- Node 21: {5, 19}
- Node 22: {12}
- Node 23: {3, 28}
- Node 24: {5, 7, 15}
- Node 25: {0, 9, 14, 15}
- Node 26: {8, 19, 20}
- Node 27: {1, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 28: {9, 23}
- Node 29: {2, 17, 18, 19}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 43

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [43]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (9, 19, 29)>, <9, (2, 17, 25)>, <11, (9, 15, 27)>, <15, (3, 24, 25)>, <17, (1, 9, 29)>, <19, (2, 21, 26)>, <24, (5, 7, 15)>.
