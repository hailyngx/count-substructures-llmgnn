Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, we will identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 9}
Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7, 14}
Node 2: {0, 10, 11, 13}
Node 3: {0, 1, 7, 10, 11, 14}
Node 4: {1, 10, 12, 14}
Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 8, 13}
Node 6: {5, 7, 9, 10, 12}
Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}
Node 8: {5, 7, 9}
Node 9: {0, 6, 8, 14}
Node 10: {2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 11: {2, 3, 12}
Node 12: {4, 6, 11}
Node 13: {2, 5}
Node 14: {1, 3, 4, 9}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars. Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 11>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 9, 14>, <1, 3, 14>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 4, 10>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 5>, <3, 7, 14>, <3, 11, 12>, <4, 10, 12>, <5, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>
