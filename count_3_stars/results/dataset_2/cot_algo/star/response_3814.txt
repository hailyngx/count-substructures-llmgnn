Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 8: {10, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 3}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 6, 12}
    
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \(10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 72\)

Therefore, there are a total of 72 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 4, 9>, <0, 4, 10>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 9, 10>, <0, 9, 13>, <0, 10, 13>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 7>, <1, 4, 11>, <1, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 11>, <1, 7, 11>, <3, 9, 10>, <3, 9, 13>, <3, 10, 13>, <4, 5, 2>, <5, 6, 14>, <5, 9, 7>, <5, 12, 2>, <6, 11, 14>, <9, 7, 3>, <11, 8, 12>
   
Therefore, the final answer is [72].
