Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 4) (15, 18) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 9) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 6) (0, 23) (7, 11) (7, 27) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 9) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 24) (17, 28) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 27) (20, 13) (20, 17) (20, 22) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 29) (9, 23) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 21) (29, 11) (29, 9) (4, 3) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 10) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 16) (2, 22) (22, 20) (22, 2) (22, 14) (25, 8) (25, 17) (25, 14) (25, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 1) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 25) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 27) (24, 28) (24, 21) (21, 9) (21, 24) (5, 12) (5, 27) (18, 15) (18, 6) (6, 26) (6, 18) (10, 4) (10, 25) (10, 1) (27, 7) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {23}
- Node 1: {11, 19, 27}
- Node 2: {16, 22}
- Node 3: {4}
- Node 4: {3, 16, 23, 10}
- Node 5: {12, 27}
- Node 6: {18, 26}
- Node 7: {11, 27}
- Node 8: {14, 19, 23, 25}
- Node 9: {11, 16, 21, 23, 29}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 25}
- Node 11: {1, 23, 7, 29}
- Node 12: {5, 16, 19}
- Node 13: {19, 20, 26}
- Node 14: {8, 22, 25, 26}
- Node 15: {18}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 9, 12, 28}
- Node 17: {20, 25, 27, 28}
- Node 18: {6, 15}
- Node 19: {1, 12, 13, 8}
- Node 20: {13, 17, 22}
- Node 21: {9, 24}
- Node 22: {2, 14, 20}
- Node 23: {0, 4, 8, 11, 23}
- Node 24: {21, 28}
- Node 25: {8, 10, 14, 17}
- Node 26: {6, 13, 14}
- Node 27: {1, 5, 7, 17}
- Node 28: {16, 17, 24}
- Node 29: {9, 11}

Nodes 5, 18, and 24 do not have at least 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <1, (11, 19, 27)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <4, (3, 16, 23)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <8, (14, 19, 25)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <9, (11, 16, 29)>
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <11, (1, 23, 29)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <14, (22, 25, 26)>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <16, (2, 4, 28)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star with its 3 neighbors: <17, (20, 25, 27)>

Counting these 3-stars, we have a total of 7 3-stars, so the final answer is [7].
