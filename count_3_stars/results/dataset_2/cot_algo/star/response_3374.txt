Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4
- Node 7: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 35 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 73 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [73], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
