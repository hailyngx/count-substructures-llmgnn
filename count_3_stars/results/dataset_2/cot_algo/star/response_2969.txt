Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (12, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we start by identifying the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 9, 13, 14
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7, 10
- Node 2: 6, 9, 11, 14
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 11
- Node 4: 5, 6, 14
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 10, 11
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 9, 11
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9
- Node 8: 11, 13
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 7, 10, 14
- Node 10: 1, 5, 9, 13
- Node 11: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 12: 13
- Node 13: 0, 8, 10, 12
- Node 14: 0, 2, 4, 9

From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 0, 5, 9, and 13 have 5 or more neighbors. We can calculate the number of 3-stars each node forms:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 44 \), which we represent as [44]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 10>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 13>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <0, 5, 10>
- <0, 9, 14>
- <1, 5, 10>
- <1, 5, 11>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <3, 6, 11>
- <5, 10, 13>
- <9, 10, 13>
- <9, 10, 14>
- <9, 13, 14>
