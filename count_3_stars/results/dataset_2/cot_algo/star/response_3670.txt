Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 24) (2, 5) (2, 29) (2, 11) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 25) (22, 26) (22, 4) (23, 0) (23, 20) (10, 29) (10, 17) (10, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 20) (18, 17) (18, 15) (19, 14) (26, 22) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 1) (6, 21) (6, 25) (6, 15) (28, 25) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 8) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 26) (0, 23) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 27) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 27) (8, 3) (24, 9) (24, 12) (3, 14) (3, 8) (1, 13) (1, 25) (1, 12) (1, 27) (25, 21) (25, 13) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 1) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 1) (20, 21) (20, 23) (20, 4) (27, 14) (27, 8) (27, 1) 

Response:
The nodes from 0 to 29 have the following neighbors:

- 0: 10, 14, 20, 23, 8
- 1: 12, 13, 25, 27
- 2: 5, 11, 29
- 3: 8, 14, 27
- 4: 16, 20, 22
- 5: 2, 9, 13
- 6: 15, 21, 25
- 7: 15, 16, 21
- 8: 0, 9, 15, 27, 3
- 9: 5, 8, 24, 29
- 10: 0, 17, 29
- 11: 2, 14
- 12: 1, 13, 24
- 13: 1, 5, 12, 25
- 14: 0, 3, 11, 27, 19
- 15: 6, 7, 8, 18
- 16: 4, 7, 26
- 17: 10, 18
- 18: 15, 17
- 19: 14
- 20: 4, 21, 23
- 21: 6, 7, 20, 25
- 22: 4, 26
- 23: 0, 20
- 24: 9, 12
- 25: 1, 6, 13, 21, 28
- 26: 16, 22
- 27: 1, 3, 8, 14
- 28: 25
- 29: 2, 9, 10

We can now calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed. 

For the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 5 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 41 unique 3-stars: [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:
