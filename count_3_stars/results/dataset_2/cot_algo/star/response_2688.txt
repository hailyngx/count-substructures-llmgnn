Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 15) (22, 1) (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 12) (6, 13) (6, 1) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 4) (21, 2) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 28) (18, 17) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (23, 4) (23, 24) (23, 27) (28, 21) (28, 18) (28, 27) (29, 8) (29, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 20) (1, 22) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 22) (15, 16) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (17, 18) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 12) (25, 24) (25, 2) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 1) (12, 26) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (20, 13) (20, 19) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 27) (4, 21) (4, 23) (4, 29) (27, 23) (27, 28) (27, 11) (2, 21) (2, 25) (2, 24) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: neighbors {14, 16, 24, 11}
2. Node 1: neighbors {6, 10, 22}
3. Node 2: neighbors {21, 24, 25}
4. Node 3: neighbors {12, 17}
5. Node 4: neighbors {21, 23, 29}
6. Node 5: neighbors {7, 10}
7. Node 6: neighbors {1, 13}
8. Node 7: neighbors {5, 14, 16, 21}
9. Node 8: neighbors {10, 12, 29}
10. Node 9: neighbors {12, 26}
11. Node 10: neighbors {1, 5, 8, 14}
12. Node 11: neighbors {0, 12, 18, 27}
13. Node 12: neighbors {3, 8, 11, 26}
14. Node 13: neighbors {6, 20, 21, 22}
15. Node 15: neighbors {16, 22}
16. Node 17: neighbors {3, 18}
17. Node 18: neighbors {11, 17, 19, 22, 28}
18. Node 19: neighbors {18, 20}
19. Node 20: neighbors {13, 19}
20. Node 21: neighbors {2, 4, 7, 13, 28}
21. Node 22: neighbors {1, 13, 15, 18}
22. Node 23: neighbors {4, 24, 27}
23. Node 24: neighbors {0, 2, 23, 25}
24. Node 25: neighbors {2, 24}
25. Node 26: neighbors {9, 12}
26. Node 27: neighbors {11, 23, 28}
27. Node 28: neighbors {18, 21, 27}
28. Node 29: neighbors {4, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 15, 9, 19, 20, 25

Nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 6: <6, (1, 13, 20)>
- Node 9: <9, (12, 26, 20)>
- Node 19: <19, (18, 20, 13)>, <19, (18, 20, 13)>, <19, (18, 20, 13)>
- Node 20: <20, (13, 19, 26)>, <20, (13, 19, 26)>
- Node 25: <25, (2, 24, 23)>

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
