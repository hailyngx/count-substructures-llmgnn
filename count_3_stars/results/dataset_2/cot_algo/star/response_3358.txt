Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6
Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 2: 3, 5, 6, 7
Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 5
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4
Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9
Node 7: 1, 2, 3
Node 8: 3, 6, 9
Node 9: 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 44.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 3, 8>, <1, 6, 9>, <3, 6, 8>.
