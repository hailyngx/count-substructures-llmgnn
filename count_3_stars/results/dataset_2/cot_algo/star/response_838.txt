Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 26) (25, 21) (17, 3) (17, 29) (17, 5) (17, 15) (29, 17) (29, 19) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 20) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 23) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 28) (18, 26) (18, 21) (26, 25) (26, 18) (26, 23) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 6) (16, 28) (28, 27) (28, 16) (28, 7) (28, 10) (0, 22) (0, 23) (1, 19) (1, 20) (1, 8) (15, 17) (2, 14) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 23) (23, 4) (23, 26) (23, 0) (23, 12) (22, 4) (22, 0) (22, 8) (7, 28) (7, 24) (7, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (20, 13) (20, 1) (20, 6) (6, 19) (6, 11) (6, 20) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 10) (8, 1) (8, 22) (8, 14) (8, 10) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 18) (21, 24) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 7) (24, 21) (10, 5) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {22, 23}
- Node 1: {8, 19, 20}
- Node 2: {14}
- Node 3: {9, 17, 25}
- Node 4: {9, 22, 23}
- Node 5: {10, 13, 17}
- Node 6: {11, 14, 19, 20}
- Node 7: {10, 24, 28}
- Node 8: {1, 10, 14, 22}
- Node 9: {3, 4}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 8, 14, 28}
- Node 11: {6, 19}
- Node 12: {14, 23, 24}
- Node 13: {5, 20}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 15: {17}
- Node 16: {28}
- Node 17: {3, 5, 15, 29}
- Node 18: {21, 26}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 11, 29}
- Node 20: {1, 6, 13}
- Node 21: {18, 25, 27, 24}
- Node 22: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 23: {4, 12, 0}
- Node 24: {7, 12, 21, 27}
- Node 25: {3, 21, 26}
- Node 26: {18, 23, 25}
- Node 27: {21, 24, 28}
- Node 28: {7, 10, 16, 24, 27}
- Node 29: {17, 19}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3, 17, 25, 4, 5, 6, 10, 14, 21, 24, 28, 19 each have 3 or more neighbors.
- In total, there are 12 nodes.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (3, 5, 25, 4, 21, 24, 28):
    - Each forms 1 unique 3-star.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors (17, 6, 10, 14, 19):
    - Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
    - Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars.
    - Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars.
    - Node 10 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars.
    - Node 14 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) unique 3-stars.
    - Node 19 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ 6 \text{ (nodes with exactly 3 neighbors)} + 32 \text{ (nodes with more than 3 neighbors)} = 38 \]

So, the final answer is [38]. 

Unique 3-stars: <3, (9, 17, 25)>, <5, (10, 13, 17)>, <25, (21, 26, 27)>, <4, (9, 22, 23)>, <21, (18, 24, 27)>, <24, (7, 21, 27)>, <28, (7, 10, 16)>, <17, (15, 29, 5)>, <6, (11, 19, 20)>, <10, (8, 14, 28)>, <14, (2, 6, 8)>, <19, (1, 11, 29)>
