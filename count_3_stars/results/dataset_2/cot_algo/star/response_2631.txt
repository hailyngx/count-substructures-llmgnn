Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 4, 11, 12
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8, 11, 14
- Node 4: 2, 5, 9, 13
- Node 5: 4, 6, 9, 10
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 12, 13
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 9, 13
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 8, 13
- Node 10: 0, 12
- Node 11: 2, 3, 12, 14
- Node 12: 0, 2, 6, 10, 11
- Node 13: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 14: 3, 11

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 68. 
Therefore, the final answer is [68].  

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 9, 12)>, <0, (9, 10, 12)>, <0, (7, 10, 12)>, <0, (9, 10, 13)>, <3, (6, 7, 14)>, <3, (6, 11, 14)>, <3, (7, 11, 14)>, <3, (6, 11, 12)>, <4, (2, 9, 13)>, <6, (5, 7, 13)>, <6, (3, 7, 14)>, <6, (3, 11, 14)>, <6, (3, 11, 12)>, <8, (1, 9, 13)>, <9, (5, 8, 13)>, <9, (4, 8, 13)>, <9, (5, 8, 13)>, <12, (2, 11, 12)>.
