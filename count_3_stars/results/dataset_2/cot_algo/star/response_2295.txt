Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 8}

Now let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star structures:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
