Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 8}
Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 7}
Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7, 8}
Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 7}
Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 8}
Node 6: {2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
Node 9: {0, 6}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
