Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star
- Node 1 can form [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars: <1, (17, 25, 26)>, <1, (5, 25, 26)>, <1, (17, 5, 26)>, <1, (17, 5, 26)>

- Node 4 can form [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star
- Node 6 can form [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star
- Node 9 can form [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars: <9, (11, 13, 21)>, <9, (7, 13, 21)>, <9, (7, 11, 21)>, <9, (7, 11, 13)>
- Node 10 can form [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star
- Node 12 can form [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star
- Node 15 can form [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star
- Node 16 can form [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star
- Node 18 can form [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star
- Node 21 can form [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars: <21, (15, 22, 26)>, <21, (15, 26, 21)>, <21, (15, 22, 22)>, <21, (15, 22, 26)>
- Node 22 can form [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star
- Node 25 can form [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars: <25, (1, 12, 19)>, <25, (1, 12, 23)>, <25, (1, 19, 23)>, <25, (12, 19, 23)>

Total number of unique 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 51

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [51].
