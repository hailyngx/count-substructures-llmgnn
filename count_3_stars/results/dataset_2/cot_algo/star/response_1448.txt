Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [64].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 6)>.
