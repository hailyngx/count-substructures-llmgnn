Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 4) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 17) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 8) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 5) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 4) (10, 13) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 5) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 4, 7, 9, 13, 18
- Node 1: 8, 9, 11, 15, 19
- Node 2: 6, 12, 15
- Node 3: 5, 6, 19
- Node 4: 0, 5, 11
- Node 5: 3, 4, 15
- Node 6: 2, 3, 12, 14
- Node 7: 0, 9, 13, 14
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7, 18
- Node 10: 13
- Node 11: 1, 4
- Node 12: 2, 6, 17
- Node 13: 0, 7, 10, 17, 19
- Node 14: 6, 7
- Node 15: 1, 2, 5
- Node 17: 12, 13, 18
- Node 18: 0, 9, 17
- Node 19: 1, 3, 13

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 3 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Now, we apply \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (8, 11, 15)>
- <6, (2, 12, 14)>
- <13, (7, 10, 17)>
