Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 10) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 4) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 1) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 9) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 19) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 15) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (19, 12) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 18) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 16}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {2, 16, 18}
- Node 4: {1, 15, 17}
- Node 5: {8}
- Node 6: {1, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 7: {1, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {8, 12, 14, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 14, 17}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 15}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 19}
- Node 13: {15, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 14: {9, 10}
- Node 15: {4, 11, 13}
- Node 16: {0, 3, 13, 18}
- Node 17: {4, 10, 13}
- Node 18: {3, 6, 13, 16}
- Node 19: {9, 12}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 4, 6, 7>, <1, 6, 11, 12>, <1, 6, 11, 18>, <1, 6, 12, 19>, <2, 3, 16, 18>, <6, 12, 19, 9>, <9, 12, 19, 14>, <13, 15, 16, 18>, <13, 15, 16, 3>, <13, 15, 18, 6>, <13, 16, 18, 3>, <16, 18, 3, 2>, <16, 18, 6, 11>, <16, 18, 6, 13>, <16, 18, 13, 3>, <18, 6, 11, 15>
