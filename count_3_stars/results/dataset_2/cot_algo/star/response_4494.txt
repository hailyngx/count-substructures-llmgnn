Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors are 6, 9, 7
2. Node 1: Neighbors are 9, 4, 7, 3, 8
3. Node 2: Neighbors are 6, 9, 3, 5
4. Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 1, 2, 5
5. Node 4: Neighbors are 6, 8, 5, 1, 3
6. Node 5: Neighbors are 4, 7, 3, 2
7. Node 6: Neighbors are 7, 2, 4, 0
8. Node 7: Neighbors are 6, 9, 0, 5, 1
9. Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 1
10. Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 1, 7, 0

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing up the 3-stars formed by each node, we get 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 1, 2)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 3)>
<6, (7, 2, 4)>
<7, (6, 9, 0)>
<9, (2, 1, 7)>
