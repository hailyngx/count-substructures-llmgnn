Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph and their corresponding neighbors are:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9  
Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 8  
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9  
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7  
Node 4: 2, 3, 7, 8  
Node 5: 1, 8  
Node 6: 0, 1  
Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9  
Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9  
Node 9: 0, 2, 7, 8  

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph. We will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 72 \). Therefore, the final answer is [72].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 0)>
<8, (9, 0, 2)>
