Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 11) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11
- Node 2: 5, 6, 11, 12
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 8, 14
- Node 4: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 13, 14
- Node 6: 1, 2, 14
- Node 7: 4, 12, 14
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 4, 10, 13
- Node 10: 0, 1, 9, 13, 14
- Node 11: 1, 2, 13
- Node 12: 0, 2, 7
- Node 13: 5, 9, 10, 11
- Node 14: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 92

Therefore, the final answer is [92].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 10)>
<1, (0, 10, 13)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 14)>
<10, (0, 1, 13)>
<13, (1, 5, 11)>
<14, (1, 5, 10)>
