Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 14) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 8) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 0) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 5) (19, 0) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 17) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 18) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {14, 19}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 12, 15}
- Node 2: {5, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 18}
- Node 5: {2, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {10, 13, 15}
- Node 9: {11, 16, 18}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 5, 8, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 9, 16}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 13: {8}
- Node 14: {0, 16}
- Node 15: {1, 8, 17}
- Node 16: {9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 17: {5, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {4, 9, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 5}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 13 has 1 neighbor, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.

Adding up all the possibilities, we find that there are a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 32 \) 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [32].
