Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 9, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 14: {5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 5: Can form a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, 12
- Node 9: Can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, 8
- Node 12: Can form a 3-star with nodes 11, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 3
Therefore, the final answer is [3].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <5, 9, 10, 12>
- <9, 4, 7, 8>
- <12, 11, 14>
