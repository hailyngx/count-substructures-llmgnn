Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {5, 2}
Node 1 neighbors: {5, 3, 6, 4}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 9, 3, 8, 7, 0} 
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 8}
Node 4 neighbors: {9, 1, 8, 6}
Node 5 neighbors: {9, 6, 2, 1, 0, 7}
Node 6 neighbors: {5, 1, 4, 7}
Node 7 neighbors: {5, 9, 6, 2}
Node 8 neighbors: {3, 4, 2}
Node 9 neighbors: {5, 4, 2, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph by checking nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors: <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (2, 0, 7)>, <5, (9, 7, 6)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: <2, (5, 9, 3)>, <2, (5, 3, 7)>, <2, (9, 7, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: <1, (5, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: <4, (9, 1, 6)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: <6, (5, 1, 7)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: <7, (5, 2, 9)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 16, which is represented as [16].
