Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 13) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 15) (12, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 17) (0, 3) (0, 17) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 17) (14, 1) (14, 2) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 17}
- Node 1: {6, 14, 15}
- Node 2: {10, 12, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 18, 15}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 18}
- Node 7: {5, 13, 16}
- Node 8: {6, 10, 17, 19}
- Node 9: {13, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 11: {4, 17, 19}
- Node 12: {2, 15}
- Node 13: {7, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 2}
- Node 15: {1, 3, 12, 9}
- Node 16: {7}
- Node 17: {0, 8, 11, 18}
- Node 18: {3, 6, 9, 17}
- Node 19: {2, 8, 9, 11}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 1, Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2, Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4, Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6, Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8, Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9, Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10, Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11, Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15, Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17, Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18, Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19, Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
