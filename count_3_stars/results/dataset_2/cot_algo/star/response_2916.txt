Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 16) (26, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 16) (8, 18) (8, 10) (8, 11) (2, 18) (2, 23) (28, 14) (28, 24) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 12) (29, 26) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 25) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 8) (11, 3) (15, 1) (15, 21) (15, 19) (20, 7) (20, 14) (7, 20) (7, 19) (25, 29) (25, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) (16, 24) (0, 22) (0, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 5) (6, 24) (6, 23) (6, 12) (24, 9) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 6) (24, 27) (19, 15) (19, 7) (13, 21) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 10) (5, 23) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 6) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 3) (27, 24) (14, 28) (14, 20) (14, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 22, 17
Node 1: 15, 4
Node 2: 18, 23
Node 3: 26, 17, 11
Node 4: 1, 10, 16
Node 5: 22, 25, 10, 23
Node 6: 24, 23, 12
Node 7: 20, 19
Node 8: 18, 10, 11
Node 9: 26, 24
Node 10: 22, 4, 8, 5
Node 11: 8, 3
Node 12: 6, 17
Node 13: 21, 14
Node 14: 28, 20, 13
Node 15: 1, 21, 19
Node 16: 26, 4, 24
Node 17: 29, 3, 0, 12
Node 18: 22, 2, 8
Node 19: 15, 7
Node 20: 7, 14
Node 21: 13, 15, 23
Node 22: 18, 27, 5, 10, 0
Node 23: 21, 2, 6, 5
Node 24: 9, 28, 16, 6, 27
Node 25: 5, 29
Node 26: 9, 29, 16, 3
Node 27: 22, 29, 3, 24
Node 28: 14, 24
Node 29: 26, 17, 27, 25

Next, we identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 17, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{17}{3} + \binom{22}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{24}{3} + \binom{26}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{29}{3} = 5 + 1540 + 1771 + 2024 + 2600 + 2925 + 3654 = 12919\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 12919. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<17, (0, 12, 29)>, <22, (0, 5, 10)>, <23, (2, 5, 6)>, <24, (6, 27, 28)>, <26, (3, 16, 29)>, <27, (3, 24, 29)>, <29, (17, 25, 27)>
