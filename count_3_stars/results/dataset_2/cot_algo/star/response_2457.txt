Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 2) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, we can first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 5, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 11: {4, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 9, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors (more than 3), which can form 20 unique 3-stars.
- Node 1, 3, 6, 9, and 14 have 5 neighbors (more than 3), each can form 10 unique 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 20 + (5*10) = 70, therefore [70].

Now listing the unique 3-stars:
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 11)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 14)>
- <4, (5, 9, 14)>
- <4, (5, 11, 14)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 14)>
- <4, (6, 9, 14)>
- <4, (8, 9, 14)>
- <1, (0, 2, 9)>
- <1, (0, 5, 14)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 9, 10)>
- <1, (5, 9, 14)>
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 9, 13)>
- <3, (6, 9, 13)>
- <3, (9, 13, 14)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (3, 4, 13)>
- <6, (4, 5, 13)>
- <9, (2, 4, 14)>
- <9, (2, 10, 14)>
- <9, (4, 10, 14)>
- <9, (10, 13, 14)>
- <14, (1, 4, 11)>
- <14, (1, 4, 14)>
- <14, (4, 11, 12)>
- <14, (4, 11, 14)>
- <14, (4, 12, 11)>
