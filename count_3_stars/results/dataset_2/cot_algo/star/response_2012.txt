Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 28) (6, 5) (6, 19) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 11) (4, 25) (4, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 16) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 25) (0, 2) (0, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 13) (27, 9) (27, 10) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 21) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 11) (21, 16) (21, 19) (21, 12) (21, 14) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 29) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 19) (3, 18) (3, 24) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 20) (11, 25) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 12) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 14) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 22) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 14) (29, 10) (29, 23) (29, 13) (29, 14) (14, 21) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 29) (19, 6) (19, 21) (19, 24) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the adjacency list for each node:

Node 0: 2, 5
Node 1: 7, 13, 15, 28, 5
Node 2: 0, 8, 17
Node 3: 18, 24
Node 4: 17, 25
Node 5: 0, 1, 16, 22, 6
Node 6: 19, 5
Node 7: 8, 1
Node 8: 2, 7
Node 9: 26, 27
Node 10: 18, 27, 29
Node 11: 20, 25
Node 12: 14, 15, 21, 22, 24
Node 13: 1, 14, 20, 29
Node 14: 13, 21, 12, 23, 29
Node 15: 1, 12, 20
Node 16: 5, 21, 28
Node 17: 2, 4, 22
Node 18: 2, 3, 10
Node 19: 6, 21, 24
Node 20: 1, 11, 13
Node 21: 12, 14, 16, 19
Node 22: 5, 12, 17
Node 23: 14, 29
Node 24: 3, 12, 19
Node 25: 4, 11, 28
Node 26: 9, 28
Node 27: 9, 10
Node 28: 1, 16, 25, 26
Node 29: 10, 13, 14, 23

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by checking each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (7, 28, 15)>
- Node 5 forms 3 3-stars: <5, (0, 22, 6)>, <5, (1, 28, 16)>, <5, (1, 22, 17)>
- Node 12 forms 4 3-stars: <12, (14, 21, 22)>, <12, (15, 21, 24)>, <12, (19, 21, 24)>, <12, (12, 13, 14)>
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star: <13, (1, 29, 14)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (21, 23, 29)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, (1, 20, 12)>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star: <16, (5, 28, 21)>
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star: <17, (2, 4, 22)>
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star: <21, (12, 14, 16)>
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star: <22, (5, 12, 17)>
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star: <24, (12, 19, 21)>
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star: <25, (11, 28, 4)>
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star: <28, (1, 26, 4)>
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star: <29, (13, 14, 23)>
  
Adding them up, we have a total of [17] unique 3-stars in the graph.
