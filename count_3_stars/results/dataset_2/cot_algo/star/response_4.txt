Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we need to identify the number of 3-stars formed in the graph. 

First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
1. Node 0: {6, 8, 7, 3}
2. Node 1: {8, 7, 2}
3. Node 2: {6, 9, 4, 7, 3, 1}
4. Node 3: {6, 4, 5, 0, 2}
5. Node 4: {9, 8, 3, 2}
6. Node 5: {8, 3, 7}
7. Node 6: {3, 2, 8, 0}
8. Node 7: {5, 0, 2, 1}
9. Node 8: {6, 4, 5, 0, 1}
10. Node 9: {4, 2}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 8, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 4)>
<3, (6, 4, 5)>
<4, (9, 8, 3)>
<8, (6, 5, 0)>
