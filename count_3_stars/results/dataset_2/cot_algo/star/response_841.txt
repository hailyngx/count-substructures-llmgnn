Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

1: {6, 9, 5}
2: {9, 1, 5}
3: {9, 4, 7, 5}
4: {6, 9, 7, 3}
5: {1, 3, 2}
6: {9, 1, 7, 8, 4, 0}
7: {6, 4, 3, 0}
8: {6, 0}
9: {6, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each one forms:

Node 1 forms 3-stars: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 2 forms 3-stars: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3 forms 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4 forms 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 5 forms 3-stars: 0 (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6 forms 3-stars: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 7 forms 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8 forms 3-stars: 0 (has less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9 forms 3-stars: inom{6}{3} = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 54

Therefore, the final result is [54], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 6, 9>
<3, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
