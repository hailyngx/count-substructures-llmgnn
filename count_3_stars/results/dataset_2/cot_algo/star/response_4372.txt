Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

For node 5:
It has 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 2, and 8.
There are 4 unique 3-stars formed with node 5 as the center:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>

For node 9:
It has 5 neighbors: 5, 11, 1, 13, and 12.
There are 10 unique 3-stars formed with node 9 as the center:
<9, (5, 11, 1)>, <9, (5, 11, 13)>, <9, (5, 11, 12)>, <9, (5, 1, 13)>, <9, (5, 1, 12)>, <9, (5, 13, 12)>, 
<9, (11, 1, 13)>, <9, (11, 1, 12)>, <9, (11, 13, 12)>, <9, (1, 13, 12)>

For node 10:
It has 5 neighbors: 4, 11, 12, 14, and 2.
There are 10 unique 3-stars formed with node 10 as the center:
<10, (4, 11, 12)>, <10, (4, 11, 14)>, <10, (4, 11, 2)>, <10, (4, 12, 14)>, <10, (4, 12, 2)>, 
<10, (4, 14, 2)>, <10, (11, 12, 14)>, <10, (11, 12, 2)>, <10, (11, 14, 2)>, <10, (12, 14, 2)>

For node 11:
It has 6 neighbors: 9, 10, 3, 14, 8, and 2.
There are 15 unique 3-stars formed with node 11 as the center:
<11, (9, 10, 3)>, <11, (9, 10, 14)>, <11, (9, 10, 8)>, <11, (9, 10, 2)>, <11, (9, 3, 14)>,
<11, (9, 3, 8)>, <11, (9, 3, 2)>, <11, (9, 14, 8)>, <11, (9, 14, 2)>, <11, (9, 8, 2)>,
<11, (10, 3, 14)>, <11, (10, 3, 8)>, <11, (10, 3, 2)>, <11, (10, 14, 8)>, <11, (10, 14, 2)>

For node 12:
It has 4 neighbors: 9, 10, 8, and 13.
There are 4 unique 3-stars formed with node 12 as the center:
<12, (9, 10, 8)>, <12, (9, 10, 13)>, <12, (9, 8, 13)>, <12, (10, 8, 13)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [43].
