Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form C(6, 3) = 20 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 20 (from node 0) + 20 (from node 4) + 10 (from node 6) = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 7)>
<6, (3, 8, 7)>
