Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 12) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 10, 6, 3, 12}
- Node 1: {10, 4, 14, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 1}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 0, 14, 12}
- Node 4: {10, 11, 12, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 13, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 8, 12, 1}
- Node 8: {11, 7, 1}
- Node 9: {14, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 6, 1, 4}
- Node 11: {10, 8, 4}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 4, 3}
- Node 13: {3, 6}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 3, 1}

Now, we need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph. We will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 61 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 9, 10>
- <0, 9, 6>
- <0, 9, 3>
- <0, 9, 12>
- <0, 10, 6>
- <0, 10, 3>
- <0, 10, 12>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <0, 6, 12>
- <1, 10, 4>
- <1, 10, 7>
- <1, 10, 2>
- <1, 4, 12>
- <3, 9, 14>
- <3, 9, 12>
- <3, 14, 1>
- <3, 14, 7>
- <4, 10, 12>
- <5, 6, 13>
- <5, 6, 2>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 14>
- <7, 8, 1>
- <7, 8, 12>
