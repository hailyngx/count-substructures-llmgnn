Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {20, 16, 29, 26}
- Node 1: {6, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 11}
- Node 3: {9, 21, 29}
- Node 4: {9, 5, 19}
- Node 5: {23, 4}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 15, 2}
- Node 7: {12, 25, 14, 27}
- Node 8: {28, 10, 25}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 21, 3}
- Node 10: {8, 16, 27, 22}
- Node 11: {2}
- Node 12: {7, 29}
- Node 13: {23, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 7, 1}
- Node 15: {6, 20, 28}
- Node 16: {0, 22, 10}
- Node 17: {19, 22}
- Node 18: {28, 23}
- Node 19: {25, 4, 17}
- Node 20: {0, 15, 28, 27}
- Node 21: {9, 3}
- Node 22: {25, 17, 16, 10}
- Node 23: {13, 5, 18}
- Node 24: {29}
- Node 25: {8, 7, 26, 19, 22}
- Node 26: {0, 25, 29}
- Node 27: {20, 7, 10}
- Node 28: {8, 20, 15, 18}
- Node 29: {0, 3, 26, 24}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 6, 28, 9, 25, 20, 3, 4, 22, 7, 15, 16, 19, and 29.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 6, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 28, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 25, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 20, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 22, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 15, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 16, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 19, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 29, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 36 \). 

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [36].
