Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (12, 14) (12, 19) (6, 13) (6, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 15) (9, 3) (9, 2) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 18) (10, 3) (10, 8) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 15) (5, 16) (5, 17) (19, 16) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's build the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 19}
- Node 2: {8, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 10, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 11, 15}
- Node 5: {16, 17}
- Node 6: {7, 13}
- Node 7: {6, 17}
- Node 8: {2, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 3}
- Node 10: {3, 8}
- Node 11: {4, 8, 16, 18}
- Node 12: {14, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 8, 18}
- Node 14: {12, 17, 18}
- Node 15: {4, 17, 18}
- Node 16: {5, 11, 19}
- Node 17: {5, 7, 14, 15}
- Node 18: {11, 13, 14, 15}
- Node 19: {1, 3, 12, 16}

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed by each:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 3, 19>
<3, 8, 10>
<3, 8, 19>
<3, 10, 19>
<8, 11, 13>
<8, 11, 16>
<8, 11, 18>
<8, 13, 16>
<8, 13, 18>
<11, 16, 19>
<11, 18, 19>
<13, 16, 18>
<14, 17, 18>
<17, 14, 15>
<17, 15, 18>
<17, 14, 18>
<17, 14, 7>
<17, 7, 15>
<17, 15, 4>
<17, 4, 15>
<18, 11, 13>
<18, 13, 15>
<18, 11, 15>
<18, 14, 15>
<19, 12, 16>
<19, 3, 16>
<19, 3, 12>
