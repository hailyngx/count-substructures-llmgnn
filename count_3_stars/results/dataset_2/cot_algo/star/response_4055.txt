Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 10) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. First, we need to determine the neighbor set for each node:
   - Node 0: {7, 11, 6, 9}
   - Node 1: {4, 6, 11, 5, 9}
   - Node 2: {3, 12, 8, 5, 9}
   - Node 3: {2, 14, 5}
   - Node 4: {7, 10, 1}
   - Node 5: {1, 3, 2, 13, 10}
   - Node 6: {7, 1, 0, 10}
   - Node 7: {4, 12, 0, 6, 14}
   - Node 8: {2, 9, 14, 10}
   - Node 9: {1, 2, 8, 0, 11}
   - Node 10: {4, 8, 5, 6, 14}
   - Node 11: {1, 0, 9}
   - Node 12: {7, 2, 14}
   - Node 13: {5}
   - Node 14: {7, 3, 12, 8, 10}

2. Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
   - Nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 14 have three or more neighbors.

3. Calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
   - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
     <0, (7, 11, 6)>, <0, (7, 11, 9)>, <0, (7, 6, 9)>, <0, (11, 6, 9)>
   - Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
     <1, (4, 6, 11)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 11, 9)>, <1, (6, 11, 5)>, <1, (6, 11, 9)>, <1, (6, 5, 9)>, <1, (11, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 10)>, <1, (5, 9, 13)>, <1, (9, 10, 13)>
   - Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
     <2, (3, 12, 8)>, <2, (3, 12, 9)>, <2, (3, 12, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 5)>, <2, (12, 8, 14)>, <2, (8, 14, 10)>, <2, (8, 14, 10)>, <2, (8, 10, 10)>, <2, (5, 14, 10)>, <2, (10, 14, 10)>
   - Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
     <5, (1, 3, 2)>, <5, (1, 3, 10)>, <5, (1, 3, 2)>, <5, (1, 3, 14)>, <5, (1, 2, 14)>, <5, (3, 14, 10)>, <5, (2, 14, 10)>, <5, (2, 14, 10)>, <5, (2, 14, 10)>, <5, (14, 10, 13)>
   - Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
     <6, (1, 7, 10)>
   - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
     <7, (4, 6, 10)>, <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 10, 14)>, <7, (6, 10, 14)>, <7, (6, 10, 14)>, <7, (6, 10, 14)>, <7, (10, 8, 14)>, <7, (10, 8, 14)>, <7, (10, 8, 14)>, <7, (8, 14, 10)>
   - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
     <8, (2, 9, 14)>, <8, (2, 9, 10)>, <8, (2, 9, 10)>, <8, (9, 10, 14)>
   - Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
     <9, (1, 2, 11)>, <9, (1, 2, 0)>, <9, (1, 2, 11)>, <9, (1, 2, 0)>, <9, (2, 0, 11)>, <9, (2, 0, 11)>, <9, (2, 0, 11)>, <9, (0, 11, 9)>, <9, (0, 11, 9)>, <9, (0, 11, 9)>
   - Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
     <10, (4, 8, 5)>, <10, (4, 8, 6)>, <10, (4, 8, 14)>, <10, (4, 8, 14)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>
   - Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
     <14, (7, 12, 8)>, <14, (7, 12, 10)>, <14, (7, 12, 10)>, <14, (12, 2, 10)>, <14, (8, 10, 6)>, <14, (8, 10, 6)>, <14, (8, 10, 6)>, <14, (8, 10, 6)>, <14, (10, 6, 7)>, <14, (10, 6, 7)>

4. Sum up the total number of 3-stars:
   Total = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 79

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [79]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 11, 6)>, <0, (7, 11, 9)>, <0, (7, 6, 9)>, <0, (11, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 11)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 11, 9)>, <1, (6, 11, 5)>, <1, (6, 11, 9)>, <1, (6, 5, 9)>, <1, (11, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 10)>, <1, (5, 9, 13)>, <1, (9, 10, 13)>, <2, (3, 12, 8)>, <2, (3, 12, 9)>, <2, (3, 12, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 5)>, <2, (12, 8, 14)>, <2, (8, 14, 10)>, <2, (8, 10, 10)>, <2, (5, 14, 10)>, <5, (1, 3, 2)>, <5, (1, 3, 10)>, <5, (1, 3, 14)>, <5, (1, 2, 14)>, <5, (3, 14, 10)>, <5, (2, 14, 10)>, <5, (14, 10, 13)>, <6, (1, 7, 10)>, <7, (4, 6, 10)>, <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 10, 14)>, <7, (6, 10, 14)>, <7, (6, 10, 14)>, <7, (6, 10, 14)>, <7, (10, 8, 14)>, <7, (10, 8, 14)>, <7, (10, 8, 14)>, <7, (8, 14, 10)>, <8, (2, 9, 14)>, <8, (2, 9, 10)>, <8, (2, 9, 10)>, <8, (9, 10, 14)>, <9, (1, 2, 11)>, <9, (1, 2, 0)>, <9, (1, 2, 11)>, <9, (1, 2, 0)>, <9, (2, 0, 11)>, <9, (2, 0, 11)>, <9, (2, 0, 11)>, <9, (0, 11, 9)>, <9, (0, 11, 9)>, <9, (0, 11, 9)>, <10, (4, 8, 5)>, <10, (4, 8, 6)>, <10, (4, 8, 14)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 5)>, <14, (7, 12, 8)>, <14, (7, 12, 10)>, <14, (12, 2, 10)>, <14, (8, 10, 6)>, <14, (10, 6, 7)>
