Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 17) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 25) (29, 6) (10, 21) (10, 15) (11, 8) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 9) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 5) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 3) (4, 2) (4, 20) (4, 28) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 24) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 23) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 10) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 6) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 19) (22, 3) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 23) (8, 11) (8, 5) (28, 0) (28, 4) (28, 7) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 29) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 25) (24, 19) (24, 7) (25, 2) (25, 14) (17, 21) (17, 18) (17, 12) (13, 20) (13, 6) (13, 3) (3, 26) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {20, 7, 16, 28, 9}
- Node 1: {21, 15, 22}
- Node 2: {4, 15, 20, 25}
- Node 3: {26, 22, 5, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 20, 28}
- Node 5: {20, 8, 3}
- Node 6: {29, 16, 14, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 12, 24, 28}
- Node 8: {11, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 18, 23}
- Node 10: {21, 15}
- Node 11: {8}
- Node 12: {7, 17, 23}
- Node 13: {20, 6, 3}
- Node 14: {16, 6, 25}
- Node 15: {1, 2, 10}
- Node 16: {0, 6, 14}
- Node 17: {21, 18, 12}
- Node 18: {19, 9, 17}
- Node 19: {26, 18, 22, 24}
- Node 20: {2, 0, 13, 4, 5}
- Node 21: {1, 10, 22, 17}
- Node 22: {1, 21, 19, 3}
- Node 23: {26, 12, 9}
- Node 24: {19, 7}
- Node 25: {2, 14}
- Node 26: {19, 23, 3}
- Node 28: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 29: {6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. We can see that nodes 1, 19, and 21 each have exactly 3 neighbors, so they form 3-stars. Node 14 has 3 neighbors, but it has already been accounted for in the 3-star centered at node 25. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3] and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (21, 15, 22)>
- <19, (26, 18, 22)>
- <21, (1, 10, 17)>
