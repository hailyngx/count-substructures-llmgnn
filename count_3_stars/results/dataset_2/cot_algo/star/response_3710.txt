Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 12) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 11) (14, 16) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 26) (23, 22) (23, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 21) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 6) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 9) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 2) (0, 13) (0, 2) (6, 8) (6, 21) (6, 10) (25, 15) (25, 17) (7, 5) (11, 13) (11, 27) (11, 5) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 4) (1, 18) (29, 8) (29, 1) (29, 4) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 5) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 3) (16, 14) (16, 24) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 5) (20, 1) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 1) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 10) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 24) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 13
- Node 1: 4, 18, 20, 29
- Node 2: 0, 8, 21, 26
- Node 3: 5, 9, 19, 23
- Node 4: 1, 10, 29
- Node 5: 3, 5, 7, 11, 24
- Node 6: 8, 10, 21
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 2, 6, 28, 29
- Node 9: 3, 21, 28
- Node 10: 4, 6, 12
- Node 11: 5, 13, 27
- Node 12: 10, 15, 24
- Node 13: 0, 11, 22, 26
- Node 14: 16
- Node 15: 12, 19, 25
- Node 16: 14, 24
- Node 17: 18, 25, 26
- Node 18: 1, 17, 27
- Node 19: 3, 15, 28
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 2, 6, 9, 28
- Node 22: 13, 23, 26, 27
- Node 23: 3, 22
- Node 24: 5, 12, 16
- Node 25: 15, 17
- Node 26: 2, 13, 17, 22
- Node 27: 11, 18, 22
- Node 28: 8, 9, 19, 21
- Node 29: 1, 4, 8

Now, let's check each node for possible 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33].

Some unique 3-stars found are <1, (4, 18, 20)>, <8, (2, 21, 28)>, <28, (8, 9, 21)>, <21, (2, 6, 28)>, <22, (13, 26, 27)>, and so on.
