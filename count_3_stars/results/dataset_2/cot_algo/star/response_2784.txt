Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (14, 11) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 1, 10}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 7, 13, 12, 0}
- Node 2: {4, 12, 11}
- Node 3: {6, 13, 12, 11, 10}
- Node 4: {7, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 8, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 7, 3, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 6, 10, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 1}
- Node 10: {7, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 11: {13, 12, 2, 3, 14}
- Node 12: {7, 6, 2, 11, 3, 1}
- Node 13: {5, 1, 3, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1, Node 12, and Node 13 each have 6 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3, Node 10, and Node 7 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2 and Node 6 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 4 and Node 5 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 8 and Node 9 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [20 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [109] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (4, 7, 12)>
- <1, (1, 7, 12)>
- <1, (1, 12, 13)>
- <1, (0, 1, 5)>
- <12, (3, 11, 13)>
- <12, (2, 11, 12)>
- <12, (2, 4, 12)>
- <12, (4, 7, 12)>
- <13, (1, 11, 12)>
- <13, (1, 3, 13)>
- <13, (3, 11, 13)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <10, (0, 3, 10)>
- <10, (0, 7, 10)>
- <10, (3, 7, 10)>
