Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 5) (15, 25) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 8) (9, 29) (9, 18) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 16) (17, 10) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 25) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 25) (21, 28) (21, 5) (21, 2) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 21) (28, 11) (11, 14) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 26) (11, 20) (26, 11) (26, 29) (20, 11) (20, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 8) (29, 4) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 20) (4, 29) (4, 16) (3, 2) (23, 18) (23, 24) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 1) (18, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 24) (8, 27) (8, 29) (8, 18) (8, 24) (24, 23) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (2, 10) (2, 21) (2, 3) (2, 24) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 12) (25, 14) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 19) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 21) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 1: {7, 11, 18, 24}
- Node 2: {3, 10, 21, 24}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {12, 16, 20, 22, 29}
- Node 5: {10, 21, 22}
- Node 7: {1, 12, 14, 27}
- Node 8: {18, 24, 27, 29}
- Node 9: {18, 29}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 16, 17}
- Node 11: {1, 14, 20, 26, 28}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 25, 27}
- Node 13: {19, 22, 25}
- Node 14: {7, 11, 25, 28}
- Node 15: {25}
- Node 16: {4, 10, 19}
- Node 17: {10}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 9, 23}
- Node 19: {13, 16}
- Node 20: {4, 11}
- Node 21: {2, 5, 28}
- Node 22: {4, 13, 5, 28}
- Node 23: {18, 24}
- Node 24: {1, 8, 23, 2}
- Node 25: {12, 13, 14, 15}
- Node 26: {11, 29}
- Node 27: {7, 8, 12}
- Node 28: {11, 14, 21, 22}
- Node 29: {4, 8, 9, 26}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: Can form a 3-star with neighbors (10, 21, 24): <2, (10, 21, 24)>
- Node 4: Can form a 3-star with neighbors (12, 16, 22), (4, 12, 29), (4, 20, 29): <4, (12, 16, 22)>, <4, (12, 29, 20)>
- Node 5: Can form a 3-star with neighbors (10, 21, 22): <5, (10, 21, 22)>
- Node 8: Can form a 3-star with neighbors (18, 24, 29): <8, (18, 24, 29)>
- Node 9: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 20: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 22: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 23: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: Cannot form a 3-star (has < 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (10, 21, 24)>, <4, (12, 16, 22)>, <4, (12, 29, 20)>, <5, (10, 21, 22)>.
