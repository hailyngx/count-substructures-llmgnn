Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 11) (17, 14) (17, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (18, 15) (18, 6) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 16) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 13) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 16) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 16}
- Node 2: {5, 10}
- Node 3: {8, 14, 15}
- Node 4: {13, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 11, 2}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 10, 12, 18}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {3, 11, 19}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 7, 16}
- Node 11: {5, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {6, 13, 16}
- Node 13: {4, 12, 15, 19}
- Node 14: {3, 11, 17}
- Node 15: {3, 13, 18}
- Node 16: {1, 10, 12}
- Node 17: {0, 14}
- Node 18: {6, 15}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 13}

Now we will look for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 17)>
<0, (1, 7, 17)>
<0, (5, 7, 17)>
<5, (1, 6, 11)>
<5, (2, 6, 11)>
<5, (6, 10, 11)>
<5, (6, 11, 18)>
<6, (7, 10, 12)>
<6, (10, 12, 16)>
<13, (4, 12, 19)>
<13, (12, 16, 19)>

Thus, the final answer is [32].
