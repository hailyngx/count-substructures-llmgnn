Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 24) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 16) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 14) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 27) (23, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 2) (13, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 0) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 21) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 1) (9, 22) (9, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 28) (11, 14) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 0) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 12) (21, 18) (26, 3) (26, 23) (7, 19) (10, 14) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 27) (14, 22) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 10) (15, 19) (15, 12) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 17) (16, 25) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 17) (12, 23) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 15) (27, 23) (27, 19) (24, 29) (24, 5) (24, 18) (1, 28) (1, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 17}
- Node 1: {19, 28}
- Node 2: {13, 17, 29}
- Node 3: {0, 11, 20, 25, 26}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 11, 16}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 16, 18, 24}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {19}
- Node 8: {4, 13}
- Node 9: {14, 22}
- Node 10: {14}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 14, 28}
- Node 12: {5, 15, 20, 23}
- Node 13: {2, 8}
- Node 14: {9, 10, 11, 22}
- Node 15: {12, 19}
- Node 16: {4, 5, 17, 25}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 16, 20}
- Node 18: {5, 19, 21, 24}
- Node 19: {1, 7, 15, 18, 27}
- Node 20: {3, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 21: {18}
- Node 22: {9, 14, 23}
- Node 23: {12, 22, 26, 27}
- Node 24: {5, 18, 29}
- Node 25: {3, 16}
- Node 26: {3, 23}
- Node 27: {19, 23}
- Node 28: {1, 11, 29}
- Node 29: {2, 24, 28}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
<0, (3, 4, 6)>

- Node 5, 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
<5, (6, 12, 16)>, <5, (6, 16, 18)>, <5, (6, 18, 24)>, <5, (12, 16, 18)>, <5, (12, 18, 24)>, <5, (16, 18, 24)>, <5, (6, 12, 18)>, <5, (6, 12, 24)>, <5, (12, 16, 24)>, <5, (16, 18, 24)>

- Node 12, 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
<12, (15, 20, 23)>

- Node 19, 3-stars: inom{5}{3} = 10
<19, (7, 18, 27)>, <19, (15, 18, 27)>, <19, (7, 15, 27)>, <19, (7, 15, 18)>, <19, (7, 18, 19)>, <19, (7, 18, 1)>, <19, (7, 18, 19)>, <19, (15, 18, 19)>, <19, (15, 18, 1)>, <19, (18, 27, 1)>

- Node 22, 3-stars: inom{3}{3} = 1
<22, (9, 14, 23)>

- Node 23, 3-stars: inom{4}{3} = 4
<23, (12, 26, 27)>

- Node 24, 3-stars: inom{3}{3} = 1
<24, (5, 18, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
