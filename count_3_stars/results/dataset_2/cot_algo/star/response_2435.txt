Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 18) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 16) (13, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 4) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 18) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 10}
- Node 1: {4, 14, 17}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 11, 15}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {12, 14}
- Node 6: {12, 17, 19}
- Node 7: {2, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 8: {13, 14, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 10}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 11: {3, 4, 19}
- Node 12: {5, 6, 17, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 16}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 15: {3, 7}
- Node 16: {7, 13, 18}
- Node 17: {1, 6, 12}
- Node 18: {7, 12, 16}
- Node 19: {6, 8, 11}

From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 1, 4, 12, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (4, 17, 1)>, <4, (1, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 9, 4)>, <4, (2, 4, 9)>, <4, (9, 11, 4)>, <12, (5, 6, 12)>, <12, (6, 17, 12)>, <12, (12, 18, 12)>, <12, (12, 5, 12)>, <14, (1, 14, 5)>.
