Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 12) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 3: {13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 8, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 11}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 10: {12, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 5}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 10, 14}

Next, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 80 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [80]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 11)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 12)>
<5, (1, 8, 13)>
<6, (2, 8, 11)>
<7, (0, 4, 11)>
<11, (0, 6, 12)>
<12, (0, 4, 11)>
<14, (1, 4, 10)>
