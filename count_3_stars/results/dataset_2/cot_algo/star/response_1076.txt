Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {8, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 4}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 0, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 possible 3-stars.
- For Node 1, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 possible 3-stars.
- For Node 3, there are inom{6}{3} = 20 possible 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are inom{6}{3} = 20 possible 3-stars.
- For Node 7, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 possible 3-stars.
- For Node 8, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 possible 3-stars.
- For Node 9, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 possible 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 72

Therefore, the final answer is [72].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (8, 3, 6)>
- <3, (0, 9, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (2, 1, 7)>
- <3, (7, 0, 9)>
- <3, (6, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 3)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 1, 9)>
- <6, (4, 8, 1)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <7, (0, 2, 9)>
- <7, (3, 1, 6)>
- <7, (6, 1, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 0)>
- <9, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (6, 1, 7)>
