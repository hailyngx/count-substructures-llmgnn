Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 2, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

Next, we need to identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 26 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 2, 9>
<1, 3, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 9>
<2, 6, 7>
<3, 7, 8>
<4, 6, 9>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 9>
