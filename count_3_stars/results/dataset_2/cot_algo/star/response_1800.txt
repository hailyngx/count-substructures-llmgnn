Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 6, 2}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 6, 0, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 7, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {8, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 3}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 3, 1, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<{0, 8, 6}, {1, 9, 4}, {2, 5, 4}, {2, 4, 6}, {2, 4, 1}, {2, 6, 0}, {3, 5, 9}, {3, 5, 4}, {3, 9, 1}, {3, 9, 7}, {3, 4, 7}, {3, 7, 9}, {3, 7, 4}, {4, 8, 0}, {6, 8, 0}, {8, 9, 4}, {8, 4, 6}, {8, 4, 1}, {8, 0, 6}, {9, 4, 7}>
