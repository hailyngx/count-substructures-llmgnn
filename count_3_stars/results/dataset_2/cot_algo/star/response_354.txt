Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph using an adjacency list:

1: 5, 4
2: 5, 7, 0
3: 5, 4, 6, 2
4: 9, 7, 1, 3
5: 9, 2, 1, 3, 7
6: 9, 8, 0, 3
7: 5, 9, 4, 2, 1
8: 9, 4, 6
9: 5, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0
0: 9, 6, 2

Now, for each node, let's find the neighbors:

1: (5, 4, 7)
2: (5, 7, 0, 3)
3: (5, 4, 6, 2)
4: (9, 7, 1, 3)
5: (9, 2, 1, 3, 7)
6: (9, 8, 0, 3)
7: (5, 9, 4, 2, 1)
8: (9, 4, 6)
9: (5, 6, 8, 7, 0)
0: (9, 6, 2)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 5 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 4)>

Adding them up gives \( 10 \) three-stars. Hence, the final answer is [10].
