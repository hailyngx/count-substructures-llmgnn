Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 14) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 8) (21, 25) (21, 22) (8, 21) (8, 13) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 14) (13, 18) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 0) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 11) (20, 15) (20, 16) (17, 19) (17, 18) (29, 0) (29, 22) (29, 10) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 5) (26, 3) (5, 26) (11, 23) (11, 15) (11, 22) (11, 4) (25, 21) (25, 13) (27, 21) (3, 26) (3, 28) (3, 22) (28, 1) (28, 3) (28, 9) (6, 24) (6, 18) (6, 16) (6, 12) (6, 4) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 9) (12, 6) (12, 9) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 10) (19, 15) (19, 17) (7, 23) (16, 20) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 10) (0, 23) (0, 15) (0, 29) (0, 24) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 4) (22, 21) (22, 29) (22, 11) (22, 3) (10, 29) (10, 18) (10, 16) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: 21, 26, 14, 28
- Node 21: 1, 27, 8, 25, 22
- Node 8: 21, 13, 26
- Node 13: 8, 25, 14, 18
- Node 23: 11, 7, 0
- Node 15: 20, 19, 0, 11
- Node 20: 15, 16
- Node 17: 19, 18
- Node 29: 0, 22, 10
- Node 26: 1, 8, 5, 3
- Node 5: 26
- Node 11: 23, 15, 22, 4
- Node 25: 21, 13
- Node 27: 21
- Node 3: 26, 28, 22
- Node 28: 1, 3, 9
- Node 6: 24, 18, 16, 12, 4
- Node 24: 6, 16, 0, 9
- Node 12: 6, 9
- Node 18: 13, 17, 6, 10
- Node 19: 15, 17
- Node 7: 23
- Node 16: 20, 6, 24, 10
- Node 0: 23, 15, 29, 24
- Node 14: 1, 13, 4
- Node 22: 21, 29, 11, 3
- Node 10: 29, 18, 16
- Node 9: 28, 24, 12
- Node 4: 11, 6, 14

Nodes 1, 21, 13, 26, 11, and 4 have 4 or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars formed = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 27

Therefore, there are [27] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (21, 26, 14)>
- <1, (21, 26, 28)>
- <1, (21, 14, 28)>
- <21, (1, 8, 25)>
- <21, (8, 13, 25)>
- <21, (13, 14, 18)>
- <21, (8, 13, 18)>
- <21, (13, 14, 18)>
- <21, (8, 26, 5)>
- <21, (8, 26, 3)>
- <13, (8, 25, 14)>
- <13, (25, 14, 18)>
- <26, (1, 8, 5)>
- <26, (1, 8, 3)>
- <26, (8, 5, 3)>
- <11, (23, 15, 22)>
- <4, (11, 6, 14)>
- <4, (6, 14, 13)>
- <4, (6, 14, 11)>
- <4, (6, 14, 4)>
