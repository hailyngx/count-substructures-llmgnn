Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 27) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 19) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 1) (4, 18) (4, 15) (18, 13) (18, 4) (18, 25) (26, 22) (26, 10) (24, 0) (24, 7) (6, 21) (6, 25) (6, 12) (21, 13) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 14) (28, 17) (28, 25) (16, 21) (16, 25) (2, 21) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 23) (12, 6) (12, 2) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 20) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 2) (7, 14) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 8) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 9) (15, 4) (15, 23) (15, 8) (23, 2) (23, 15) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) (27, 22) (27, 19) (5, 10) (5, 20) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 27) (25, 18) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 16) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 15) (20, 10) (20, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the unique 3-star configurations in the graph:

1. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {11, 2, 29} - <1, (11, 2, 29)>
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {1, 12, 21, 23} - <2, (1, 12, 23)>
3. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {18, 15, 16} - <4, (18, 15, 16)>
4. Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {3, 8, 14, 19, 24} - <7, (3, 8, 14)>
5. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: {0, 2, 14} - <9, (0, 2, 14)>
6. Node 10 has 3 neighbors: {5, 20, 26} - <10, (5, 20, 26)>
7. Node 13 has 3 neighbors: {18, 21, 22} - <13, (18, 21, 22)>
8. Node 14 has 5 neighbors: {7, 8, 17, 28, 29} - <14, (7, 8, 17)>
9. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {14, 19, 28, 29} - <17, (14, 19, 28)>
10. Node 18 has 4 neighbors: {4, 13, 25, 26} - <18, (4, 25, 26)>
11. Node 19 has 4 neighbors: {0, 7, 17, 27} - <19, (0, 7, 27)>
12. Node 21 has 4 neighbors: {6, 13, 16, 2} - <21, (6, 16, 2)>
13. Node 22 has 3 neighbors: {13, 26, 27} - <22, (13, 26, 27)>
14. Node 25 has 4 neighbors: {16, 18, 28, 6} - <25, (16, 18, 28)>
15. Node 28 has 4 neighbors: {14, 17, 25, 6} - <28, (14, 17, 25)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \sum_{\text{nodes with 3 or more neighbors}} \binom{n}{3} \]

\[ = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

\[ = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 \]

\[ = 49 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].
