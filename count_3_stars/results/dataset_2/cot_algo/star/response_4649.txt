Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 9) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 17) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 12) (1, 4) (1, 19) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (19, 5) (19, 1) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 17) (7, 2) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 12) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, we'll create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 14, 17
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 19
- Node 2 neighbors: 7, 11, 16, 12
- Node 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 13
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 11
- Node 5 neighbors: 3, 10, 19
- Node 6 neighbors: 4, 9
- Node 7 neighbors: 2, 17
- Node 8 neighbors: 3, 12, 15
- Node 9 neighbors: 6, 11, 13, 14, 15
- Node 10 neighbors: 5, 11, 13, 15, 16
- Node 11 neighbors: 2, 4, 9, 10
- Node 12 neighbors: 2, 8, 18
- Node 13 neighbors: 3, 9, 10
- Node 14 neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 15 neighbors: 8, 9, 10
- Node 16 neighbors: 10, 16, 17
- Node 17 neighbors: 0, 7, 16
- Node 18 neighbors: 12
- Node 19 neighbors: 1, 5

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 11, 13.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 15, 16. 
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors 9, 10, 8.

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have 3 in total. Therefore, the final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars are <9, (6, 11, 13)>, <10, (5, 15, 16)>, <15, (9, 10, 8)>.
