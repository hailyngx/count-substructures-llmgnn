Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 11) (14, 15) (14, 17) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 12) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (8, 2) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 0) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 7) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 0) (10, 9) (10, 12) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 12) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 12) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {15, 6, 7}
2: {18, 8, 7, 11}
3: {15, 11}
4: {18, 16, 13}
5: {19, 7}
6: {1, 0, 12}
7: {5, 2, 1}
8: {2}
9: {17, 10, 19}
10: {9, 12}
11: {3, 15, 2, 0}
12: {17, 10, 16, 6}
13: {4, 19, 0}
14: {15, 17}
15: {3, 1, 14, 11}
16: {18, 4, 12}
17: {9, 14, 12}
18: {2, 4, 16}
19: {5, 9, 13, 0}

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if we can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <2, (18, 8, 11)>, <2, (18, 7, 11)>, <2, (8, 7, 11)>, <2, (18, 8, 7)>.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (18, 16, 13)>.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star: <6, (1, 0, 12)>.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <11, (15, 2, 0)>, <11, (15, 2, 11)>, <11, (15, 2, 3)>, <11, (15, 0, 3)>.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <12, (17, 10, 16)>, <12, (17, 10, 6)>, <12, (17, 6, 10)>, <12, (17, 16, 10)>.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <15, (3, 1, 14)>, <15, (3, 1, 11)>, <15, (3, 14, 11)>, <15, (1, 14, 11)>.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <19, (5, 13, 0)>, <19, (5, 9, 0)>, <19, (5, 9, 13)>, <19, (13, 0, 9)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 25 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final answer is [25].
