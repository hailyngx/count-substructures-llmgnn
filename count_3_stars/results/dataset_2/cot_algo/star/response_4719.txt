Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: (6, 4, 2)
- Node 1: (5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 8)
- Node 2: (1, 3, 7, 8, 0)
- Node 3: (5, 9, 1, 2)
- Node 4: (5, 1, 7, 0)
- Node 5: (9, 1, 4, 3, 7)
- Node 6: (9, 1, 7, 0)
- Node 7: (5, 6, 4, 2)
- Node 8: (1, 2)
- Node 9: (5, 6, 3)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
Node 0 and 7 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 20 + 5*4 + 2*1 = 45 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [45], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 3, 8)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (5, 8, 2)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 2)>, <3, (9, 1, 5)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 1, 7)>, <4, (5, 1, 2)>, <4, (1, 7, 2)>, <4, (7, 2, 0)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 5)>, <7, (5, 1, 4)>, <7, (5, 1, 2)>.
