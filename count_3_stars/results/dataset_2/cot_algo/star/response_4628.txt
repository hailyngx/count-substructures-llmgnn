Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 3, 11, 8, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 11, 0, 14, 2, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 13, 0, 11, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 10, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 14, 2, 12, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {10, 13, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 12, 13, 9, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 3, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 10, 6, 0, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 1, 10, 8, 9}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 6}

We can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 13.

For these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of: 

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 88 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [88]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 12>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 10>, <0, 6, 12>, <1, 3, 10>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 10, 12>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 11>, <2, 3, 12>, <2, 3, 8>, <2, 6, 12>, <3, 10, 12>, <3, 10, 13>, <3, 12, 9>, <4, 7, 13>, <4, 7, 2>, <4, 13, 8>, <5, 6, 12>, <6, 14, 3>, <6, 14, 12>, <9, 10, 13>
