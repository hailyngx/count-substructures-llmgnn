Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 22) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 24) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 25) (22, 21) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 20) (23, 9) (10, 13) (10, 29) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 11) (26, 25) (26, 27) (29, 10) (29, 17) (29, 20) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 13) (4, 28) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 2) (27, 26) (27, 4) (27, 16) (27, 6) (16, 12) (16, 27) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 28) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 1) (6, 27) (6, 25) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 24) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 25) (5, 24) (19, 28) (19, 4) (19, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 23) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 23, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {21, 6, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 14, 19, 25}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 11, 20}
- Node 4: Neighbors {28, 27, 19, 0, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {24}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 27, 25}
- Node 7: Neighbors {12, 11, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {23, 20, 24}
- Node 10: Neighbors {13, 29}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 18, 17, 7, 28}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 16, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {10, 17, 28}
- Node 14: Neighbors {12, 2}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 24}
- Node 16: Neighbors {12, 27}
- Node 17: Neighbors {18, 29, 13, 11}
- Node 18: Neighbors {11, 17, 25}
- Node 19: Neighbors {28, 4, 2}
- Node 20: Neighbors {3, 23, 29, 9}
- Node 21: Neighbors {1, 22}
- Node 22: Neighbors {21, 23}
- Node 23: Neighbors {22, 0, 20, 9}
- Node 24: Neighbors {15, 9, 5}
- Node 25: Neighbors {18, 26, 6, 2}
- Node 26: Neighbors {25, 27}
- Node 27: Neighbors {26, 4, 16, 6}
- Node 28: Neighbors {11, 4, 19, 13}
- Node 29: Neighbors {10, 17, 20}

Next, we look for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:

- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( inom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: \( inom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 62

Therefore, the answer is [62]. Unique 3-stars found are:
