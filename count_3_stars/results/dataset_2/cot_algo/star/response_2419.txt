Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 8, 13, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 10, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 7, 11, 12, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 14, 2, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 11, 13, 0, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {13, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 11, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 9, 2, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 1, 7, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 11, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 1, 10, 4, 14, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 10, 5, 13, 2, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {9, 4, 5, 12, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 11, 4, 12}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (1, 10, 14)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 7, 12)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 11, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (10, 13, 14)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (10, 11, 14)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (5, 12, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
