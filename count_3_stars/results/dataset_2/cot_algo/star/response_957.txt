Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 8) (16, 13) (16, 25) (16, 8) (13, 16) (13, 22) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 29) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 21) (9, 17) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 27) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 14) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 28) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 1) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 28) (15, 1) (15, 7) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 4) (29, 22) (29, 19) (23, 11) (23, 4) (19, 22) (19, 29) (26, 6) (26, 27) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 24) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 4) (25, 16) (25, 21) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 0) (21, 25) (24, 2) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 28) (12, 3) (12, 24) (12, 6) (27, 14) (27, 26) (4, 20) (4, 23) (4, 3) (4, 0) (10, 9) (10, 24) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 18) (6, 13) (6, 22) (6, 26) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 21}
- Node 1: {8, 14, 15, 20, 28}
- Node 2: {5, 24, 28}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 20, 23}
- Node 5: {2, 17, 21}
- Node 6: {12, 13, 22, 26}
- Node 7: {3, 15, 24}
- Node 8: {1, 11, 16}
- Node 9: {10, 14, 17}
- Node 10: {9, 24}
- Node 11: {8, 23}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 24}
- Node 13: {6, 16, 18, 22}
- Node 14: {1, 9, 17, 18, 27}
- Node 15: {1, 7}
- Node 16: {8, 13, 25}
- Node 17: {5, 9, 14}
- Node 18: {13, 14, 28}
- Node 19: {22, 29}
- Node 20: {1, 4, 21}
- Node 21: {0, 5, 20, 25}
- Node 22: {13, 19, 29}
- Node 23: {4, 11}
- Node 24: {2, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 25: {16, 21}
- Node 26: {6, 27}
- Node 27: {14, 26}
- Node 28: {1, 2, 18}
- Node 29: {19, 22}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 14, Node 21, Node 24

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
- Node 21: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
- Node 24: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
- Total = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, 8, 14, 15>
- <1, 8, 14, 20>
- <1, 8, 14, 28>
- <1, 8, 15, 20>
- <1, 8, 15, 28>
- <1, 14, 15, 20>
- <1, 14, 15, 28>
- <4, 20, 21, 25>
- <4, 21, 25, 28>
- <4, 21, 25, 0>
- <4, 21, 25, 5>
- <24, 7, 12, 3>
- <24, 12, 3, 0>
- <24, 12, 3, 4>
- <24, 12, 6, 26>
