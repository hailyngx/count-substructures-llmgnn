Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 13, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 12}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 0, 10}
- Node 5: {13, 1, 7, 2}
- Node 6: {7, 2, 8, 13, 10, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 12, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 14}
- Node 10: {13, 7, 8, 14, 6, 4}
- Node 11: {1, 12, 8, 13, 14, 0}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 14, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 11, 10, 0, 6}
- Node 14: {9, 12, 11, 10}

Now, we can see that nodes 5, 7, 12, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars they each form:

- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - <5, 1, 7>, <5, 2, 13>, <5, 7, 12>, <5, 13, 11>
- Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - <7, 5, 12>, <7, 6, 10>, <7, 12, 5>, <7, 10, 6>
- Node 12: inom{4}{3} = 4
  - <12, 3, 7>, <12, 7, 5>, <12, 11, 14>, <12, 14, 9>
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
  - <13, 5, 11>, <13, 0, 6>, <13, 10, 14>, <13, 6, 7>, <13, 11, 0>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, 1, 7>
- <5, 2, 13>
- <5, 7, 12>
- <5, 13, 11>
- <7, 5, 12>
- <7, 6, 10>
- <7, 12, 5>
- <7, 10, 6>
- <12, 3, 7>
- <12, 7, 5>
- <12, 11, 14>
- <12, 14, 9>
- <13, 5, 11>
- <13, 0, 6>
- <13, 10, 14>
- <13, 6, 7>
- <13, 11, 0>
