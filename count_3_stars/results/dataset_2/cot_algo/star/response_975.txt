Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 9) (2, 6) (18, 4) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 12) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 1) (19, 16) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 17) (10, 7) (10, 12) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 10) (17, 8) (17, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 18}
- Node 5: {4, 11, 15, 17}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {8, 9, 10, 16}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 17}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 12, 16}
- Node 10: {7, 12}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 12: {3, 9, 10, 15}
- Node 13: {0, 6}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 11}
- Node 15: {5, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {7, 9, 15, 19}
- Node 17: {5, 8}
- Node 18: {4}
- Node 19: {16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with each of them:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 13} - 1 3-star
- Node 1: {4, 8, 14} - 1 3-star
- Node 3: {0, 12, 14} - 1 3-star
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 18} - [1]
- Node 5: {4, 11, 15, 17} - [1]
- Node 6: {0, 2, 11, 13} - 1 3-star
- Node 7: {8, 9, 10, 16} - [1]
- Node 9: {2, 7, 12, 16} - [1]
- Node 11: {5, 6, 14} - 1 3-star
- Node 12: {3, 9, 10, 15} - [1]
- Node 14: {1, 3, 11} - 1 3-star
- Node 15: {5, 12, 16} - [1]
- Node 16: {7, 9, 15, 19} - 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [7]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 3, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 8, 14>
- <3, 0, 12, 14>
- <4, 0, 1, 5>
- <5, 4, 11, 15>
- <6, 0, 2, 11>
- <7, 8, 9, 16>
