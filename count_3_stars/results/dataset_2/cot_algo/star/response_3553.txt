Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: (3), (10)
- Node 1: (6), (13)
- Node 2: (4), (10), (11), (12)
- Node 3: (0), (11), (13), (14)
- Node 4: (2), (7), (8), (9), (13)
- Node 5: (10), (12), (13)
- Node 6: (1), (8), (9), (14)
- Node 7: (4), (10), (11)
- Node 8: (4), (6), (11), (14)
- Node 9: (4), (6), (12), (14)
- Node 10: (0), (2), (5), (7), (10), (14)
- Node 11: (2), (3), (7), (8), (13)
- Node 12: (2), (5), (9), (13)
- Node 13: (1), (3), (4), (5), (11), (12)
- Node 14: (3), (6), (8), (9), (10)

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 82

Therefore, the final answer is [82], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 13)>, <4, (2, 8, 13)>, <4, (7, 8, 13)>, <4, (8, 9, 14)>, <6, (1, 8, 14)>, <6, (9, 12, 14)>, <6, (8, 9, 14)>, <10, (0, 2, 14)>, <10, (2, 5, 10)>, <10, (2, 5, 12)>, <10, (2, 5, 13)>, <10, (2, 7, 10)>, <10, (2, 7, 11)>, <10, (2, 7, 13)>, <10, (2, 10, 14)>, <10, (5, 10, 14)>, <10, (7, 10, 14)>, <10, (10, 14, 7)>, <11, (2, 7, 11)>, <13, (4, 5, 12)>, <13, (4, 5, 13)>, <13, (4, 7, 11)>, <13, (4, 11, 13)>, <13, (5, 10, 13)>, <13, (7, 11, 13)>, <13, (11, 12, 13)>, <13, (12, 9, 14)>, <14, (6, 8, 9)>, <14, (8, 9, 10)>, <14, (8, 9, 14)>, <14, (9, 12, 14)>, <14, (10, 14, 7)>, <14, (14, 6, 8)>
