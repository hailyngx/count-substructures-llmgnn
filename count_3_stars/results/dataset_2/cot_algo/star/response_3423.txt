Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 10) (14, 5) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by identifying the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {0, 7, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {10, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {0, 10, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 1, 4}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbor = {5}

Now we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <2, (4, 8, 9)>, so that's one 3-star.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (8, 9, 10)>, so that's one 3-star.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <4, (2, 3, 13)>, so that's one 3-star.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <5, (11, 13, 14)>, so that's one 3-star.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <10, (2, 3, 6)>, so that's one 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
