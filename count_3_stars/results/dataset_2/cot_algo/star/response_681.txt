Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 28) (18, 4) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 8) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 14) (25, 8) (25, 15) (25, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 24) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 24) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 15) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 29) (1, 26) (26, 29) (26, 1) (26, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 19) (17, 12) (17, 21) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 27) (11, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 24) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (13, 28) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 21) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 5) (21, 13) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 5) (8, 18) (8, 22) (8, 25) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 14, 20, 24}
- Node 1: {26, 29}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 24, 28}
- Node 4: {7, 18}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 12, 21, 27}
- Node 6: {5, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 28}
- Node 8: {18, 22, 25}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 27}
- Node 10: {5, 10, 22, 23}
- Node 11: {19}
- Node 12: {5, 13, 17}
- Node 13: {12, 14, 21, 28}
- Node 14: {0, 13, 20}
- Node 15: {25, 29}
- Node 16: {22, 23, 24, 26}
- Node 17: {12, 21}
- Node 18: {4, 8, 22, 28}
- Node 19: {2, 11}
- Node 20: {0, 14, 21}
- Node 21: {5, 13, 17, 20, 25}
- Node 22: {8, 18, 10, 16}
- Node 23: {10, 16}
- Node 24: {0, 3, 16}
- Node 25: {8, 15, 21}
- Node 26: {1, 16, 29}
- Node 27: {5, 9}
- Node 28: {3, 7, 13, 18}
- Node 29: {1, 15, 26}

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 = 59 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [59].

Unique 3-stars:
