Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 1, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 3, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 11}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 11, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 5, 11}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 11}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 4, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 4, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14

Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 15 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 1, 11)>
<6, (5, 11, 12)>
<7, (2, 5, 11)>
<10, (8, 11, 4)>
<13, (2, 4, 14)>
<14, (2, 4, 13)>
