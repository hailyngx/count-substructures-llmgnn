Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {12, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 2}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 5, 10, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 5}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 6, 7}.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 8, 9}.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 10, 14}.

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have 4 in total. So, the final number inside brackets is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
- <12, (1, 10, 14)>
