Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 13
- Node 3: 0, 11, 19
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 11, 15
- Node 5: 7, 17
- Node 6: 9, 12, 19
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9
- Node 9: 6, 8, 12
- Node 10: 15, 17
- Node 11: 3, 4, 13, 14
- Node 12: 6, 9, 18
- Node 13: 2, 11
- Node 14: 11, 16, 17
- Node 15: 4, 10, 16, 18
- Node 16: 0, 14, 15
- Node 17: 5, 10, 14
- Node 18: 12, 15
- Node 19: 3, 6

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19 (12 nodes)
- Total possible 3-stars = \( \sum_{i=1}^{12} \binom{n_i}{3} \), where \( n_i \) is the number of neighbors for each node.
- Total possible 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{2}{3} \)
- Total possible 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0
- Total possible 3-stars = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 0, 2>
- <2, 1, 4>
- <3, 0, 11>
- <5, 7, 17>
- <10, 15, 17>
- <12, 9, 6>
