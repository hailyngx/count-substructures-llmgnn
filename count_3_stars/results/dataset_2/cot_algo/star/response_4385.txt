Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: not possible (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: not possible (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: not possible (has less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 36

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
