Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 13, 14, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 8, 13, 14, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {11, 6, 1, 4}
- Node 3: {9, 13, 10}
- Node 4: {9, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {13, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 14, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 6, 1}
- Node 8: {0, 12, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 14, 3}
- Node 10: {11, 3, 6}
- Node 11: {10, 6, 12, 2}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 12, 3, 1, 0}
- Node 14: {9, 0, 6, 1, 12}

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 0, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1, 3-stars: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 2, 3-stars: There are not enough neighbors.
- Node 3, 3-stars: There are not enough neighbors.
- Node 4, 3-stars: There are not enough neighbors.
- Node 5, 3-stars: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 6, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9, 3-stars: There are not enough neighbors.
- Node 10, 3-stars: There are not enough neighbors.
- Node 11, 3-stars: There are not enough neighbors.
- Node 12, 3-stars: There are not enough neighbors.
- Node 13, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 14, 3-stars: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 63

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 13, 14)>
<1, (5, 13, 7)>
<1, (5, 13, 1)>
<1, (8, 13, 7)>
<1, (8, 13, 1)>
<1, (8, 13, 2)>
<1, (13, 3, 5)>
<1, (13, 3, 1)>
<1, (13, 0, 12)>
<1, (14, 6, 7)>
<1, (14, 6, 2)>
