Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 19) (9, 2) (9, 20) (9, 0) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 22) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 18) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 1) (28, 11) (28, 16) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 13) (4, 11) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 5) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 2) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 20) (15, 1) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 29) (20, 23) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 22) (29, 14) (21, 10) (21, 24) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 23) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 29) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 18) (8, 26) (8, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 23) (24, 21) (24, 0) (24, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 27) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 24) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 13) (22, 10) (22, 29) (23, 7) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 19) (13, 26) (13, 18) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 

Node 0: Neighbors {9, 24, 29}
Node 1: Neighbors {12, 20, 4, 15}
Node 2: Neighbors {9, 11, 14, 16}
Node 3: Neighbors {16, 19}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 11, 14, 27, 5}
Node 5: Neighbors {4, 27}
Node 6: Neighbors {19}
Node 7: Neighbors {11, 18, 23}
Node 8: Neighbors {17, 26}
Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 20}
Node 10: Neighbors {21, 22, 18}
Node 11: Neighbors {9, 7, 28, 4, 2}
Node 12: Neighbors {1, 17, 14}
Node 13: Neighbors {18, 26}
Node 14: Neighbors {12, 4, 29, 2}
Node 15: Neighbors {1}
Node 16: Neighbors {2, 3, 28}
Node 17: Neighbors {12, 8, 18}
Node 18: Neighbors {10, 7, 17, 24, 13}
Node 19: Neighbors {6, 3, 23}
Node 20: Neighbors {9, 1, 29, 23}
Node 21: Neighbors {10, 24}
Node 22: Neighbors {10, 29}
Node 23: Neighbors {7, 20, 25, 19}
Node 24: Neighbors {0, 21, 18}
Node 25: Neighbors {26, 27, 23}
Node 26: Neighbors {8, 25, 13}
Node 27: Neighbors {4, 25, 5}
Node 28: Neighbors {11, 16}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 45

Therefore, there are [45] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (12, 20, 4)>
<2, (9, 11, 14)>
<4, (1, 11, 27)>
<9, (0, 2, 20)>
<10, (21, 22, 18)>
<11, (9, 7, 28)>
<18, (10, 7, 17)>
<20, (9, 1, 29)>
<23, (7, 20, 25)>
<24, (0, 21, 18)>
<26, (8, 25, 13)>
<27, (4, 25, 5)>
<29, (10, 22, 14)>
