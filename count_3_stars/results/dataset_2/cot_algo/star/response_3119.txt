Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 8) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 2) (27, 13) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 7) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 21) (19, 3) (19, 0) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 23) (22, 19) (22, 17) (13, 27) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 23) (17, 6) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 15) (20, 17) (20, 29) (24, 26) (24, 18) (24, 23) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 25) (8, 3) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 14) (29, 20) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 18) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 4) (23, 26) (23, 13) (23, 24) (23, 16) (7, 28) (7, 29) (7, 5) (0, 19) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 10) (2, 27) (2, 1) (14, 15) (21, 19) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 1) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 23) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 4) (18, 24) (18, 29) (18, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0 has degree 1
- Node 1 has degree 5
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 1
- Node 10 has degree 2
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 1
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 5
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 5
- Node 20 has degree 2
- Node 21 has degree 1
- Node 22 has degree 2
- Node 23 has degree 4
- Node 24 has degree 3
- Node 25 has degree 3
- Node 26 has degree 4
- Node 27 has degree 3
- Node 28 has degree 4
- Node 29 has degree 5

Based on the degrees of the nodes, we can identify the nodes forming a 3-star:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 22, and 28: <17, (6, 22, 28)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 21, and 26: <19, (0, 21, 26)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 23, and 24: <26, (13, 23, 24)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 11, and 17: <28, (7, 11, 17)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 18, and 20: <29, (5, 18, 20)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
