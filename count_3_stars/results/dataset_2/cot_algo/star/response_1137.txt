Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 4) (4, 0) (4, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

```
       5----8----2
      /|   /|   /|
     1 |  6 |  10|
     | 9---7---3 |
     |/    |/    |/
    11----0----12
     |    |    |
     |   4|    |
     13---14---   (nodes)
```

For each node, we find its neighbors:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 7, 10, 11, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 14, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {8, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 1, 11, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 0, 3, 10, 14, 13}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 2, 10, 3}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {9, 8, 0, 7, 1, 13}
- Node 11: {5, 0, 13, 12}
- Node 12: {9, 1, 3, 11}
- Node 13: {7, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {7, 1, 4}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors --> [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors --> [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors --> [inom{6}{3}] = 20

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 20 = 50

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 11)>
<0, (5, 7, 11)>
<0, (5, 10, 11)>
<0, (9, 7, 10)>
<1, (5, 11, 12)>
<1, (6, 7, 10)>
<7, (6, 8, 10)>
<7, (6, 3, 12)>
<7, (10, 11, 13)>
<7, (10, 1, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].
