Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 9) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 17) (9, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 6) (19, 10) (4, 2) (4, 1) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 11) (15, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (10, 19) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 12, 16}
- Node 2: {4, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 3: {12, 17}
- Node 4: {1, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 19}
- Node 7: {13, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {11, 17}
- Node 10: {19}
- Node 11: {9, 13, 15}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 8, 15}
- Node 13: {5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 13, 17}
- Node 15: {2, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 16: {1, 2, 17}
- Node 17: {3, 9, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 18: {2, 15, 17}
- Node 19: {6, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of unique 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 4, 12, 16>, <2, 4, 15, 18>, <5, 6, 13>, <6, 8, 12>, <13, 7, 14>, <15, 11, 12>, <17, 3, 9, 16>, <17, 14, 18>, <17, 16, 2>, <17, 18, 15>.
