Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 13) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, which could potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate them:

1. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {6, 2, 8, 12}. We can form 1 unique 3-star with Node 5: <5, (6, 2, 8)>.
2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {4, 2, 10, 13}. We can form 1 unique 3-star with Node 9: <9, (4, 2, 10)>.
3. Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {5, 11, 7, 13, 14}. We can form 5 unique 3-stars with Node 12: <12, (5, 11, 7)>, <12, (5, 13, 14)>, <12, (11, 7, 14)>, <12, (7, 13, 14)>, <12, (5, 7, 14)>.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 5 = 7, so the final answer is [7].
