Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 7, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +10 = 60 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [60].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>
