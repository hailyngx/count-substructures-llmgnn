Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 is the center of the 3-star <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 is the center of the 3-star <5, (0, 1, 4)> and <5, (6, 7, 4)>
- Node 6 is the center of the 3-star <6, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 7 is the center of the 3-star <7, (1, 2, 5)> and <7, (3, 5, 8)>

Since each 3-star is listed only once, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
