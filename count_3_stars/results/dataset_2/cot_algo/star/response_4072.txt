Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 8) (15, 26) (15, 5) (1, 21) (1, 29) (21, 1) (21, 9) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 7) (22, 25) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 0) (5, 28) (9, 21) (9, 5) (9, 7) (7, 22) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 8) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 4) (6, 0) (28, 5) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 23) (17, 11) (29, 1) (29, 10) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 26) (26, 3) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 0) (11, 3) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 2) (23, 28) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 0) (25, 22) (25, 16) (25, 2) (27, 16) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 20) (14, 18) (14, 11) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 28) (8, 20) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 19) (20, 24) (20, 8) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 27) (10, 29) (10, 2) (2, 11) (2, 25) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 19, 26, 28
- Node 1: 9, 21, 29
- Node 2: 10, 11, 25
- Node 3: 8, 11, 26
- Node 4: 6, 13, 18, 19
- Node 5: 0, 9, 15, 24, 28
- Node 6: 0, 4, 24, 28
- Node 7: 9, 12, 22
- Node 8: 3, 12, 20, 28
- Node 9: 1, 5, 7, 21
- Node 10: 2, 29
- Node 11: 2, 3, 14, 17
- Node 12: 7, 8, 13
- Node 13: 4, 12, 26
- Node 14: 11, 18
- Node 15: 5, 26
- Node 16: 2, 25, 27
- Node 17: 11
- Node 18: 4, 14, 19, 22
- Node 19: 0, 4, 18
- Node 20: 8, 24
- Node 21: 1, 9
- Node 22: 7, 18, 25
- Node 23: 28
- Node 24: 5, 6, 20
- Node 25: 2, 16, 22
- Node 26: 3, 13, 15
- Node 27: 16
- Node 28: 0, 6, 8, 23, 5
- Node 29: 1, 10

Then, identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 5, 8, and 28 have exactly 5 neighbors.
- Nodes 4, 9, 18, and 22 have exactly 4 neighbors.
- Nodes 6, 12, and 25 have exactly 3 neighbors.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-star graphs:
- For nodes 0, 5, 8, and 28, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each, giving a total of \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 4, 9, 18, and 22, we have 1 3-star each, giving a total of \( 4 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 6, 12, and 25, since they have exactly 3 neighbors, they do not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 40 + 4 = 44 \). Thus, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 28)>, <5, (0, 9, 24)>, <8, (3, 12, 28)>, <28, (0, 5, 8)>.
