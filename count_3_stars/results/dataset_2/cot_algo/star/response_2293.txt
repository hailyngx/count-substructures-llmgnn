Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: 5, 4, 0
2: 5, 7, 0, 3
3: 5, 9, 6, 8, 2
4: 7, 1, 6
5: 9, 2, 1, 3
6: 9, 4, 7, 3, 8
7: 9, 4, 0, 6, 2
8: 9, 6, 3
9: 5, 6, 8, 7, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that could form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 3, 6, 9, 2, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
<5, (1, 3, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (3, 2, 9)>

For node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<3, (9, 6, 2)>
<3, (9, 8, 2)>
<3, (5, 8, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 2)>
<3, (6, 8, 2)>

For node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 3)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 3, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 3, 9)>

For node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 7, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 3, 8)>
<9, (6, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>

For node 2: 1 3-star
<2, (5, 7, 0)>

For node 7: 1 3-star
<7, (9, 4, 0)>

For node 8: 0 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 36
Therefore, the final answer is [36].
