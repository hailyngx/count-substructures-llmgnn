Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {6, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 3, 5}
- Node 2: {11, 3, 8, 12, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 8, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 1, 2}
- Node 6: {0, 9, 14, 12, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 10, 1, 11}
- Node 8: {4, 2}
- Node 9: {6, 14, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 0, 1, 11}
- Node 11: {7, 10, 14, 2}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 14, 2}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 0, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 11, 12, 13}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 70 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 3, 10>
- <0, 3, 13>
- <0, 6, 14>
- <0, 6, 4>
- <1, 7, 11>
- <1, 7, 4>
- <1, 7, 10>
- <2, 11, 14>
- <2, 11, 7>
- <2, 12, 14>
- <2, 12, 6>
- <4, 6, 13>
- <5, 1, 7>
- <5, 2, 12>
- <5, 2, 11>
- <5, 4, 7>
- <6, 0, 13>
- <6, 4, 7>
- <6, 9, 14>
- <6, 12, 14>
- <10, 7, 11>
