Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 10) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (5, 8) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 13) (11, 1) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 16) (14, 3) (16, 9) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 15) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 2, 4, 15
- Node 1: 7, 11, 10, 19
- Node 2: 18, 0
- Node 3: 19, 14, 16
- Node 4: 0, 15, 17
- Node 5: 8
- Node 6: 9, 18, 0
- Node 7: 13, 1
- Node 8: 9, 5, 19
- Node 9: 6, 8, 17, 16, 19
- Node 10: 12, 1, 16
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 10
- Node 13: 18, 7, 19
- Node 14: 3
- Node 15: 18, 4, 0
- Node 16: 9, 17, 3, 10
- Node 17: 9, 18, 4, 16
- Node 18: 6, 2, 15, 17, 13
- Node 19: 9, 8, 1, 3, 13

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of 46 3-stars, so the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 15>
- <0, 4, 15>
- <0, 6, 15>
- <0, 15, 18>
- <1, 7, 10>
- <1, 7, 19>
- <1, 10, 19>
- <1, 11, 19>
- <4, 0, 15>
- <8, 5, 19>
- <9, 6, 18>
- <9, 8, 17>
- <9, 8, 19>
- <9, 16, 17>
- <9, 16, 19>
- <9, 17, 18>
- <9, 19, 13>
- <10, 1, 16>
- <13, 7, 18>
- <13, 7, 19>
- <16, 3, 10>
- <16, 3, 17>
- <16, 3, 19>
- <16, 9, 17>
- <17, 4, 16>
- <17, 9, 16>
- <18, 13, 19>
- <19, 1, 10>
- <19, 1, 13>
- <19, 1, 7>
