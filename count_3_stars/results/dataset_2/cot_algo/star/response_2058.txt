Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 9, 3, 1, 10
Node 1: 7, 3, 11, 2, 0, 14
Node 2: 8, 1, 10, 11, 6
Node 3: 5, 1, 0, 10, 13
Node 4: 7, 8, 14, 6
Node 5: 9, 3
Node 6: 4, 2
Node 7: 9, 4, 12, 1
Node 8: 4, 2, 14, 12
Node 9: 5, 7, 13, 0
Node 10: 3, 0, 12, 2
Node 11: 1, 14, 12, 2
Node 12: 7, 8, 10, 11, 14
Node 13: 9, 3
Node 14: 4, 1, 8, 11, 12

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by calculating the number of 3-star formations around each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: No 3-star formation
Node 6: No 3-star formation
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: No 3-star formation
Node 9: No 3-star formation
Node 10: No 3-star formation
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: No 3-star formation
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

By summing up the 3-star formations around each node, we get a total of 72 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (7, 11, 14)>, <1, (7, 14, 12)>, <1, (11, 2, 14)>, <1, (3, 0, 10)>, <2, (8, 12, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 14)>, <7, (4, 8, 14)>, <11, (7, 12, 14)>, <12, (8, 10, 14)>.
