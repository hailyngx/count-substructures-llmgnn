Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 11}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 7: {6, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 5, 6}
- Node 13: {3, 4}
- Node 14: {0, 3, 5, 9, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, which are potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 6 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each potential center:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 84

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [84].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (5, 12, 14)>
<1, (6, 8, 10)>
<3, (6, 9, 14)>
<6, (2, 3, 12)>
<10, (1, 8, 11)>
<11, (0, 2, 14)>
<12, (1, 5, 6)>
<14, (3, 9, 11)>
