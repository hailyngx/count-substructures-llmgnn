Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 19) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 0) (15, 10) (0, 9) (0, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 0) (18, 9) (18, 17) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 19) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 19) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 16}
- Node 1: {5, 7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9, 16}
- Node 3: {8, 10, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 4: {16, 17}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {8, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 11}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 18}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 13, 15}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 7}
- Node 12: {1, 5, 6, 19}
- Node 13: {3, 10, 19}
- Node 14: {5, 6}
- Node 15: {10}
- Node 16: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 17: {4, 18, 19}
- Node 18: {9, 17}
- Node 19: {3, 12, 13, 17}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 42 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 10, 12)>, <2, (5, 8, 16)>, <3, (8, 10, 13)>, <5, (1, 2, 14)>, <6, (8, 12, 14)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <10, (1, 3, 13)>, <11, (1, 3, 7)>, <12, (1, 5, 6)>, <13, (3, 10, 19)>, <16, (2, 4, 16)>, <17, (4, 18, 19)>
