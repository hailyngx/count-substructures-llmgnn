Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 5, 1, 6
- Node 1: 9, 7, 3, 6, 0, 8
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 9, 4, 1
- Node 4: 7, 8, 3, 2
- Node 5: 6, 8, 0, 7
- Node 6: 5, 1, 8, 0
- Node 7: 5, 9, 4, 2, 1
- Node 8: 5, 9, 4, 1, 6
- Node 9: 8, 3, 1, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: 6 neighbors (3-stars can be formed)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (3-stars can be formed)
- Node 5: 4 neighbors (3-stars can be formed)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (3-stars can be formed)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (3-stars can be formed)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (3-stars can be formed)

For nodes with 6, 5, and 4 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars as:

- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52

Thus, the final answer is [52] and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <4, (2, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
