Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 11) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 5, 9, 14
2. Node 1: Neighbors are 7, 8, 9, 12
3. Node 2: Neighbors are 5, 6, 12, 13
4. Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 9, 11, 13
5. Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 5, 10, 12
6. Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4
7. Node 6: Neighbors are 2, 3, 8, 9, 14
8. Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 11
9. Node 8: Neighbors are 1, 6, 10, 12
10. Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 11
11. Node 10: Neighbors are 4, 8, 9, 14
12. Node 11: Neighbors are 3, 7, 9, 13
13. Node 12: Neighbors are 2, 4, 8, 1
14. Node 13: Neighbors are 2, 3, 11, 14
15. Node 14: Neighbors are 0, 6, 10, 13

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 38 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (2, 13, 14)>
<6, (3, 9, 14)>
<6, (8, 9, 14)>
<6, (9, 10, 14)>
<6, (9, 11, 13)>
<9, (0, 10, 14)>
<9, (1, 3, 11)>
<9, (1, 8, 12)>
<10, (4, 8, 12)>
<12, (1, 4, 8)>
