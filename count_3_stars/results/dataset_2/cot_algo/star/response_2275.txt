Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 3, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 6, 3, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 9, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 8, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 7, 1, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 0, 6, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 4, 1, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 4, 2}

Now, let's look at the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 5: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1: 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (1, 4, 8)>, 
<1, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<4, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (1, 4, 6)>, 
<8, (5, 1, 2)>, 
<9, (5, 4, 6)>, 
<6, (9, 1, 2)>.
