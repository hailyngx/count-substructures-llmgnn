Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 27) (17, 27) (17, 26) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 15) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 25) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 16) (23, 9) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 0) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 15) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 6) (15, 21) (15, 12) (15, 20) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 12) (20, 15) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 13) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 25) (3, 21) (3, 26) (9, 23) (9, 12) (22, 10) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 19) (16, 23) (16, 29) (5, 21) (5, 26) (5, 24) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 3) (26, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 13) (29, 16) (29, 24) (19, 11) (19, 0) (6, 14) (6, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 22) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 13) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 24) (25, 8) (25, 28) (24, 5) (24, 29) (24, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 18, 19}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 11, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {10, 13, 18, 28}
- Node 3: Neighbors {21, 26}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 18}
- Node 5: Neighbors {21, 24, 26}
- Node 6: Neighbors {14, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 12, 21}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 10, 23, 25}
- Node 9: Neighbors {12, 23}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 8, 22}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 13, 19, 28}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 9, 15, 20}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 2, 11, 24, 27}
- Node 14: Neighbors {6, 27}
- Node 15: Neighbors {12, 20, 21}
- Node 16: Neighbors {23, 29}
- Node 17: Neighbors {26, 27}
- Node 18: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 20}
- Node 19: Neighbors {0, 11}
- Node 20: Neighbors {12, 15, 18, 21}
- Node 21: Neighbors {3, 5, 7, 15, 20}
- Node 22: Neighbors {10}
- Node 23: Neighbors {8, 9, 16, 26}
- Node 24: Neighbors {5, 13, 29}
- Node 25: Neighbors {8, 28}
- Node 26: Neighbors {3, 5, 17, 23}
- Node 27: Neighbors {13, 14, 17}
- Node 28: Neighbors {2, 11, 25}
- Node 29: Neighbors {16, 24}


Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, we'll apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes to find the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed as it has < 3 neighbors
- Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed as it has < 3 neighbors
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: No 3-stars can be formed as it has < 3 neighbors
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: No 3-stars can be formed as it has < 3 neighbors
- Node 28: No 3-stars can be formed as it has < 3 neighbors
- Node 29: No 3-stars can be formed as it has < 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 37

Therefore, the final answer is [37].
