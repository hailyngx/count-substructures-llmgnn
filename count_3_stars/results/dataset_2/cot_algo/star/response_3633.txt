Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 8}
Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 9}
Node 4: {8, 9}
Node 5: {1, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
Node 8: {0, 2, 4}
Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars formed:

Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 2: 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 7: 1 3-star
Node 9: 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
