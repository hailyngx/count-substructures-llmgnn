Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (17, 0) (17, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 0) (16, 15) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (6, 17) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (19, 13) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the set of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 13, 16, 17, 8}
- Node 1: {7, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 12, 19, 3, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 12, 2, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {13, 2}
- Node 6: {17, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {0, 15, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {15, 18, 9}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 8}
- Node 12: {2, 3}
- Node 13: {5, 19, 0, 18}
- Node 14: {4, 2, 8}
- Node 15: {10, 8, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 6}
- Node 18: {13, 10}
- Node 19: {13, 2}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19
- \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) three stars for each of these nodes.

- Total number of 3-stars = \(14 \times 1 = 14\)

So, the final answer is [14].

List of unique 3-stars found:
<0, (7, 13, 16)>
<2, (5, 12, 19)>
<3, (7, 12, 2)>
<4, (7, 9, 14)>
<8, (0, 15, 11)>
<9, (4, 10, 11)>
<11, (1, 9, 8)>
<12, (2, 3, 0)>
<13, (5, 19, 0)>
<14, (4, 2, 8)>
<15, (10, 8, 16)>
<17, (0, 6, 3)>
<18, (13, 10, 0)>
<19, (5, 2, 13)>
