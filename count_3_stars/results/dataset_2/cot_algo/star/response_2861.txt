Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 17) (9, 11) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 14) (13, 6) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (19, 4) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 6) (18, 16) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually to better understand its structure:

```
    17 -- 5           4 -- 2
    |     |           |       
    8 -- 11 -- 16 -- 0 -- 12
    |         |     |    | 
    7 -- 15 -- 1 -- 10    19
     \   |     |     |
       14 -- 13 -- 6
           |     |
           3 -- 18
```

Now, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 16, 18, 12, 19
Node 1: 15, 10, 14
Node 2: 15, 4
Node 3: 16, 8, 14, 4
Node 4: 2, 19, 3
Node 5: 17
Node 6: 13, 7
Node 7: 15, 6, 17, 14
Node 8: 11, 3, 10, 17, 9
Node 9: 11
Node 10: 1, 8, 6
Node 11: 16, 9, 8
Node 12: 0, 19
Node 13: 14, 6
Node 14: 15, 13, 3, 7, 1
Node 15: 7, 1, 19, 2
Node 16: 11, 0, 18, 3
Node 17: 8, 7, 5
Node 18: 16, 0
Node 19: 15, 0, 12, 4

Now, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 14, 15, and 19 have 3 or more neighbors, meaning they can form 3-stars. Let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed:

\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 43 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [43].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 16, 18>
<1, 15, 19>
<1, 14, 15>
<1, 10, 15>
<3, 14, 15>
<3, 4, 19>
<3, 14, 7>
<7, 14, 15>
<8, 11, 16>
<8, 3, 16>
