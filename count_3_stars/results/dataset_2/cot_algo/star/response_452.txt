Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors:

- Node 0 and Node 2 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 4 and Node 7 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 8 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each.

For nodes with 5 neighbors (Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 7), we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For these nodes, the total number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) each.

So, for Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, and Node 7, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 \times 10 = 40 \).

Thus, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
