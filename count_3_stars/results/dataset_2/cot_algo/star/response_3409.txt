Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 15) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 18) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 10) (15, 16) (15, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 4) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 10) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 18) (18, 13) (18, 10) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 14) 

Response:
Given the provided information, we can first construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: {6, 10, 15}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 17}
- Node 6: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 11, 17}
- Node 8: {9, 13}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 11, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 6, 18}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 13, 16, 17}
- Node 12: {4}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 16}
- Node 16: {11, 15}
- Node 17: {5, 7}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:
From the calculated neighbor sets, we find that nodes 11 and 13 have more than 3 neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

For node 11:
- <11, (9, 13, 17)>
- <11, (13, 16, 17)>

For node 13:
- <13, (9, 11, 19)>
- <13, (11, 16, 17)>
- <13, (11, 18, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
