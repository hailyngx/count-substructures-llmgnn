Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors are 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: neighbors are 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: neighbors are 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: neighbors are 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: neighbors are 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: neighbors are 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 6: neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: neighbors are 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9: neighbors are 3, 4, 5, 7

Next, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 3, 5, 8, 9.

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 28 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
