Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <4, (1, 2, 7)>
- <5, (1, 2, 3)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 6, 0)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
