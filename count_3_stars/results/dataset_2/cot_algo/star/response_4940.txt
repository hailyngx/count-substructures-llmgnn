Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 7) (26, 12) (5, 9) (5, 17) (13, 25) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 6) (22, 23) (22, 25) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 16) (4, 23) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (21, 28) (21, 11) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 7) (28, 2) (3, 11) (11, 21) (11, 3) (11, 17) (0, 28) (0, 29) (7, 26) (7, 28) (1, 22) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 29) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 10) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 18) (10, 20) (27, 9) (27, 4) (12, 26) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 26) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 19) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 29) (2, 4) (2, 28) (2, 16) (2, 17) (25, 13) (25, 22) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 17) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 2) (17, 16) (19, 1) (19, 24) 

Response:
The node degree of each node is as follows:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 4
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 3
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 5
- Node 17: 4
- Node 18: 3
- Node 19: 2
- Node 20: 3
- Node 21: 2
- Node 22: 3
- Node 23: 3
- Node 24: 3
- Node 25: 2
- Node 26: 5
- Node 27: 2
- Node 28: 4
- Node 29: 5

For the 3-star counting:
- Node 16, Node 26, and Node 29 have 5 neighbors each, so each of them contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 6, Node 13, and Node 17 have 4 neighbors each, so each of them contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Adding them up: 
  \( (10 \times 3) + (4 \times 5) = 30 + 20 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<16, 26, 29>
<1, 15, 16>
<1, 16, 17>
<1, 19, 24>
<1, 22, 25>
<4, 16, 23>
<4, 16, 17>
<6, 13, 15>
<6, 13, 29>
<6, 15, 29>
<13, 15, 29>
<16, 17, 23>
<16, 17, 2>
<26, 27, 9>
<26, 4, 27>
<26, 8, 12>
<26, 8, 2>
<26, 12, 6>
<29, 0, 15>
<29, 15, 20>
<29, 18, 20>
