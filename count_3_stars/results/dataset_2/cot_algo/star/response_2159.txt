Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 7, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 2, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8, 5, 1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {6, 9, 5, 2, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 9, 8, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 3, 2, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 3, 2, 8, 4}

Now, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and find the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 8, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <5, (6, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 2)>
