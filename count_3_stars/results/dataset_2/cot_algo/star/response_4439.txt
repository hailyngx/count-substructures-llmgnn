Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first list out the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 13, 14, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 11, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {9, 11, 13, 14, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {11, 4, 0, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 10, 13, 3}
- Node 8: {11, 13, 4, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 14, 3}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {3, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 12: {4, 14, 3, 6}
- Node 13: {10, 8, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 14: {9, 0, 3, 12, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \text{inom}{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 also has 5 neighbors, thus it forms \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us \( [20 + 10] = [30] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (9, 13, 14)>
- <14, (9, 2, 3)>
