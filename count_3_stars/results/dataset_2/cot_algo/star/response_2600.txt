Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 27) (6, 20) (9, 29) (9, 19) (22, 23) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 0) (0, 23) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 13) (28, 6) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 7) (28, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 4) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 25) (24, 21) (18, 23) (18, 26) (18, 1) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 12) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 7) (10, 0) (10, 28) (10, 2) (10, 7) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 25) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 4) (7, 28) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 1) (21, 24) (21, 13) (4, 2) (4, 3) (25, 24) (25, 5) (25, 19) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (16, 29) (27, 6) (27, 24) (27, 3) (27, 8) (12, 28) (12, 29) (17, 15) (11, 5) (8, 1) (8, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 2, 10, 14, 20, 23
Node 1: 5, 13, 18
Node 2: 4, 10, 15, 0
Node 3: 4, 6, 27
Node 4: 2, 3
Node 5: 1, 7, 11, 25, 26
Node 6: 3, 20, 27, 28
Node 7: 5, 7, 10, 14, 28
Node 8: 1, 27
Node 9: 12, 16, 19, 29
Node 10: 0, 2, 7, 28
Node 11: 5
Node 12: 9, 29
Node 13: 1, 21
Node 14: 0, 7
Node 15: 2, 17, 19
Node 16: 9
Node 17: 15
Node 18: 1, 23, 26
Node 19: 9, 15, 19, 25
Node 20: 0, 6, 13
Node 21: 13, 24
Node 22: 23, 28
Node 23: 0, 18, 22
Node 24: 21, 25, 26, 27
Node 25: 5, 19, 24
Node 26: 5, 18, 24
Node 27: 3, 6, 8, 24
Node 28: 6, 7, 10, 12, 22
Node 29: 9, 12, 16

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: none
Nodes with 4 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 19, 24, 26, 27, 28

For each of these nodes with 4 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 7: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 19: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 24: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 26: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 27: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 28: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 55

So the final number of 3-stars is [55].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 2, 10>, <0, 2, 14>, <0, 2, 20>, <0, 2, 23>, <0, 5, 25>, <0, 5, 26>, <0, 7, 14>, <0, 7, 28>, <0, 10, 20>, <0, 10, 23>, <0, 14, 7>, <0, 20, 6>, <0, 20, 13>, <2, 4, 10>, <2, 4, 15>, <2, 10, 7>, <2, 15, 17>, <5, 7, 10>, <5, 7, 25>, <5, 7, 26>, <5, 10, 7>, <5, 11, 25>, <5, 25, 19>, <7, 10, 28>, <9, 12, 29>, <19, 15, 17>, <24, 25, 26>, <24, 25, 27>, <24, 25, 5>, <24, 26, 18>
