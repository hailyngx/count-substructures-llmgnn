Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 26) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 1) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 14) (29, 24) (29, 3) (3, 29) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 13) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 18) (14, 29) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 26) (8, 13) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 9) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 22) (0, 3) (20, 7) (20, 23) (20, 28) (7, 20) (12, 10) (26, 27) (26, 2) (26, 17) (26, 28) (26, 4) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 4) (21, 19) (21, 5) (21, 22) (5, 14) (5, 21) (5, 19) (19, 21) (19, 5) (4, 14) (4, 26) (4, 28) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 1) (6, 18) (11, 14) (11, 18) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 1) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 17) (16, 22) (24, 15) (24, 29) (22, 25) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 16) (18, 27) (18, 25) (18, 6) (18, 11) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {2, 6, 23}
2: {1, 29, 26}
3: {0, 13, 25, 29}
4: {14, 26, 28}
5: {14, 19, 21}
6: {1, 18}
7: {20}
8: {13}
9: {13}
10: {12, 17, 22}
11: {14, 18}
12: {10}
13: {3, 8, 9}
14: {4, 5, 11, 17, 29}
15: {16, 23, 24, 27}
16: {15, 17, 22, 25, 29}
17: {10, 14, 16, 26}
18: {6, 11, 25, 27}
19: {5, 21}
20: {7, 23, 28}
21: {5, 19, 22}
22: {10, 16, 21, 25}
23: {1, 15, 20}
24: {15, 29}
25: {3, 16, 18, 22}
26: {2, 17, 27, 28, 4}
27: {15, 18, 26}
28: {4, 20, 26}
29: {2, 14, 16, 24}

Now, we will identify which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars from the eligible nodes, we get a total of 44 3-stars: [44].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<15, (16, 23, 27)>
