Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 17) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) (0, 4) (14, 12) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 18) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 3) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 12) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (2, 1) (2, 17) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 9, 13, 11, 15, 2
- Node 2: 1, 17
- Node 3: 4, 18
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 11, 19, 16
- Node 6: 7, 9, 10
- Node 7: 6, 17
- Node 8: 13, 10, 15
- Node 9: 6, 17, 1, 19
- Node 10: 6, 8, 11
- Node 11: 10, 1, 5, 17, 15
- Node 12: 14, 15, 16
- Node 13: 8, 1, 18
- Node 14: 12
- Node 15: 8, 11, 1, 12
- Node 16: 5, 18, 12
- Node 17: 7, 9, 11, 2
- Node 18: 13, 19, 16, 3
- Node 19: 9, 5, 18

From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 1, 9, 11, 15, and 18 have 5 or more neighbors, which means we can form 3-stars with those nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (9, 13, 11)>
- <1, (9, 13, 15)>
- <1, (9, 11, 15)>
- <1, (13, 11, 15)>
- <9, (6, 10, 19)>
