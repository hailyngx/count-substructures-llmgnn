This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 22) (21, 20) (21, 29) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 22) (23, 26) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 15) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 24) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 18) (3, 7) (3, 22) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (26, 23) (26, 25) (26, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 25) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 27) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 24) (18, 20) (18, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 22) (25, 26) (25, 11) (25, 28) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 19) (19, 14) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 24) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 24) (24, 17) (24, 14) (24, 29) (24, 10) (24, 28) (27, 6) (27, 10) (27, 28) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 6) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 3) (22, 12) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 7, 11
Node 1 neighbors: 11, 22
Node 2 neighbors: 8, 11, 13
Node 3 neighbors: 7, 22
Node 4 neighbors: 5, 16, 19
Node 5 neighbors: 4, 13, 15
Node 6 neighbors: 10, 14, 15, 26, 27
Node 7 neighbors: 0, 3, 9, 14
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 9, 22
Node 9 neighbors: 7, 8, 12
Node 10 neighbors: 6, 18, 24, 27
Node 11 neighbors: 1, 2, 0, 25
Node 12 neighbors: 9, 13, 22
Node 13 neighbors: 2, 5, 12, 15
Node 14 neighbors: 7, 6, 19, 24
Node 15 neighbors: 5, 6, 13
Node 16 neighbors: 4, 17
Node 17 neighbors: 16, 20, 24
Node 18 neighbors: 10, 20
Node 19 neighbors: 4, 14
Node 20 neighbors: 17, 18, 21
Node 21 neighbors: 20, 29
Node 22 neighbors: 1, 8, 3, 12
Node 23 neighbors: 26, 25
Node 24 neighbors: 17, 14, 10, 28, 29
Node 25 neighbors: 23, 26, 11, 28
Node 26 neighbors: 23, 25, 6
Node 27 neighbors: 10, 6, 28
Node 28 neighbors: 25, 24, 27
Node 29 neighbors: 21, 24

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each
For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: inom{n}{3}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 * 18 = 18
For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 17 choose 3 + 5 choose 3 + 5 choose 3 + 4 choose 3 + 5 choose 3 + 4 choose 3 + 5 choose 3 + 7 choose 3 + 4 choose 3 + 7 choose 3 + 4 choose 3 + 5 choose 3 + 5 choose 3 + 5 choose 3 + 7 choose 3 + 17 choose 3 + 5 choose 3 = 238

Adding them up: 18 + 238 = 256

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [256].

Some unique 3-stars are:
<0, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 22>
<5, 13, 15>
<6, 14, 24>
<10, 24, 27>
<11, 25, 28>
