Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 12}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {13}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {7, 9, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {6, 10, 12, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 5, 12, 13

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Total 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 20 + 35 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 8, 10)>
- <5, (7, 9, 10)>
- <12, (1, 9, 14)>
- <13, (3, 9, 11)>
- <13, (6, 8, 14)>
