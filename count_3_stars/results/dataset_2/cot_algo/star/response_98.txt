Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {9, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 3}
- Node 8: {1, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 2, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 6, 13}

Based on the neighbor sets, let's identify potential 3-stars:

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 9.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 12.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving node 13.

Adding up these potential 3-stars gives a total of 30 3-stars in this graph: [30]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>,
<12, (0, 1, 10)>, <12, (0, 1, 11)>, <12, (0, 1, 13)>, <12, (0, 10, 11)>, <12, (0, 10, 13)>, <12, (0, 11, 13)>, <12, (1, 10, 11)>, <12, (1, 10, 13)>, <12, (1, 11, 13)>, <12, (10, 11, 13)>,
<13, (0, 1, 2)>, <13, (0, 1, 14)>, <13, (0, 2, 14)>, <13, (0, 12, 14)>, <13, (1, 2, 14)>, <13, (1, 12, 14)>, <13, (2, 12, 14)>,
with a total count of 21 unique 3-stars.
