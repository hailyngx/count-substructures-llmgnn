Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (6, 8) (6, 14) (16, 3) (16, 7) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 9) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

For each node, let's find its neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 7, 18, 19}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 18}
- Node 3: {1, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 9, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 5: {4, 14}
- Node 6: {8, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 11, 16, 18}
- Node 8: {6, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 9, 15, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {4, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {10, 11}
- Node 13: {3, 17}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 6, 18}
- Node 15: {3, 9}
- Node 16: {3, 7}
- Node 17: {9, 13}
- Node 18: {0, 2, 7, 14}
- Node 19: {0, 4, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [48].

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (5, 14, 19)>, <4, (7, 14, 19)>, <4, (9, 14, 19)>, <4, (10, 14, 19)>, <4, (7, 9, 14)>,
<7, (0, 11, 18)>, <7, (11, 12, 18)>, <7, (11, 0, 18)>, <7, (11, 1, 18)>, <7, (0, 11, 1)>,
<9, (4, 17, 19)>, <9, (4, 9, 19)>, <9, (4, 15, 19)>, <9, (4, 9, 15)>, <9, (4, 9, 17)>,
<14, (5, 6, 18)>, <14, (5, 14, 18)>, <14, (6, 8, 18)>, <14, (6, 14, 18)>, <14, (4, 6, 14)>.
