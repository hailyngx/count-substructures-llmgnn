Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 8, 10, 12
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 3: 2, 6, 13
- Node 4: 2, 9, 13, 14
- Node 5: 6, 11, 12, 13, 14
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 10, 12
- Node 7: 2, 10, 14
- Node 8: 0, 1, 10, 12
- Node 9: 4, 11, 14
- Node 10: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 11: 5, 9
- Node 12: 1, 5, 6, 8, 14
- Node 13: 3, 4, 5
- Node 14: 4, 5, 7, 9, 12

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, and 12 each form 1 3-star
- Node 4, 5, 9, and 14 each form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- No other nodes form 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have 6 + 4(10) = 46. Therefore, the final answer is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 2>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 5, 14>, <4, 9, 14>, <5, 11, 12>, <8, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 1>, <8, 10, 6>, <8, 10, 7>, <9, 11, 14>.
