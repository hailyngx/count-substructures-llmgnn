Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 17) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (0, 3) (0, 7) (19, 7) (19, 18) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 17) (18, 1) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 16) (4, 14) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 14) (2, 3) (2, 17) 

Response:
First, we'll list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 7
- Node 1: 5, 6, 18
- Node 2: 3, 17
- Node 3: 0, 2, 15
- Node 4: 14
- Node 5: 1, 10, 13
- Node 6: 1, 9, 17
- Node 7: 0, 9, 11, 15, 19
- Node 8: 12, 14, 17
- Node 9: 6, 7
- Node 10: 5, 15, 16
- Node 11: 7, 15, 17
- Node 12: 7, 8, 17
- Node 13: 5, 16, 18
- Node 14: 4, 8, 16, 18
- Node 15: 3, 7, 10, 11
- Node 16: 10, 13, 14
- Node 17: 2, 6, 8, 11, 12
- Node 18: 1, 13, 14, 19
- Node 19: 7, 18

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 27.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 18)>, <5, (1, 10, 13)>, <7, (0, 9, 19)>, <8, (12, 14, 17)>, <13, (5, 16, 18)>, <14, (4, 16, 18)>, <15, (3, 10, 11)>, <17, (6, 11, 12)>
