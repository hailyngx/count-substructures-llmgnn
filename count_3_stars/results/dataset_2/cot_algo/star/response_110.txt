Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighborhood sets for each node:

Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 3}
Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 9}
Node 2: {6, 9}
Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 7, 8}
Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
Node 5: {1, 3, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 8}
Node 7: {0, 3, 4}
Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 9}
Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, and Node 9 have 4 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 50 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
