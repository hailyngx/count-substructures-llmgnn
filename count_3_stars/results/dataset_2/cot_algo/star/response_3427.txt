Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighborhood of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {5, 0, 7, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {5, 0, 9, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {2, 4, 0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 7, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {8, 0, 4, 3, 1}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42, so the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 0, 9)>
<4, (5, 0, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 0)>
<7, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (8, 0, 4)>
