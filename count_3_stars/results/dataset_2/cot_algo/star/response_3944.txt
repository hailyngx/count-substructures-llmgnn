Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {13}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 6, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 7, 11}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars formed = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [56].

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (3, 12, 6)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 12, 5)>, <0, (6, 11, 14)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 7, 12)>, <2, (6, 11, 12)>, <2, (6, 13, 14)>, <6, (0, 11, 14)>, <7, (4, 8, 13)>, <9, (5, 11, 13)>, <11, (3, 6, 14)>, <11, (6, 12, 14)>, <11, (6, 13, 14)>, <12, (0, 5, 7)>
