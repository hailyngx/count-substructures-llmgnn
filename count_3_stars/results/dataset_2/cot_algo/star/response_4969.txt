Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 24) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 17) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 14) (24, 2) (20, 21) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 4) (22, 4) (22, 27) (23, 2) (23, 27) (23, 16) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 1) (21, 20) (21, 28) (21, 10) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 18) (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 14) (13, 16) (1, 25) (1, 12) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 9) (18, 24) (18, 28) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 6) (19, 18) (19, 14) (10, 12) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 2) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 15) (16, 23) (16, 13) (16, 0) (4, 24) (4, 25) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 15) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 3) (3, 17) (3, 29) (11, 15) (8, 14) (8, 15) (14, 24) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 8) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 4) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 2) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 10) (2, 24) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 27) 

Response:
First, I will determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {16, 29, 15}
- Node 1: {25, 12}
- Node 2: {24, 23, 10, 27}
- Node 3: {17, 29}
- Node 4: {24, 25, 22, 9, 15}
- Node 5: {12, 29, 14}
- Node 6: {25, 26, 10}
- Node 7: {24, 12, 15, 17}
- Node 8: {14, 15}
- Node 9: {28, 17, 4}
- Node 10: {6, 2, 21, 12}
- Node 11: {15}
- Node 12: {7, 5, 10, 1}
- Node 13: {16}
- Node 14: {24, 5, 19, 8}
- Node 15: {7, 0, 4, 11, 8}
- Node 16: {23, 13, 0}
- Node 17: {7, 3, 9}
- Node 18: {24, 28, 26, 19}
- Node 19: {18, 14}
- Node 20: {21}
- Node 21: {20, 28, 10}
- Node 22: {24, 27, 4}
- Node 23: {2, 27, 16}
- Node 24: {7, 4, 18, 14, 2}
- Node 25: {1, 6, 4}
- Node 26: {18, 6}
- Node 27: {22, 23, 2}
- Node 28: {21, 9, 18}
- Node 29: {5, 0, 3}

Next, I will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, calculate \( \text{inom}(n,3) \) for each of these nodes, and sum up the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \text{inom}(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \text{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \text{inom}(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 28: \( \text{inom}(3, 3) = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (24, 10, 14)>
<4, (24, 18, 14)>
<7, (24, 12, 15)>
<7, (24, 15, 17)>
<9, (28, 17, 4)>
<10, (12, 21, 2)>
<12, (10, 1, 5)>
<14, (24, 5, 19)>
<15, (4, 7, 8)>
<15, (7, 11, 15)>
<18, (28, 19, 18)>
<21, (20, 10, 28)>
<24, (4, 14, 18)>
<24, (7, 15, 17)>
<24, (15, 18, 14)>
<24, (18, 2, 24)>
<28, (9, 18, 14)>
