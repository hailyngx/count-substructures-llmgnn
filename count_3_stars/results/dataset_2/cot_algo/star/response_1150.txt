Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (9, 0) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {13}
- Node 8: {4, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 5, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14.

Now, we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 94 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars is [94].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 2, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 10)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <5, (2, 11, 12)>
- <10, (2, 4, 6)>
- <12, (5, 11, 13)>
- <13, (0, 6, 9)>
- <14, (3, 5, 12)>
- <14, (2, 5, 12)>
- <14, (2, 11, 12)>
- <14, (3, 5, 12)>
