Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 18) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 12) (8, 16) (8, 18) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 13) (3, 5) (3, 0) (4, 19) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 16) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 17}
- Node 1: {5, 12, 15}
- Node 2: {0}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {19}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 13, 17}
- Node 7: {13, 14, 19}
- Node 8: {16, 18}
- Node 9: {5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {16}
- Node 11: {9, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 12: {1, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 13: {6, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 14: {7, 9, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 11, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {8, 10, 11, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 6, 18}
- Node 18: {8, 17}
- Node 19: {4, 7, 14}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up, we find that the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <5, (1, 9, 12)>
- <6, (0, 5, 13)>
- <9, (5, 11, 12)>
- <11, (9, 13, 15)>
- <12, (1, 9, 15)>
- <13, (6, 7, 12)>
- <14, (7, 9, 19)>
- <15, (1, 11, 16)>
- <16, (8, 11, 15)>
- <19, (4, 7, 14)>
