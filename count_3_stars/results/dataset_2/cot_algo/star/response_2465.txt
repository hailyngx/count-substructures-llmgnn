Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 2) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 6, 4, and 11. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

1. For node 6:
   Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 7, 3, 4, and 0.
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

2. For node 4:
   Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 10, 8, and 13.
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

3. For node 11:
   Node 11 has 7 neighbors: 10, 7, 13, 5, 12, 2, and 4.
   Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 35 = 49

Therefore, the final answer is [49], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (7, 3, 4)>, <4, (6, 9, 10)>, <4, (6, 8, 13)>, <11, (10, 7, 13)>, <11, (10, 5, 12)>, <11, (10, 2, 4)>, <11, (7, 13, 5)>, <11, (7, 12, 2)>, <11, (13, 5, 14)>.
