Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Given the input graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 1: {0}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 10}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 5, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 13}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 7, 11, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors {2, 5, 6, 9, 10}, forming inom{5}{3}=10 3-stars. 
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}, forming inom{6}{3}=20 3-stars. 
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors {0, 4, 9, 11, 14}, forming inom{5}{3}=10 3-stars. 
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors {3, 5, 7, 10, 12}, forming inom{5}{3}=10 3-stars. 
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors {3, 4, 5, 9, 11}, forming inom{5}{3}=10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors {9, 13, 14}, forming inom{3}{3}=1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors {2, 7, 11, 12}, forming inom{4}{3}=4 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 65.

Thus, the final answer is [65].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (3, 8, 10)>
- <7, (0, 9, 11)>
- <9, (3, 5, 10)>
- <10, (3, 4, 9)>
- <12, (9, 13, 14)>
- <14, (2, 7, 11)>
