Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 5) (3, 17) (11, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 14) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 16) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 16) (18, 6) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 9) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 16, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {7, 12, 16}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 17}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8, 18}
- Node 7: {4, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 14, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 7, 15, 16}
- Node 10: {15, 19}
- Node 11: {19}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 14: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 15: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 16: {2, 4, 9, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 5, 13}
- Node 18: {6}
- Node 19: {2, 8, 10, 11, 16}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \({3 \choose 3}\) = 1
- Node 2: \({5 \choose 3}\) = 10
- Node 6: \({3 \choose 3}\) = 1
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4
- Node 14: \({3 \choose 3}\) = 1
- Node 16: \({4 \choose 3}\) = 4
- Node 19: \({5 \choose 3}\) = 10

Adding them up: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 2, 9>, <2, 9, 16>, <2, 9, 19>, <2, 16, 19>, <6, 1, 17>, <9, 0, 16>, <9, 7, 4>, <9, 7, 16>, <14, 12, 0>, <19, 2, 16>
