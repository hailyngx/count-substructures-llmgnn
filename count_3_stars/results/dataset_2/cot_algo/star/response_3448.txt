Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 14) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 8) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 15) (19, 5) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 16}
Node 1: {0, 3, 9, 17}
Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 9, 11}
Node 3: {1, 5, 14}
Node 4: {2}
Node 5: {3, 11, 15, 19}
Node 6: {0, 2, 8, 13}
Node 7: {10, 13, 18}
Node 8: {6, 9, 18}
Node 9: {1, 2, 8, 13}
Node 10: {7, 17}
Node 11: {2, 5, 13}
Node 12: {14}
Node 13: {6, 7, 9, 11, 13}
Node 14: {3, 12}
Node 15: {5, 16}
Node 16: {0, 15, 18}
Node 17: {1, 10, 13}
Node 18: {7, 8, 16}
Node 19: {5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 16, 17
Number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 1: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 2: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 3: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 6: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 8: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \text{inom}{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 13: \( \text{inom}{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 16: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- Node 17: 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 46
