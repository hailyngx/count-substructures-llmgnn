Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 4) (11, 14) (11, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 10) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 10, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {10, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 6, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {8, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 10, 11}

Now, we identify which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 3: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Node 4: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 5: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 6: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 8: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 13: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Node 14: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is $4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 68$.

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 5>
- <0, 2, 14>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 14>
- <0, 5, 14>
- <3, 8, 13>
- <4, 5, 9>
- <4, 5, 14>
- <4, 6, 13>
- <4, 6, 14>
- <4, 9, 12>
- <5, 9, 12>
- <6, 8, 10>
- <8, 10, 14>
- <10, 12, 14>
- <10, 14, 11>
