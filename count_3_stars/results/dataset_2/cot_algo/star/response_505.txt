Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 10) (0, 16) (0, 19) (0, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 17) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 11) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 6) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (11, 12) (11, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

1: 12, 16, 14
2: 13, 9, 0, 5
3: 17, 5, 18
4: 13, 10
5: 3, 2
6: 10, 16, 17, 11
7: 8, 13
8: 17, 7
9: 18, 2, 19
10: 15, 6, 4
11: 12, 6
12: 18, 11, 1
13: 4, 2, 7
14: 16, 1, 19
15: 10, 18
16: 0, 6, 14
17: 3, 8, 18, 6
18: 15, 3, 12, 9, 17
19: 9, 0, 14

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 10, 16, and 17:
<6, (10, 16, 17)>

Node 18 forms 10 3-stars with the following neighbors:
<18, (3, 15, 17)>
<18, (3, 12, 9)>
<18, (3, 9, 17)>
<18, (3, 9, 15)>
<18, (3, 12, 17)>
<18, (15, 10, 17)>
<18, (15, 10, 3)>
<18, (15, 12, 3)>
<18, (15, 12, 9)>
<18, (10, 6, 17)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
