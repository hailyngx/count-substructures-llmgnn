Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 23) (5, 27) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (9, 12) (2, 29) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 23) (29, 3) (29, 4) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 27) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 3) (26, 17) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 17) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 13) (28, 26) (28, 11) (28, 24) (4, 29) (4, 25) (27, 5) (27, 9) (27, 1) (27, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (21, 12) (21, 25) (21, 17) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (23, 5) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 3) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 9) (18, 19) (7, 11) (7, 24) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 21) (14, 6) (14, 15) (25, 4) (25, 21) (25, 16) (25, 0) (3, 29) (3, 26) (3, 8) (3, 23) (20, 22) (20, 16) (24, 28) (24, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 16) (13, 11) (13, 10) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 10) (22, 8) (22, 20) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 25) (15, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 12, 25
- Node 1: 0, 10, 13, 27
- Node 2: 19, 23, 29
- Node 3: 8, 23, 26, 29
- Node 4: 25, 29
- Node 5: 23, 27
- Node 6: 0, 14
- Node 7: 11, 24
- Node 8: 3, 9, 12, 22
- Node 9: 8, 12, 18, 27
- Node 10: 1, 13, 16
- Node 11: 7, 13, 23, 28
- Node 12: 0, 8, 9, 21
- Node 13: 1, 10, 11
- Node 14: 6, 15
- Node 15: 14
- Node 16: 10, 20, 25
- Node 17: 19, 21, 26, 27
- Node 18: 9, 19
- Node 19: 2, 17, 18, 26
- Node 20: 16, 22
- Node 21: 12, 17, 25
- Node 22: 8, 20
- Node 23: 2, 3, 5, 11
- Node 24: 7, 28
- Node 25: 0, 4, 16, 21
- Node 26: 3, 17, 19, 28
- Node 27: 1, 5, 9, 17
- Node 28: 11, 24, 26
- Node 29: 2, 3, 4

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 3 neighbors
- Node 23: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 4 neighbors
- Node 27: 4 neighbors
- Node 28: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} + 8 \cdot \binom{4}{3} + 6 \cdot \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 32 + 6 = 39 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 25, 16>, <0, 25, 21>, <0, 25, 1>, <0, 25, 4>, <1, 27, 9>, <1, 27, 17>, <1, 10, 16>,
<1, 10, 13>, <3, 26, 17>, <3, 26, 19>, <3, 26, 28>, <3, 26, 8>, <4, 29, 2>, <4, 29, 23>,
<8, 12, 9>, <8, 12, 21>, <8, 22, 20>, <8, 22, 3>, <9, 12, 21>, <9, 12, 8>, <9, 18, 19>,
<9, 18, 27>, <11, 23, 7>, <11, 23, 28>, <11, 13, 7>, <11, 13, 10>, <12, 9, 21>, <12, 9, 8>,
<17, 27, 19>, <17, 27, 21>, <17, 27, 1>, <17, 27, 5>, <19, 18, 9>, <19, 18, 26>, <19, 18, 17>,
<19, 26, 17>, <23, 5, 27>, <23, 5, 11>, <23, 29, 2>, <23, 29, 3>, <25, 0, 6>, <25, 0, 21>,
<25, 0, 1>, <25, 0, 12>, <26, 28, 11>, <26, 28, 24>, <26, 19, 2>, <26, 19, 17>, <27, 17, 21>,
<27, 17, 19>, <27, 17, 1>, <27, 17, 5>.
