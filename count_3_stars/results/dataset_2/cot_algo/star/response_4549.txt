Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 10, 11, 14
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 10, 11
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 8, 13
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 4, 12, 13
- Node 7: 5, 9, 14
- Node 8: 0, 4, 12, 13, 14
- Node 9: 5, 7, 12
- Node 10: 1, 3, 13
- Node 11: 1, 3, 12, 14
- Node 12: 6, 8, 9, 11
- Node 13: 4, 6, 8, 10
- Node 14: 1, 7, 8, 11

Next, let's identify the nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 8, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14

Now, for each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 44, and we represent it as [44]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 10, 11>
- <4, 5, 8, 13>
- <4, 5, 8, 14>
- <4, 6, 12, 13>
- <8, 12, 13, 14>
