Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 15) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 13) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 16) (18, 11) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 2) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 16) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 4) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 11) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 19}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 17}
- Node 3: {0}
- Node 4: {2, 10, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 5: {9, 19}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 17}
- Node 7: {2, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 16}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 8, 18}
- Node 12: {7, 15, 17}
- Node 13: {4, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {4, 13}
- Node 15: {12, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {4, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 17: {2, 6, 12}
- Node 18: {11, 16}
- Node 19: {1, 5, 13, 15}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 8, 11)>, <4, (2, 13, 14)>, <4, (10, 16, 15)>, <0, (1, 8, 11)>, <19, (13, 15, 1)>, <16, (4, 18, 10)>
