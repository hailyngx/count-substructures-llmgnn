Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 1, 3, 8, 7}
- Node 1: {6, 3, 4, 0}
- Node 2: {5, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 1, 8, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 6, 0}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 8, 4, 7}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <1, 3, 4>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 9>
- <5, 9, 2>
- <5, 9, 4>
- <6, 7, 9>
- <6, 9, 4>
- <6, 9, 7>
- <6, 9, 8>
