Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 9) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 2: neighbors {4, 5, 12}
- Node 3: neighbors {10, 11, 12}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 4, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 9: neighbors {0, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 10: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7, 11}
- Node 11: neighbors {3, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 12: neighbors {1, 2, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 13: neighbors {0, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 14: neighbors {8, 9, 11}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: Just one 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 0, 12, and 13 as leaves (<9, 0, 12, 13>)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: Just one 3-star with node 13 as the center and nodes 7, 9, and 12 as leaves (<13, 7, 9, 12>)
- Node 14: No 3-stars as it has less than 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 50

Thus, the final answer is [50].
