Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) 

Response:
Since this graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can see that it is a connected graph. To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll first calculate the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 14}
Node 1: {0, 2, 6}
Node 2: {1, 5, 9, 14}
Node 3: {0, 9, 13}
Node 4: {8, 10, 13, 14}
Node 5: {2, 4, 12, 13, 14}
Node 6: {1, 7, 9, 11, 12}
Node 7: {6, 10, 12}
Node 8: {4, 11}
Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 11}
Node 10: {4, 7, 11, 12}
Node 11: {6, 8, 9, 10, 12}
Node 12: {5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13}
Node 13: {3, 4, 5, 12}
Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 5}

Now, we can see that nodes 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 56.

Therefore, the final answer, with the total number of 3-stars inside brackets and the unique 3-stars listed inside <> is: [56]
