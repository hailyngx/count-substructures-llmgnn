Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 7) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 25) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 16) (27, 4) (27, 23) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 12) (21, 10) (21, 2) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 6) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 20) (18, 7) (13, 26) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 23) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 5) (4, 27) (4, 11) (4, 28) (23, 27) (23, 13) (23, 6) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 9) (19, 29) (22, 16) (22, 20) (29, 9) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 29) (24, 11) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 25) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 16) (20, 18) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 26) (25, 28) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 5) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {12, 13, 15}
- Node 2: {10, 17, 21}
- Node 3: {5, 14, 16, 29}
- Node 4: {11, 27, 28}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 16}
- Node 6: {8, 10, 11, 16, 23}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 18, 5}
- Node 8: {6, 20}
- Node 9: {19, 26, 29, 7}
- Node 10: {17, 21, 6}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 24}
- Node 12: {13, 15, 29, 1}
- Node 13: {12, 14, 1, 26, 23}
- Node 14: {3, 13, 17, 28}
- Node 15: {1, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 6, 15, 22}
- Node 17: {2, 10, 14}
- Node 18: {7, 20}
- Node 19: {9, 29}
- Node 20: {8, 18, 22}
- Node 21: {2, 10}
- Node 22: {16, 20}
- Node 23: {6, 13, 27}
- Node 24: {11}
- Node 25: {26, 28}
- Node 26: {9, 13, 25}
- Node 27: {4, 23}
- Node 28: {4, 14, 25}
- Node 29: {3, 12, 19}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 6 and node 13 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 1, node 5, and node 12 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 3, node 7, node 10, node 14, and node 16 have 4 neighbors each.

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \]

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (8, 11, 23)>
- <13, (1, 3, 12)>
- <1, (12, 13, 15)>
- <5, (3, 7, 16)>
- <12, (1, 13, 29)>
- <3, (5, 14, 16)>
- <7, (5, 9, 18)>
- <10, (6, 17, 21)>
- <14, (3, 17, 28)>
- <16, (3, 5, 6)>
