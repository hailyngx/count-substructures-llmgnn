Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges based on the nodes they connect:
- Node 0: {0, 1}, {0, 3}, {0, 4}, {0, 6}
- Node 1: {1, 0}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {1, 6}, {1, 9}
- Node 2: {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {2, 8}
- Node 3: {3, 0}, {3, 1}, {3, 6}, {3, 8}, {3, 9}
- Node 4: {4, 0}, {4, 1}, {4, 2}, {4, 6}
- Node 5: {5, 2}, {5, 7}, {5, 8}, {5, 9}
- Node 6: {6, 0}, {6, 1}, {6, 3}, {6, 4}
- Node 7: {7, 5}, {7, 8}
- Node 8: {8, 2}, {8, 3}, {8, 5}, {8, 7}, {8, 9}
- Node 9: {9, 1}, {9, 3}, {9, 5}, {9, 8}

Now, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify which nodes can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Forms 1 unique 3-star <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 2: Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: Forms 1 unique 3-star <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 4: Forms 1 unique 3-star <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- Node 5: Forms 1 unique 3-star <5, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: Forms 1 unique 3-star <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 7: Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Forms 1 unique 3-star <8, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

The total number of 3-stars formed is 5, so the answer is [5].
