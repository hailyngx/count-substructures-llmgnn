Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 13) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 10) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {8, 13, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {10, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 12, 10}
- Node 3: {11, 14, 6, 13, 5}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 12, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 8, 13, 2, 11}
- Node 6: {3, 0, 11}
- Node 7: {13}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 10, 11, 0}
- Node 9: {1, 13, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 8, 2}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 11, 2, 14, 9}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 9, 7, 0}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 12}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <3, (11, 5, 13)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <4, (12, 10, 14)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <8, (5, 10, 11)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <10, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <13, (9, 5, 3)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. So, the final answer is [5].
