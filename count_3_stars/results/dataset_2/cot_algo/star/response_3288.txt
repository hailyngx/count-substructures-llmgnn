Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 2) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 15) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 15) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 2) (4, 14) (4, 6) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 14, 17, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 17, 18, 0}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 7}
- Node 4: {14, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 2}
- Node 6: {16, 8, 4, 19}
- Node 7: {3}
- Node 8: {3, 13, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 2}
- Node 10: {11, 17, 12}
- Node 11: {16, 10, 0, 15}
- Node 12: {10, 15}
- Node 13: {5, 8, 15}
- Node 14: {17, 0, 4}
- Node 15: {11, 13, 12}
- Node 16: {11, 19, 6}
- Node 17: {14, 10, 0, 2, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 1, 2}
- Node 19: {16, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 17, and Node 3 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 11, Node 6, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors.
- The rest of the nodes have less than 3 neighbors.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 2, 17>
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 3, 17>
- <2, 3, 17>
- <2, 3, 18>
- <0, 2, 18>
- (11, 15, 13)
- (0, 14, 4)
- (6, 16, 19)
- (6, 8, 13)
