Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 13) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 0) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 2) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 7) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 9, 19
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 4, 12, 13, 15
- Node 3: 8, 12, 13, 14, 15
- Node 4: 2, 5, 10, 12, 18
- Node 5: 4, 9, 11, 17, 19
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1, 8, 14
- Node 8: 3, 7
- Node 9: 0, 5, 17
- Node 10: 4, 14
- Node 11: 5, 16
- Node 12: 2, 3, 4
- Node 13: 2, 3, 16
- Node 14: 3, 7, 10
- Node 15: 2, 3, 15, 19
- Node 16: 11, 13, 17
- Node 17: 5, 9, 16, 18
- Node 18: 4, 17
- Node 19: 0, 5, 15

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Calculations:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total 3-stars:
4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [47].

Unique 3-stars:
<2, 12, 13>, <2, 12, 15>, <2, 13, 15>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 15>, <3, 12, 13>, <3, 12, 14>, <3, 12, 15>, <3, 13, 16>, <3, 13, 16>, <4, 5, 18>, <4, 5, 17>, <5, 9, 17>, <5, 9, 19>, <5, 11, 16>, <7, 14, 10>, <15, 19, 0>, <16, 11, 13>, <17, 5, 18>, <17, 5, 9>
