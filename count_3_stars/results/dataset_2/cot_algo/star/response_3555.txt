Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (12, 6) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (2, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 18) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 11, 13
- Node 1: 5, 7, 12
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 8, 13
- Node 5: 1, 6, 14, 17
- Node 6: 3, 5, 8, 12
- Node 7: 1, 17, 19
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 18
- Node 9: 2, 3, 16, 19
- Node 10: 13, 18
- Node 11: 0, 16
- Node 12: 1, 6, 18
- Node 13: 0, 4, 10
- Node 14: 5, 15, 18
- Node 15: 14
- Node 16: 11, 17, 18
- Node 17: 5, 7, 16, 19
- Node 18: 8, 10, 12, 14, 16
- Node 19: 7, 9, 17

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 5: <5, (1, 6, 17)>
- Node 6: <6, (3, 5, 8)> and <6, (5, 12, 17)>
- Node 8: <8, (3, 4, 6)> and <8, (6, 12, 18)> and <8, (6, 17, 18)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 19)> and <9, (3, 16, 19)> and <9, (16, 17, 19)>
- Node 16: <16, (11, 17, 18)> and <16, (17, 18, 19)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 11. So, the answer is [11].
