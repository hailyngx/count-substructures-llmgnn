Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (12, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 8, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 2, 13, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 8, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 0, 11}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 4, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 3, 7, 2, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 13, 6, 0}
- Node 8: {13, 2, 14, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 2, 14, 10, 0}
- Node 10: {9}
- Node 11: {5, 13, 6, 14, 4}
- Node 12: {14}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 8, 11, 7}
- Node 14: {9, 8, 11, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 72 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (9, 8, 4)>, <1, (5, 2, 13)>, <1, (5, 7, 13)>, <1, (3, 7, 13)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 3, 13)>, <3, (1, 13, 7)>, <8, (2, 14, 7)>, <8, (0, 14, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 13)>, <9, (4, 14, 0)>, <9, (4, 14, 11)>, <9, (4, 0, 11)>, <9, (4, 0, 9)>, <11, (5, 13, 6)>, <11, (5, 14, 4)>, <11, (5, 6, 4)>, <11, (4, 14, 6)>, <11, (13, 4, 6)>.
