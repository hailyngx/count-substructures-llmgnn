Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 14) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 7}
- Node 4: {2, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {10, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 8, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ inom{4}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{5}{3} + inom{6}{3} + inom{7}{3} = 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 35 = 129 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [129].
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 11)>, <0, (3, 7, 11)>, <0, (5, 7, 11)>, <2, (4, 7, 13)>, <2, (4, 10, 12)>, <2, (7, 10, 13)>, <2, (10, 12, 14)>, <4, (8, 11, 14)>, <4, (10, 11, 12)>, <4, (10, 11, 14)>, <4, (10, 12, 14)>, <4, (11, 12, 14)>, <7, (8, 11, 13)>, <7, (8, 11, 14)>, <7, (8, 13, 14)>, <7, (11, 13, 14)>, <8, (11, 12, 14)>, <10, (11, 12, 14)>
