Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 17) (16, 18) (26, 18) (2, 24) (2, 14) (2, 7) (29, 20) (29, 3) (20, 29) (20, 21) (20, 6) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 27) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 27) (28, 8) (28, 6) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 24) (21, 4) (24, 2) (24, 21) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 19) (4, 21) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 17) (27, 8) (27, 6) (27, 24) (27, 4) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 25) (5, 10) (17, 16) (17, 25) (17, 4) (17, 23) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 23) (14, 19) (22, 10) (22, 15) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 19) (19, 24) (19, 14) (19, 15) (19, 23) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 23) (0, 1) (3, 29) (3, 24) (3, 0) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 22) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 11, 23}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 10}
Node 2: Neighbors {7, 14, 24}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 24, 29}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 14, 17, 21, 27}
Node 5: Neighbors {10}
Node 6: Neighbors {20, 27, 28}
Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 13}
Node 8: Neighbors {13, 21, 27, 28}
Node 10: Neighbors {1, 5, 10, 22}
Node 11: Neighbors {0, 13, 14}
Node 13: Neighbors {7, 8, 11, 15}
Node 14: Neighbors {2, 11, 19, 23}
Node 15: Neighbors {13, 19, 22, 25}
Node 16: Neighbors {17, 18}
Node 17: Neighbors {4, 14, 17, 23, 25}
Node 18: Neighbors {16, 25, 26}
Node 19: Neighbors {14, 15, 19, 23, 24}
Node 20: Neighbors {6, 21, 27, 29}
Node 21: Neighbors {4, 8, 20, 24}
Node 22: Neighbors {10, 15, 22}
Node 23: Neighbors {0, 4, 14, 17, 19}
Node 24: Neighbors {2, 3, 19, 21, 27}
Node 25: Neighbors {15, 17, 18}
Node 26: Neighbors {18}
Node 27: Neighors {4, 6, 8, 20, 24}
Node 28: Neighbors {6, 8}
Node 29: Neighbors {3, 20}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1
Node 4: 1
Node 8: 1
Node 13: 1
Node 14: 1
Node 15: 1
Node 17: 1
Node 19: 1
Node 21: 1
Node 23: 1
Node 24: 1
Node 27: 1

Total number of 3-stars formed = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 10>
<4, 14, 19>
<8, 13, 21>
<13, 7, 15>
<14, 11, 23>
<15, 19, 22>
<17, 4, 23>
<19, 14, 24>
<21, 4, 27>
<23, 0, 14>
<24, 2, 27>
<27, 6, 20>
