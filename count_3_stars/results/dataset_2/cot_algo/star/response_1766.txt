Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 4, 9
- Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: Neighbors are 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: Neighbors are 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 5: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: Neighbors are 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 5
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 55 3-stars, so the final answer is [55].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
