Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 18) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (7, 16) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 14) (2, 6) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 19) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 18) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 13) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 16) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighborhood sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 11, 19}
- Node 1: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 17}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {16}
- Node 8: {4, 15, 19}
- Node 9: {1, 4}
- Node 10: {6, 17, 18}
- Node 11: {0, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 6}
- Node 13: {1, 11, 16}
- Node 14: {2, 15}
- Node 15: {8, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 16: {7, 13, 18}
- Node 17: {3, 10, 15, 18}
- Node 18: {10, 16, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 8, 15}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 11, 19)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 10)>, <15, (8, 17, 19)>, <17, (10, 15, 18)>
