Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 0) (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 12) (6, 22) (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 20) (1, 3) (1, 26) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 14) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 21) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 21) (25, 20) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 2) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 29) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 10) (26, 1) (26, 8) (2, 18) (2, 25) (2, 15) (2, 0) (21, 18) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 10) (29, 20) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 10) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 29) (10, 12) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 2) (28, 13) (28, 3) (28, 15) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 10) (14, 3) (14, 23) (14, 7) (17, 7) (27, 13) (7, 14) (7, 17) (19, 25) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 28) 

Response:
After analyzing the provided graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first determine the neighbor nodes for each node.

The neighbor nodes for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 16
- Node 1: 3, 26
- Node 2: 0, 15, 18, 25
- Node 3: 1, 14, 28
- Node 4: 11, 12, 13
- Node 5: 0, 10, 29
- Node 6: 9, 18, 22
- Node 7: 14, 17
- Node 8: 23, 26, 29
- Node 9: 6, 11, 20
- Node 10: 5, 12, 21, 29
- Node 11: 4, 9, 12, 15
- Node 12: 4, 10, 11, 22
- Node 13: 4, 22, 23, 27, 28
- Node 14: 3, 7, 23
- Node 15: 11, 15, 18, 28
- Node 16: 0
- Node 17: 7
- Node 18: 2, 6, 15, 21
- Node 19: 25
- Node 20: 9, 20, 21, 25, 29
- Node 21: 10, 18, 20, 25
- Node 22: 6, 12, 13
- Node 23: 8, 13, 14, 29
- Node 25: 2, 19, 20, 21
- Node 26: 1, 8
- Node 27: 13
- Node 28: 3, 13, 15
- Node 29: 5, 8, 10, 20, 23

Now we will identify the 3-star formations in this graph:
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves (22, 23, 28)
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with leaves (11, 18, 28)
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 15, 21)
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with leaves (10, 21, 25)
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with leaves (10, 18, 25)
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with leaves (6, 12, 13)
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with leaves (8, 14, 29)

Total number of 3-stars: 7
Therefore, the final answer is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <13, (22, 23, 28)>
- <15, (11, 18, 28)>
- <18, (2, 15, 21)>
- <20, (10, 21, 25)>
- <21, (10, 18, 25)>
- <22, (6, 12, 13)>
- <23, (8, 14, 29)>
