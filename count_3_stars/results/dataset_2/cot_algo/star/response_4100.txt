Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

1: 6, 9, 14, 10
2: 9, 8, 0, 10, 7
3: 10, 12
4: 6, 13, 5, 14
5: 8, 13, 12, 4
6: 9, 1, 11, 12, 4
7: 8, 0, 2, 11, 10
8: 2, 5, 7
9: 6, 2, 1, 0
10: 2, 7, 3, 1, 12
11: 13, 0, 7, 6
12: 5, 0, 3, 10, 6
13: 5, 4, 11
14: 1, 4

Now, we can see which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 1 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 2 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 4 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 5 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 6 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 7 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 10 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 12 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 14 can form 2 choose 3 = 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52

So, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 6, 9>, <1, 6, 14>, <1, 6, 10>, <1, 9, 14>, <1, 9, 10>, <2, 9, 8>, <2, 9, 10>, <2, 8, 7>, <2, 0, 8>, <2, 0, 10>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 13, 11>, <4, 5, 13>, <5, 8, 13>, <5, 8, 12>, <5, 13, 12>, <5, 4, 13>, <6, 9, 1>, <6, 9, 11>, <6, 9, 12>, <6, 1, 11>, <6, 1, 12>, <7, 8, 0>, <7, 8, 2>, <7, 8, 11>, <7, 0, 2>, <7, 0, 11>, <7, 2, 11>, <7, 2, 10>, <7, 11, 10>, <10, 2, 7>, <10, 2, 1>, <10, 2, 12>, <10, 7, 3>, <10, 7, 1>, <10, 7, 12>, <10, 3, 12>, <10, 1, 12>, <12, 5, 0>, <12, 5, 3>, <12, 5, 10>, <12, 0, 3>, <12, 0, 10>
