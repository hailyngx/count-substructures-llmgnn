Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {9, 7, 4}
- Node 1: {7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 6, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {3, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 2, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 7, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 7, 0}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 0 3-stars
- Node 2: 20 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 4 3-stars
- Node 6: 0 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 3-stars
- Node 9: 4 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 40. 

Therefore, the final answer, after putting the total number of 3-stars inside brackets, and listing the unique 3-stars found inside <> each only once, is:
[40]

<2, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>
