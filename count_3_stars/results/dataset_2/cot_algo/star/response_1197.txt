Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 8) (21, 17) (15, 5) (15, 4) (27, 10) (27, 17) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 23) (8, 21) (8, 16) (8, 22) (13, 3) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 24) (2, 16) (2, 20) (18, 19) (18, 20) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 4) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 28) (26, 13) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 16) (26, 12) (7, 28) (17, 21) (17, 27) (17, 13) (17, 20) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 10) (29, 5) (29, 11) (10, 21) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 20) (10, 6) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 9) (12, 26) (12, 24) (23, 25) (23, 14) (23, 26) (22, 8) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 24) (24, 13) (24, 12) (24, 11) (24, 5) (9, 25) (9, 4) (28, 19) (28, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 29) (5, 24) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 26) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0:  Connected to nodes 14, 5, 6
- Node 1:  Connected to nodes 21, 11, 5
- Node 2:  Connected to nodes 16, 20
- Node 3:  Connected to nodes 25, 10, 13, 19
- Node 4:  Connected to nodes 15, 14, 9
- Node 5:  Connected to nodes 1, 15, 0, 29, 24
- Node 6:  Connected to nodes 0, 10
- Node 7:  Connected to node 28
- Node 8:  Connected to nodes 21, 16, 22
- Node 9:  Connected to nodes 25, 4
- Node 10:  Connected to nodes 21, 27, 3, 20, 6
- Node 11:  Connected to nodes 1, 29, 24
- Node 12:  Connected to nodes 26, 24
- Node 13:  Connected to nodes 3, 26, 17, 24
- Node 14:  Connected to nodes 0, 23, 4
- Node 15:  Connected to nodes 5, 4
- Node 16:  Connected to nodes 8, 2, 26
- Node 17:  Connected to nodes 21, 27, 13, 20
- Node 18:  Connected to nodes 19, 20
- Node 19:  Connected to nodes 3, 18, 26, 28
- Node 20:  Connected to nodes 2, 18, 17, 10
- Node 21:  Connected to nodes 1, 10, 8, 17
- Node 22:  Connected to node 8
- Node 23:  Connected to nodes 25, 14, 26
- Node 24:  Connected to nodes 13, 12, 11, 5
- Node 25:  Connected to nodes 3, 9, 23
- Node 26:  Connected to nodes 13, 19, 23, 16, 12
- Node 27:  Connected to nodes 10, 17
- Node 28:  Connected to nodes 19, 7
- Node 29:  Connected to nodes 5, 11

Next, we will identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and hence can form a 3-star.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 10, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 19: 1
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 1
- Node 24: 1
- Node 26: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 11

Therefore, the final answer is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (14, 5, 6)>
<1, (21, 11, 5)>
<5, (15, 0, 24)>
<10, (27, 3, 20)>
<13, (26, 17, 24)>
<14, (23, 4, 0)>
<19, (18, 26, 28)>
<20, (18, 17, 10)>
<21, (8, 16, 17)>
<24, (13, 12, 11)>
<26, (16, 23, 13)>
