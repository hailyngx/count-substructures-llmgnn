Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 5, 9, 7, 8  
Node 1: 5, 3, 6, 8  
Node 2: 9, 7, 3, 6, 8  
Node 3: 9, 1, 2  
Node 4: 5, 9, 7, 6  
Node 5: 8, 1, 4, 0, 7  
Node 6: 4, 1, 2  
Node 7: 5, 4, 0, 2  
Node 8: 5, 1, 2, 0  
Node 9: 4, 2, 3, 0  

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, and 9

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the final result is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <6, (4, 1, 2)>, and <9, (4, 2, 0)>.
