Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first analyze the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9, 10}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 7}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 3, 7, 12}

Now we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it is part of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
  
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it is part of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  <5, (4, 9, 12)>, <5, (4, 9, 13)>, <5, (9, 12, 13)>, <5, (4, 12, 13)>
  
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it is part of \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
  <7, (4, 12, 14)>, <7, (4, 8, 12)>, <7, (4, 8, 14)>, <7, (4, 11, 12)>, <7, (4, 11, 14)>,
  <7, (4, 12, 13)>, <7, (4, 13, 14)>, <7, (8, 11, 12)>, <7, (8, 12, 13)>, <7, (8, 12, 14)>,
  <7, (8, 13, 14)>, <7, (11, 12, 14)>, <7, (12, 13, 14)>, <7, (4, 8, 11)>, <7, (4, 11, 13)>,
  <7, (8, 11, 13)>, <7, (11, 12, 13)>, <7, (12, 13, 14)>, <7, (4, 12, 14)>, <7, (4, 13, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 20 = 28 \), so the final answer is [28].
