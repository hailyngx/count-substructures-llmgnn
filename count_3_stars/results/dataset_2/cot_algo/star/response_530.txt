Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more readable format:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 8.  
Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.  
Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 7, and 9.  
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 9.  
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9.  
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.  
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.  
Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.  
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.  
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.  

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

For Node 2, we have neighbors [0, 4, 6, 7, 9]. There are 5 nodes, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
These 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
