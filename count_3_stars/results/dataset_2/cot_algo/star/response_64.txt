Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 8) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 9) (1, 16) (5, 10) (5, 14) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 18) (17, 8) (17, 16) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (13, 19) (13, 3) (13, 18) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 13) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 13) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {18, 12}
- Node 1: {16}
- Node 2: {9, 3, 15}
- Node 3: {2, 16, 6, 13}
- Node 4: {7, 14, 6}
- Node 5: {10, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 10, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 19}
- Node 8: {15, 17, 18}
- Node 9: {2, 12, 19, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 12, 15}
- Node 12: {0, 11, 9}
- Node 13: {19, 3, 18}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 15: {2, 11, 19, 8}
- Node 16: {1, 17, 3, 18}
- Node 17: {8, 16}
- Node 18: {0, 8, 16, 13}
- Node 19: {7, 15, 13, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 2: Since it has 3 neighbors (9, 3, 15), it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
- Node 3: Since it has 4 neighbors (2, 16, 6, 13), it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
- Node 8: Since it has 3 neighbors (15, 17, 18), it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
- Node 9: Since it has 4 neighbors (2, 12, 19, 14), it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
- Node 12: Since it has 3 neighbors (0, 11, 9), it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
- Node 15: Since it has 4 neighbors (2, 11, 19, 8), it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
- Node 16: Since it has 4 neighbors (1, 17, 3, 18), it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
- Node 18: Since it has 4 neighbors (0, 8, 16, 13), it can form a 3-star. Total: 1
- Node 19: Since it has 4 neighbors (7, 15, 13, 9), it can form a 3-star. Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (9, 3, 15)>
- <3, (2, 16, 6)>
- <8, (15, 17, 18)>
- <9, (2, 12, 19)>
- <12, (0, 11, 9)>
- <15, (2, 11, 19, 8)>
- <16, (1, 17, 3, 18)>
- <18, (0, 8, 16, 13)>
- <19, (7, 15, 13, 9)>
