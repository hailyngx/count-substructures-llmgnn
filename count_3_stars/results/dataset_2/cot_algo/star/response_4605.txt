Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

For each node, let's find its neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Adding them up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
