Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 28) (9, 12) (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 2) (8, 4) (8, 25) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 21) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 22) (0, 12) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 25) (22, 0) (22, 28) (22, 3) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 17) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 18) (24, 29) (17, 26) (17, 20) (20, 17) (20, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 16) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 3) (19, 13) (16, 1) (21, 4) (21, 13) (21, 2) (11, 5) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 12) (3, 22) (3, 19) (3, 29) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 10) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 21) (13, 7) (28, 5) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 19) (7, 23) (7, 13) (7, 2) (29, 0) (29, 14) (29, 26) (29, 24) (29, 3) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (10, 23) (10, 25) (18, 24) (18, 11) (2, 27) (2, 21) (2, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors.

From the list of edges given, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {23, 14, 29, 22, 12}
Node 1: {15, 4, 25, 16}
Node 2: {27, 21, 7}
Node 3: {22, 19, 29}
Node 4: {8, 1, 21, 13}
Node 5: {11, 28}
Node 7: {23, 13, 2}
Node 8: {4, 25}
Node 9: {12}
Node 10: {23, 25}
Node 11: {5, 24, 18, 12}
Node 12: {9, 0, 11}
Node 13: {4, 19, 21, 7}
Node 14: {15, 0, 29, 25}
Node 15: {27, 1, 14}
Node 16: {1}
Node 17: {26, 20}
Node 18: {24, 11}
Node 19: {20, 28, 3, 13}
Node 20: {17, 19}
Node 21: {4, 2, 13}
Node 22: {0, 28, 3}
Node 23: {7, 10, 0}
Node 24: {26, 11, 18, 29}
Node 25: {8, 1, 10, 14}
Node 26: {24, 29, 17}
Node 27: {15, 28, 2}
Node 28: {5, 27, 22, 19}
Node 29: {26, 24, 17, 3, 0}

Based on the neighbor sets, the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 29: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 56 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
