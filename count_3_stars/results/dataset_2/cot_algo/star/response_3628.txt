Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 2) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) 

Response:
We will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 7}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 6, 8, 11}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 7, and 10: <4, (1, 7, 10)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 11, and 14: <6, (9, 11, 14)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 4, and 13: <7, (1, 4, 13)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 11, and 12: <9, (6, 11, 12)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 3, and 4: <10, (2, 3, 4)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 6, and 14: <11, (5, 6, 14)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [6].
