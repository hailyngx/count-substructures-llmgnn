Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 10) (0, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 12) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (16, 8) (16, 13) (9, 7) (6, 2) (6, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 12) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 15) 

Response:
Since this graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can conclude that it is a simple, connected graph with no self-loops and no parallel edges.

Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 5}
- Node 1: {13, 4, 14, 12}
- Node 2: {13, 18, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {11, 17, 19}
- Node 4: {5, 1, 17}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 0, 19, 15}
- Node 6: {2, 19}
- Node 7: {14, 9}
- Node 8: {16, 17}
- Node 9: {7}
- Node 10: {0, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 18, 1, 15}
- Node 13: {17, 16, 2, 1}
- Node 14: {10, 2, 7, 1}
- Node 15: {18, 5, 12}
- Node 16: {8, 13}
- Node 17: {13, 4, 3, 8}
- Node 18: {2, 15, 12}
- Node 19: {3, 5, 6}

Now, let's look at the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <1, (13, 4, 12)>
    - <1, (13, 14, 12)>
    - <1, (4, 14, 12)>
    - <1, (13, 4, 14)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <2, (13, 18, 5)>
    - <2, (13, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (13, 5, 14)>
    - <2, (13, 6, 14)>
    - <2, (18, 5, 6)>
    - <2, (18, 5, 14)>
    - <2, (18, 6, 14)>
    - <2, (5, 6, 19)>
    - <2, (5, 14, 19)>
    - <2, (6, 14, 19)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <3, (11, 17, 19)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
    - <4, (5, 1, 17)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
    - <5, (2, 4, 19)>
    - <5, (2, 0, 15)>
    - <5, (2, 15, 19)>
    - <5, (4, 15, 19)>
    - <5, (0, 15, 19)>
    - <5, (3, 17, 19)>
    - <5, (17, 6, 19)>
    - <5, (6, 14, 19)>
    - <5, (14, 1, 19)>
    - <5, (1, 12, 19)>
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <12, (11, 18, 15)>
    - <12, (18, 1, 15)>
    - <12, (11, 1, 15)>
    - <12, (11, 18, 1)>
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
    - <13, (17, 16, 2)>
    - <13, (17, 1, 16)>
    - <13, (2, 1, 16)>
    - <13, (17, 1, 2)>

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [34].
