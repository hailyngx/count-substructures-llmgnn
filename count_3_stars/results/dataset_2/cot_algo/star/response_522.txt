Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 1) (4, 0) 

Response:
The 3-star graph can be formed as follows:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 8}
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1}
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 9}
Node 6: Neighbors {2, 8, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 7, 8}

Node 0, Node 1, Node 5, Node 7, and Node 8 have 5 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with them.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3>
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 2, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
