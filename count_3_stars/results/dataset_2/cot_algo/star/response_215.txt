Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 13) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 16) (0, 9) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 19) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9}
- Node 1: {10, 11, 16}
- Node 2: {11, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 3: {11, 18}
- Node 4: {15, 17}
- Node 6: {9, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 7: {8, 12, 18}
- Node 8: {7, 15, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 10, 13, 15, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 12: {7, 10, 16}
- Node 13: {9, 19}
- Node 14: {2, 16, 19}
- Node 15: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 16: {1, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 10}
- Node 18: {3, 7}
- Node 19: {6, 8, 9, 13, 14}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 15, 19)>
- Node 9 forms four 3-stars: 
   <9, (6, 15, 19)>, <9, (0, 15, 19)>, <9, (10, 15, 19)>, <9, (13, 19, 15)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (1, 6, 14)>
- Node 19 forms three 3-stars: 
   <19, (6, 8, 9)>, <19, (6, 13, 14)>, <19, (14, 16, 2)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10, so the final answer is [10].
