Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 29) (17, 25) (17, 18) (7, 10) (7, 27) (7, 13) (21, 28) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 24) (20, 11) (25, 17) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 15) (8, 14) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 5) (15, 25) (6, 0) (28, 21) (28, 1) (1, 28) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 11) (26, 4) (9, 20) (9, 22) (22, 8) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 3) (24, 20) (24, 3) (24, 27) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 2) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 29) (19, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (16, 25) (16, 8) (16, 1) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 5) (18, 17) (18, 5) (29, 14) (29, 21) (29, 19) (5, 23) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 3) (11, 20) (11, 26) (11, 19) (11, 12) (3, 14) (3, 22) (3, 24) (3, 5) (10, 7) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
The graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. 
Let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 12, 5, 13}
- Node 1: {28, 26, 16}
- Node 2: {22, 27, 5}
- Node 3: {14, 22, 24, 5}
- Node 4: {26, 27}
- Node 5: {23, 2, 18, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {10, 27, 13}
- Node 8: {14, 23, 19, 16, 22}
- Node 9: {20, 22}
- Node 10: {7}
- Node 11: {20, 26, 19, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 11}
- Node 13: {7, 19, 0}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 29}
- Node 15: {25}
- Node 16: {25, 8, 1}
- Node 17: {25, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 5}
- Node 19: {8, 11, 29, 13}
- Node 20: {25, 9, 24, 11}
- Node 21: {28, 29}
- Node 22: {8, 9, 2, 3}
- Node 23: {8, 26, 5}
- Node 24: {20, 3, 27}
- Node 25: {17, 20, 16, 15}
- Node 26: {1, 23, 11, 4}
- Node 27: {7, 24, 4, 2}
- Node 28: {21, 1}
- Node 29: {14, 21, 19}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 14: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 26: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <14, (3, 8, 29)>
- <19, (8, 11, 29)>
- <26, (1, 23, 11)>
