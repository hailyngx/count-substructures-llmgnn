Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 9, 6, 4, 7
Node 1: 6, 4, 8
Node 2: 9, 8, 3
Node 3: 6, 8, 7, 2
Node 4: 6, 8, 0, 1
Node 5: 9, 6
Node 6: 5, 9, 1, 3, 4, 0
Node 7: 9, 8, 0, 3
Node 8: 4, 2, 3, 1, 7
Node 9: 5, 9, 6, 7, 0, 2

Now, let's determine how many 3-stars can be formed:

Node 6 and Node 9 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each.
Node 0, Node 3, and Node 8 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \), which we will represent as [52].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<6, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 7)>
<8, (4, 2, 3)>
