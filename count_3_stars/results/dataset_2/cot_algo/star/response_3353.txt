Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 35 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (7, 8, 9)>
