Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 8) (3, 18) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 1) (15, 0) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 6) (10, 14) (10, 2) (5, 16) (5, 4) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edge list by node:

- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 15), (0, 19), (0, 6)
- Node 1: (1, 11), (1, 15), (1, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 16), (2, 18), (2, 10), (2, 0)
- Node 3: (3, 18), (3, 13)
- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 5), (4, 6)
- Node 5: (5, 16), (5, 4)
- Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 0)
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 19), (7, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 18), (8, 19)
- Node 9: (9, 11), (9, 7), (9, 12)
- Node 10: (10, 14), (10, 2)
- Node 11: (11, 16), (11, 1), (11, 9)
- Node 12: (12, 4), (12, 19), (12, 9)
- Node 13: (13, 16), (13, 14), (13, 4), (13, 3)
- Node 14: (14, 18), (14, 13), (14, 10)
- Node 15: (15, 1), (15, 0)
- Node 16: (16, 11), (16, 13), (16, 2), (16, 5)
- Node 18: (18, 14), (18, 2), (18, 3), (18, 8)
- Node 19: (19, 7), (19, 8), (19, 0), (19, 12)

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 15, 19, 6
- Node 1 neighbors: 11, 15, 6
- Node 2 neighbors: 16, 18, 10, 0
- Node 3 neighbors: 18, 13
- Node 4 neighbors: 7, 12, 13, 5, 6
- Node 5 neighbors: 16, 4
- Node 6 neighbors: 4, 1, 0
- Node 7 neighbors: 4, 19, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 18, 19
- Node 9 neighbors: 11, 7, 12
- Node 10 neighbors: 14, 2
- Node 11 neighbors: 16, 1, 9
- Node 12 neighbors: 4, 19, 9
- Node 13 neighbors: 16, 14, 4, 3
- Node 14 neighbors: 18, 13, 10
- Node 15 neighbors: 1, 0
- Node 16 neighbors: 11, 13, 2, 5
- Node 18 neighbors: 14, 2, 3, 8
- Node 19 neighbors: 7, 8, 0, 12

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1, 10, 15
- Total number of 3-stars: 3

Therefore, in this graph, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <11, 1, 9>
- <2, 10, 14>
- <0, 15, 1>
