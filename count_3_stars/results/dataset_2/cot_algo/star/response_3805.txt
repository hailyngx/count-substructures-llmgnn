Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (22, 9) (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 23) (16, 20) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 1) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 4) (1, 18) (1, 25) (26, 10) (26, 28) (26, 8) (17, 29) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (29, 17) (29, 28) (29, 5) (28, 26) (28, 29) (28, 27) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 2) (6, 21) (6, 7) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (20, 16) (20, 18) (20, 19) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 25) (15, 14) (15, 19) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 12) (23, 16) (23, 18) (3, 19) (3, 24) (3, 5) (3, 8) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 12) (8, 26) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 27) (2, 9) (2, 27) (25, 1) (25, 14) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 19) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 8) (27, 2) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 21) (5, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list out all the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 8}
- Node 1: {18, 25}
- Node 2: {9, 27}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 19, 24}
- Node 4: {10, 17}
- Node 5: {3, 11, 17, 21, 29}
- Node 6: {7, 21}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 24, 26, 27}
- Node 9: {2, 17, 22}
- Node 10: {4, 11, 26}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 10, 14, 16}
- Node 12: {13, 19, 21, 24}
- Node 13: {12}
- Node 14: {11, 15, 25}
- Node 15: {14, 19}
- Node 16: {11, 18, 20, 23}
- Node 17: {4, 5, 9, 29}
- Node 18: {1, 16, 20, 23}
- Node 19: {12, 15, 20, 3}
- Node 20: {16, 18, 19}
- Node 21: {5, 6, 12}
- Node 22: {9}
- Node 23: {16, 18}
- Node 24: {12, 3, 8}
- Node 25: {1, 14}
- Node 26: {8, 10, 28}
- Node 27: {2, 8, 28}
- Node 28: {26, 27, 29}
- Node 29: {5, 17, 28}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the number of 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 46 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, 11, 17>, <5, 11, 21>, <5, 11, 29>, <5, 17, 21>, <5, 17, 29>, <5, 21, 29>, <8, 3, 24>, <8, 3, 26>, <8, 3, 27>, <8, 24, 26>, <8, 24, 27>, <8, 26, 27>, <11, 10, 16>, <11, 10, 26>, <11, 16, 18>, <11, 16, 23>, <11, 18, 20>, <12, 19, 21>, <12, 19, 24>, <14, 11, 15>, <16, 18, 20>, <17, 4, 5>, <18, 16, 20>, <18, 16, 23>, <18, 20, 23>.
