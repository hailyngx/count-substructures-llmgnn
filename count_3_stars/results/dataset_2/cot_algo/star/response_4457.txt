Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 2) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 4, 10}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 2: neighbors {10, 12, 14}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 6, 13}
- Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 5, 7, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 7: neighbors {5, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 8: neighbors {1, 4, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {4, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 10: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 11: neighbors {6, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 12: neighbors {2, 6, 11}
- Node 13: neighbors {3, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 14: neighbors {2, 9, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20 3-stars.
<10, (0, 1, 5)>, <10, (0, 1, 9)>, <10, (0, 1, 11)>, <10, (0, 5, 9)>, <10, (0, 5, 11)>, <10, (0, 9, 11)>, <10, (1, 5, 9)>, <10, (1, 5, 11)>, <10, (1, 9, 11)>, <10, (5, 9, 11)>, <10, (0, 1, 2)>, <10, (0, 1, 11)>, <10, (0, 2, 11)>, <10, (1, 2, 11)>, <10, (0, 5, 9)>, <10, (0, 5, 11)>, <10, (0, 9, 11)>, <10, (5, 9, 11)>, <10, (1, 5, 9)>, <10, (1, 5, 11)>

Node 6 also has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} \) = 20 3-stars.
<6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 13)>, <6, (3, 7, 13)>, <6, (5, 7, 13)>, <6, (3, 11, 12)>, <6, (3, 11, 13)>, <6, (3, 12, 13)>, <6, (11, 12, 13)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 13)>, <6, (5, 8, 13)>, <6, (7, 8, 13)>, <6, (7, 8, 13)>, <6, (5, 11, 12)>, <6, (5, 11, 13)>, <6, (5, 12, 13)>, <6, (11, 12, 13)>, <6, (7, 11, 12)>, <6, (7, 11, 13)>, <6, (7, 12, 13)>

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10 3-stars.
<1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 10)>, <1, (0, 5, 10)>, <1, (4, 5, 10)>, <1, (0, 8, 10)>, <1, (5, 8, 10)>, <1, (4, 8, 10)>

Adding up the 3-stars, we have 20 + 20 + 10 = 50 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [50].
