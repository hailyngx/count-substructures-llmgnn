Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 6) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9, 19}
- Node 1: Neighbors {10, 15, 17}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 13, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 9, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 9, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {12, 13, 15}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 11, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 9, 18}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 3}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 15, 16}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 7, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 17}
- Node 14: Neighbors {12}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1, 6, 11}
- Node 16: Neighbors {11, 17, 18}
- Node 17: Neighbors {1, 2, 13, 16, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbors {9, 16, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {0, 17, 18}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38] and the unique 3-star formations are:
<5, (0, 9, 13)>
<9, (0, 5, 18)>
<9, (3, 4, 18)>
<9, (3, 5, 18)>
<9, (4, 5, 18)>
<13, (2, 5, 17)>
<17, (1, 13, 19)>
<17, (2, 6, 13)>
<17, (2, 5, 13)>
<17, (2, 5, 19)>
