Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
Since the graph has 10 nodes, we need to determine the 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {9, 8, 6}
Node 1: {5, 9, 8}
Node 2: {5, 9, 6, 7}
Node 3: {7, 6, 4, 8}
Node 4: {9, 5, 3, 8}
Node 5: {6, 2, 1, 4}
Node 6: {5, 3, 8, 2, 0}
Node 7: {3, 8, 2}
Node 8: {1, 9, 3, 4, 0, 6, 7}
Node 9: {4, 1, 0, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
Node 5: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
Node 7: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: \(\binom{7}{3}\) = 35
Node 9: Not applicable (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 8, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (7, 6, 8)>, <4, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 2)>, <6, (3, 8, 4)>, <6, (8, 0, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 0)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 0, 7)>
