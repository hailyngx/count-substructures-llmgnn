Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Let's find the 3-star graphs:

Node 0: Neighbors {3, 7, 12}
Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 12}
Node 2: Neighbors {5, 8, 9, 10, 13}
Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7, 11, 13}
Node 4: Neighbors {3, 7, 8, 11, 13}
Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 8, 12, 14}
Node 6: Neighbors {1, 10}
Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 11, 12} (Forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 3, 12}: <7, (0, 3, 12)>)
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 4, 5}
Node 9: Neighbors {2, 11, 12, 14}
Node 10: Neighbors {2, 6, 11}
Node 11: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 9, 10}
Node 12: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 7, 9, 14} (Forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 5, 14}: <12, (1, 5, 14)>)
Node 13: Neighbors {2, 3, 4}
Node 14: Neighbors {5, 9, 12}

The total number of 3-stars is [2].
