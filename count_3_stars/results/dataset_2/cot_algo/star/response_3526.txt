Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 4) (27, 29) (27, 24) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 22) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 10) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 7) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 3) (20, 19) (20, 6) (29, 27) (29, 12) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 7) (19, 20) (19, 6) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 5) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 7) (6, 20) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 29) (12, 2) (5, 11) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 2) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 9) (25, 0) (25, 4) (25, 10) (14, 16) (14, 15) (7, 15) (7, 26) (7, 8) (7, 22) (7, 1) (10, 28) (10, 25) (0, 25) (0, 4) (0, 23) (17, 24) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 23) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 25) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) (23, 0) (23, 17) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {25, 4, 23}
- Node 1: {11, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {22, 12, 5}
- Node 3: {11, 18, 4}
- Node 4: {15, 3, 25, 0, 13}
- Node 5: {11, 21, 8, 2}
- Node 6: {20, 19, 1, 13, 2}
- Node 7: {15, 26, 8, 22, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 17, 7}
- Node 9: {21, 28, 25}
- Node 10: {28, 25}
- Node 11: {16, 3, 1, 18, 5}
- Node 12: {29, 2}
- Node 13: {6, 4}
- Node 14: {16, 15}
- Node 15: {7, 14, 4}
- Node 16: {11, 14}
- Node 17: {24, 18, 8, 23}
- Node 18: {11, 17, 3}
- Node 19: {20, 6}
- Node 20: {19, 6}
- Node 21: {9, 5, 22}
- Node 22: {21, 2, 7}
- Node 23: {0, 17}
- Node 24: {27, 26, 17}
- Node 25: {9, 0, 4, 10}
- Node 26: {28, 24, 7}
- Node 27: {29, 24}
- Node 28: {26, 9, 10}
- Node 29: {27, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 10: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 3 neighbors
- Node 21: 3 neighbors
- Node 22: 3 neighbors
- Node 24: 3 neighbors
- Node 25: 4 neighbors
- Node 26: 3 neighbors
- Node 28: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-star configurations:

- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \)
- Total number of 3-stars = \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 \)
- Total number of 3-stars = 56

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<4, (15, 0, 25)>
<5, (21, 2, 11)>
<6, (20, 19, 1)>
<7, (26, 22, 15)>
<8, (5, 17, 8)>
<9, (21, 28, 25)>
<10, (25, 28, 10)>
<11, (18, 1, 16)>
<15, (14, 15, 7)>
<17, (23, 24, 18)>
<18, (3, 11, 17)>
<21, (9, 5, 22)>
<22, (21, 7, 2)>
<24, (27, 26, 17)>
<25, (4, 10, 28)>
