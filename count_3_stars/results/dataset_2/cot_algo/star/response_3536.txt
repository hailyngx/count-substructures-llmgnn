Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7
- Node 4: 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 9, 2
- Node 9: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms [<0, 2, 5>, <0, 5, 9>]
- Node 1 forms no 3-stars as it only has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 forms [<2, 0, 5>, <2, 5, 8>]
- Node 7 forms no 3-stars as it only has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 forms [<8, 1, 9>, <8, 4, 1>, <8, 2, 5>, <8, 2, 7>]
- Node 9 forms [<9, 0, 5>, <9, 5, 1>, <9, 5, 6>, <9, 5, 8>]

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
