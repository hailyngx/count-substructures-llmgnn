Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
There are several nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 9.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [80].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
