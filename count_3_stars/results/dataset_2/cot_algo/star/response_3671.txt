Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 8) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 8) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (16, 8) (16, 5) (0, 18) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 5) (14, 10) (15, 0) (15, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (4, 15) (13, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 16) (5, 3) (5, 16) (5, 14)
