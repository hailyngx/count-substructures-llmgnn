Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 5, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <2, 3, 9>
- <7, 8, 1>
- <7, 8, 3>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <7, 1, 4>
- <8, 3, 9>
- <8, 1, 9>
- <8, 1, 7>
- <8, 1, 3>
- <8, 7, 9>
- <9, 0, 8>
- <9, 0, 2>
- <9, 0, 3>
- <9, 0, 5>
- <9, 2, 7>
- <9, 2, 3>
