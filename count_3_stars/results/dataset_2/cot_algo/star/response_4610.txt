Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 17) (9, 3) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 0) (6, 3) (14, 8) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {13, 3, 6}
- Node 1: {12, 13, 11, 10}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {9, 0, 6, 19, 5}
- Node 4: {18, 19, 10, 15}
- Node 5: {18, 3, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 3}
- Node 7: {12, 16, 19, 18}
- Node 8: {2, 14, 17}
- Node 9: {3}
- Node 10: {4, 1, 5}
- Node 11: {17, 1, 19}
- Node 12: {7, 16, 13, 1}
- Node 13: {12, 1, 0}
- Node 14: {8}
- Node 15: {4, 17}
- Node 16: {7, 12, 17}
- Node 17: {8, 17, 15, 11}
- Node 18: {4, 7, 5}
- Node 19: {7, 4, 3, 11}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 15: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 18: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 35

Therefore, there are 35 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 6>, <1, 10, 11>, <1, 10, 13>, <1, 11, 19>, <1, 12, 13>, <3, 4, 5>, <4, 7, 18>, <7, 16, 17>, <8, 14, 17>, <12, 13, 1>, <12, 16, 17>, <13, 0, 3>, <13, 1, 12>, <17, 11, 19>, <17, 15, 4>, <18, 4, 5>, <19, 7, 4>, <19, 11, 1>
