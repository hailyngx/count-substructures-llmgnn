Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 0) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 9) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 19) (14, 8) (18, 17) (18, 0) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 18) (0, 9) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, we will build the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 9, 18, 19}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 8, 13}
- Node 2: {10, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {5, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 14, 19}
- Node 9: {0, 13, 16}
- Node 10: {2, 16, 17}
- Node 11: {2, 4}
- Node 12: {4, 16, 17}
- Node 13: {1, 9, 19}
- Node 14: {8}
- Node 15: {6, 7, 16}
- Node 16: {9, 10, 12, 15}
- Node 17: {10, 12, 18}
- Node 18: {0, 17}
- Node 19: {0, 6, 7, 8, 13}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4]
- Node 1: [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10]
- Node 4: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1]
- Node 6: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1]
- Node 8: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4]
- Node 9: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1]
- Node 10: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1]
- Node 12: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1]
- Node 16: [\( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4]
- Node 17: [\( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1]
- Node 18: [\( \binom{2}{3} \) = 0]
- Node 19: [\( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10]

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 10 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (4, 9, 18)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 8, 13)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 13)>
- <1, (5, 7, 19)>
- <1, (6, 8, 13)>
- <4, (0, 11, 12)>
- <6, (1, 15, 19)>
- <8, (3, 14, 19)>
- <9, (0, 13, 16)>
- <16, (9, 10, 15)>
- <16, (9, 12, 15)>
- <16, (10, 12, 15)>
- <16, (10, 15, 17)>
- <19, (6, 7, 13)>
- <19, (6, 7, 8)>
- <19, (6, 8, 13)>
