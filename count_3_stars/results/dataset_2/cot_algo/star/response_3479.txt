Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7
- Node 5: 3, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54 
Therefore, the final answer is [54].

Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <7, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 6, 8)>
