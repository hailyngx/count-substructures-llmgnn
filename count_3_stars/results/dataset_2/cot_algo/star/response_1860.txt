Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 11) (11, 8) (11, 2) (14, 5) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 10}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 8}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {5}

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars, we get 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 = 58.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 8, 12)>
- <4, (5, 8, 13)>
- <6, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (2, 8, 11)>
- <8, (2, 6, 11)>
- <12, (0, 8, 13)>
