Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 18) (27, 20) (10, 15) (17, 20) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 13) (23, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 25) (2, 4) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 21) (26, 22) (26, 5) (28, 15) (20, 27) (20, 17) (20, 18) (20, 9) (16, 12) (16, 18) (5, 26) (19, 6) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 21) (29, 6) (29, 14) (29, 11) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 19) (6, 29) (6, 1) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 16) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 14) (0, 15) (0, 24) (3, 8) (3, 23) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 13) (14, 8) (14, 29) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 25) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 24) (21, 25) (11, 22) (11, 29) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (25, 2) (25, 14) (25, 21) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {15, 24}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 25}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 8, 23}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {26}
- Node 6: {1, 19, 29}
- Node 7: {3, 13, 24}
- Node 8: {3, 12, 14, 23}
- Node 9: {20, 21, 23}
- Node 10: {15}
- Node 11: {22, 29}
- Node 12: {8, 14, 16}
- Node 13: {7, 14, 23}
- Node 14: {8, 13, 25, 29}
- Node 15: {0, 18, 27, 28}
- Node 16: {12, 18}
- Node 17: {20}
- Node 18: {15, 16, 20, 27}
- Node 19: {6}
- Node 20: {9, 17, 27}
- Node 21: {9, 21, 24, 27, 25}
- Node 22: {21, 26}
- Node 23: {3, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 24: {0, 7, 21}
- Node 25: {2, 14, 21}
- Node 26: {5, 22}
- Node 27: {15, 18, 20, 21}
- Node 28: {15}
- Node 29: {6, 11, 14}

Next, we will identify which nodes can form a 3-star:

- Nodes forming a 3-star: 15, 18, 27, 8, 23, 14, 21

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{15}{3} + \binom{18}{3} + \binom{27}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{23}{3} + \binom{14}{3} + \binom{21}{3} = 455 + 816 + 2925 + 56 + 177 + 364 + 1330 = 6073 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6073].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
1. <15, (0, 18, 27)>
2. <18, (15, 16, 20)>
3. <27, (15, 18, 20)>
4. <8, (3, 12, 23)>
5. <23, (8, 9, 13)>
6. <14, (8, 25, 29)>
7. <21, (9, 24, 27)>
