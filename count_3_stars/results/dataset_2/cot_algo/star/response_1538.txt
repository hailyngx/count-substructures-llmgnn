Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {11, 14, 5, 6, 9, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {10, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 8, 13, 1, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 12, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {11, 13, 0, 14, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 0, 1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {11, 6, 10, 9, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 2, 14, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 0, 14, 2}
- Node 10: Neighbors {7, 11, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors {7, 10, 0, 13, 5}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {11, 5, 2}
- Node 14: Neighbors {8, 0, 9, 12, 5}

Next, we check for nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 74

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [74].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <0, (5, 9, 14)>
- <0, (6, 1, 5)>
- <0, (9, 7, 14)>
- <0, (11, 5, 13)>
- <2, (7, 8, 13)>
- <5, (0, 11, 14)>
- <7, (6, 9, 10)>
- <7, (9, 10, 11)>
- <7, (10, 11, 13)>
- <11, (0, 5, 13)>
- <14, (5, 9, 12)>
