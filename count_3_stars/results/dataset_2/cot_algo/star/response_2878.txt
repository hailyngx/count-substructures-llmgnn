Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 5) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 13) (29, 23) (20, 7) (20, 9) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 17) (26, 19) (26, 23) (21, 28) (21, 3) (28, 21) (28, 16) (9, 20) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 16) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 3) (11, 19) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 6) (8, 9) (8, 25) (18, 19) (18, 9) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 22) (3, 23) (0, 4) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (23, 29) (23, 26) (23, 3) (23, 25) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 24) (24, 22) (24, 1) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 27) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 25) (14, 12) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 25) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 17) (13, 29) (13, 10) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 7) (25, 6) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5}
Node 1: Neighbors {15, 24, 7}
Node 2: Neighbors {29, 5, 19}
Node 3: Neighbors {27, 21, 22, 23}
Node 4: Neighbors {0, 5, 17}
Node 5: Neighbors {2, 27, 0, 4}
Node 6: Neighbors {16, 10, 7, 25}
Node 7: Neighbors {27, 20, 1, 6, 25}
Node 8: Neighbors {25, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {20, 22, 8, 18, 16}
Node 10: Neighbors {6, 12, 13}
Node 11: Neighbors {19}
Node 12: Neighbors {10, 14, 17}
Node 13: Neighbors {29, 10}
Node 14: Neighbors {12}
Node 15: Neighbors {1, 27}
Node 16: Neighbors {28, 6, 9}
Node 17: Neighbors {4, 12, 19}
Node 18: Neighbors {19, 9}
Node 19: Neighbors {2, 26, 18, 11, 17}
Node 20: Neighbors {7, 9}
Node 21: Neighbors {28, 3}
Node 22: Neighbors {9, 24, 25, 3}
Node 23: Neighbors {29, 26, 3, 25}
Node 24: Neighbors {22, 1}
Node 25: Neighbors {8, 22, 23, 7, 6}
Node 26: Neighbors {19, 23}
Node 27: Neighbors {15, 3, 7, 5}
Node 28: Neighbors {21, 16}
Node 29: Neighbors {2, 23, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes forming 3-star: {15, 27, 2, 5, 3, 7, 9, 6, 1, 19, 25, 29}

For each of these nodes, there is one 3-star formed:
Total number of 3-stars = [12]

Unique 3-stars:
<15, (1, 7, 27)>
<27, (3, 7, 15)>
<2, (5, 19, 29)>
<5, (0, 4, 27)>
<3, (21, 22, 27)>
<7, (1, 6, 25)>
<9, (16, 18, 20)>
<6, (7, 10, 25)>
<1, (7, 15, 24)>
<19, (17, 11, 18)>
<25, (6, 7, 22)>
<29, (13, 2, 23)>
