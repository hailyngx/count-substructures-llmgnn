Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node that has three or more neighbors. Then we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of unique 3-stars centered at that node. 

For the given graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, here is the analysis:

Node 4 has 3 neighbors (19, 23, 11). So, it can form one 3-star. 
Node 7 has 3 neighbors (28, 18, 9). So, it can form one 3-star. 
Node 14 has 4 neighbors (17, 6, 24, 25). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 17 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 5 has 3 neighbors (6, 18, 27). So, it can form one 3-star. 
Node 6 has 3 neighbors (14, 5, 3). So, it can form one 3-star. 
Node 28 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 29 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 19 has 4 neighbors (26, 22, 2). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 26 has 4 neighbors (18, 15, 12, 19). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 9 has 4 neighbors (22, 2, 21, 7). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 22 has 4 neighbors (19, 9, 16, 0). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 18 has 5 neighbors (7, 5, 26, 23, 15). So, it can form 10 unique 3-stars. 
Node 20 has 4 neighbors (29, 3, 13, 27). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 10 has 4 neighbors (21, 3, 8, 1). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 21 has 4 neighbors (9, 10, 11, 24). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 25 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 11 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 2 has 3 neighbors (19, 9, 25). So, it can form one 3-star. 
Node 13 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 15 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 3 has 3 neighbors (6, 20, 10). So, it can form one 3-star. 
Node 24 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 23 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 1 has 3 neighbors (16, 10, 0). So, it can form one 3-star. 
Node 8 has 4 neighbors (10, 12, 27, 8). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 12 has 3 neighbors (17, 26, 8). So, it can form one 3-star. 
Node 27 has 4 neighbors (5, 20, 13, 8). So, it can form 4 unique 3-stars. 
Node 0 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 
Node 16 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star. 

Adding up the number of unique 3-stars formed by each node: 
1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 51

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
