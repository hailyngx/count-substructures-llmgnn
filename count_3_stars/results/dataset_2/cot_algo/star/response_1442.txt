Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 have 5 neighbors
- Node 3, 5, 6, 8 have 3 neighbors

For nodes with 5 neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
\( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For nodes with 3 neighbors, we can't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
