Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 12) (15, 11) (27, 22) (27, 14) (27, 20) (27, 19) (11, 15) (11, 21) (11, 17) (22, 27) (22, 23) (22, 5) (22, 25) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 1) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 28) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 24) (0, 23) (0, 16) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 24) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 26) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 17) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 7) (9, 25) (29, 19) (29, 13) (24, 6) (24, 14) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 12) (12, 15) (12, 23) (12, 26) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 26) (7, 19) (7, 13) (7, 17) (17, 11) (17, 28) (17, 7) (25, 22) (25, 9) (25, 13) (25, 4) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 4) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 4) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 25) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 4) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 21) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {23, 16}
- Node 1: {18, 12, 4}
- Node 2: {18, 20, 21, 14}
- Node 3: {8, 26}
- Node 4: {25, 20, 21, 1}
- Node 5: {22, 6, 19, 28}
- Node 6: {18, 5, 24}
- Node 7: {19, 13, 17}
- Node 8: {22, 3}
- Node 9: {25}
- Node 11: {15, 21, 17}
- Node 12: {23, 15, 26, 1}
- Node 13: {29, 7, 25}
- Node 14: {27, 2, 24}
- Node 15: {12, 11}
- Node 16: {0, 28, 26}
- Node 17: {11, 7, 28}
- Node 18: {2, 19, 6, 1}
- Node 19: {27, 5, 29, 7, 18}
- Node 20: {27, 2, 4}
- Node 21: {11, 2, 4}
- Node 22: {27, 23, 5, 25, 8}
- Node 23: {22, 0, 12}
- Node 24: {6, 14}
- Node 25: {22, 13, 9, 4}
- Node 26: {16, 3, 12}
- Node 27: {22, 14, 20, 19}
- Node 28: {5, 16, 17}
- Node 29: {19, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 18, Node 19, Node 20, Node 21, Node 22, Node 25, Node 27, and Node 28 all have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 49 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (18, 20, 21)>
<4, (20, 2, 21)>
<5, (22, 6, 19)>
<6, (18, 5, 24)>
<7, (19, 13, 17)>
<11, (15, 21, 17)>
<12, (23, 15, 26)>
<13, (29, 7, 25)>
<18, (2, 19, 6)>
<19, (27, 5, 29)>
<20, (27, 2, 4)>
<21, (11, 2, 4)>
<22, (27, 23, 5)>
<25, (22, 13, 9)>
<27, (22, 14, 20)>
<28, (5, 16, 17)>
