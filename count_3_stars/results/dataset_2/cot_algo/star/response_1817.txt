Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node:

Node 0: 6 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 2: 6 edges
Node 3: 4 edges
Node 4: 3 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 6: 5 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 10: 4 edges
Node 11: 4 edges
Node 12: 4 edges
Node 13: 4 edges
Node 14: 5 edges

Identifying the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 9, 10}
Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 10}
Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 11}
Node 4: {2, 6, 14}
Node 5: {0, 3, 7, 8}
Node 6: {2, 4, 13, 14}
Node 7: {1, 5, 12, 13}
Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 11}
Node 9: {0, 2, 12}
Node 10: {0, 1, 11, 14}
Node 11: {3, 8, 10, 13}
Node 12: {6, 7, 9}
Node 13: {6, 7, 11, 14}
Node 14: {4, 6, 10, 13}

Identifying the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 53 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 10)>, <0, (3, 5, 10)>, <0, (5, 9, 10)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 14)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 13)>, <6, (4, 13, 14)>, <7, (1, 5, 13)>, <8, (1, 3, 11)>, <10, (0, 11, 14)>, <11, (3, 8, 13)>, <13, (6, 7, 14)>, <14, (4, 10, 13)>
