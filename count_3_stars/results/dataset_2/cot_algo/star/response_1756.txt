Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 11, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 12, 13}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbor {12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 3, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 11, 12}

Now, let's check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed with only 4 neighbors
- Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed with only 3 neighbors
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed with only 3 neighbors
- Node 6: No 3-stars can be formed with only 4 neighbors
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed with only 3 neighbors
- Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed with only 2 neighbors
- Node 10: No 3-stars can be formed with only 1 neighbor
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 62\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [62].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 2, 6>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 11, 13>
- <1, 7, 12>
- <1, 11, 13>
- <1, 12, 14>
- <1, 11, 14>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <4, 12, 14>
- <4, 11, 14>
- <4, 12, 7>
- <4, 5, 14>
- <7, 11, 3>
- <11, 14, 3>
- <11, 14, 4>
- <11, 3, 14>
- <12, 4, 14>
- <12, 14, 11>
