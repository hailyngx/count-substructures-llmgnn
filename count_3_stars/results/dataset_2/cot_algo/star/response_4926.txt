Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's go through each node to identify its neighbors:

1. Node 0: Neighbors are [7, 12, 3, 5]
2. Node 1: Neighbors are [12, 11, 14, 5]
3. Node 2: Neighbors are [6, 4]
4. Node 3: Neighbors are [6, 8, 12, 0, 10]
5. Node 4: Neighbors are [5, 11, 2]
6. Node 5: Neighbors are [4, 8, 0, 10, 1]
7. Node 6: Neighbors are [9, 7, 3, 2, 13]
8. Node 7: Neighbors are [6, 9, 8, 12, 0]
9. Node 8: Neighbors are [5, 14, 3, 7]
10. Node 9: Neighbors are [6, 11, 14, 7]
11. Node 10: Neighbors are [3, 13, 5, 14]
12. Node 11: Neighbors are [9, 4, 1]
13. Node 12: Neighbors are [7, 0, 3, 1]
14. Node 13: Neighbors are [6, 10, 14]
15. Node 14: Neighbors are [9, 8, 10, 1, 13]

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 6: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 7: [5 choose 3] = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: [3 choose 3] = 1 3-star
- Node 12: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: [4 choose 3] = 4 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars calculated, we get a total of 62 3-stars.

Therefore, the result to be presented is [62]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (7, 12, 3)>
- <1, (12, 11, 14)>
- <1, (12, 14, 5)>
- <1, (11, 14, 5)>
- <1, (10, 14, 5)>
- <3, (6, 8, 12)>
- <3, (6, 0, 10)>
- <3, (8, 12, 0)>
- <3, (8, 12, 7)>
- <3, (0, 5, 10)>
- <5, (4, 8, 10)>
- <5, (4, 0, 10)>
- <5, (4, 1, 10)>
- <5, (8, 0, 1)>
- <6, (9, 7, 2)>
- <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- <6, (3, 2, 13)>
- <7, (9, 8, 12)>
- <7, (9, 0, 12)>
- <7, (9, 0, 5)>
- <7, (8, 12, 0)>
- <8, (5, 14, 1)>
- <9, (6, 11, 14)>
- <9, (11, 4, 2)>
- <10, (3, 13, 14)>
- <11, (9, 4, 1)>
- <12, (7, 0, 3)>
- <14, (9, 8, 10)>
- <14, (9, 1, 13)>
