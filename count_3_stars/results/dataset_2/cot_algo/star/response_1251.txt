Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 7

Now let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: In this case, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: In this case, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: In this case, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: In this case, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: In this case, \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: In this case, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: In this case, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: In this case, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: In this case, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: In this case, \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 44 3-stars. So, the final answer is [44].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 5, 7, 9>
<0, 5, 7, 4>
<0, 5, 8, 4>
<0, 7, 6, 1>
