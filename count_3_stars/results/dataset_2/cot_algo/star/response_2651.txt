Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 6}
- Node 3: {9, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 1, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 1, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 4, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 6, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 3, 1, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 63

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [63]. 

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 9, 3)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <3, (9, 6, 8)>
- <4, (7, 1, 6)>
- <6, (9, 4, 1)>
- <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- <8, (7, 6, 3)>
- <9, (6, 3, 1)>
