Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 12) (10, 3) (10, 5) (15, 12) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 5) (9, 18) (9, 11) (19, 6) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
The graph is as follows:

<graph> 
20 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
60 edges: (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (17, 4) (...2) (15, 12) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 5) (9, 18) (9, 11) (19, 6) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the neighborhood of each node:

Node 0: {14, 11}
Node 1: {16, 13}
Node 2: {18, 6, 11}
Node 3: {14, 7, 10, 13, 5}
Node 4: {8, 18, 14, 17}
Node 5: {8, 12, 10, 16, 3}
Node 6: {8, 2, 13, 19}
Node 7: {12, 3}
Node 8: {4, 5, 6}
Node 9: {18, 11}
Node 10: {3, 5}
Node 11: {2, 0, 9}
Node 12: {7, 5, 17, 15}
Node 13: {18, 1, 3, 6}
Node 14: {4, 0, 3, 16}
Node 15: {12}
Node 16: {14, 1, 5}
Node 17: {4, 12}
Node 18: {4, 2, 9, 13}
Node 19: {6}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44].
