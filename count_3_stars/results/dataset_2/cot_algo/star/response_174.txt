Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (15, 28) (4, 7) (4, 23) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 28) (7, 13) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 24) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 9) (27, 20) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 2) (25, 0) (25, 20) (2, 10) (2, 20) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 29) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 9) (22, 1) (1, 17) (1, 22) (1, 5) (1, 19) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 21) (28, 15) (28, 7) (28, 9) (28, 16) (23, 4) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 12) (26, 23) (26, 5) (5, 1) (5, 26) (21, 16) (21, 29) (12, 14) (12, 23) (12, 24) (6, 29) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 24) (29, 8) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 13) (29, 18) (18, 14) (18, 29) (18, 13) (24, 17) (24, 12) (24, 19) (24, 13) (13, 7) (13, 29) (13, 18) (13, 24) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 11, 25}
- Node 1: {5, 17, 19, 22}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 19, 20}
- Node 3: {9, 10}
- Node 4: {7, 23}
- Node 5: {1, 26}
- Node 6: {29}
- Node 7: {4, 13, 16, 28}
- Node 8: {2, 8, 11, 29}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 11, 22, 28}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 11, 19}
- Node 11: {0, 8, 9, 10, 23}
- Node 12: {14, 23, 24}
- Node 13: {7, 18, 24, 29}
- Node 14: {12, 18}
- Node 15: {28}
- Node 16: {7, 21, 28}
- Node 17: {1, 24}
- Node 18: {13, 14, 29}
- Node 19: {1, 10, 19, 24}
- Node 20: {2, 25, 27}
- Node 21: {16, 29}
- Node 22: {1, 9}
- Node 23: {4, 11, 12, 26}
- Node 24: {12, 13, 17, 19}
- Node 25: {0, 20}
- Node 26: {5, 23}
- Node 27: {20}
- Node 28: {7, 9, 15, 16}
- Node 29: {6, 8, 13, 18, 21}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 9, Node 11, Node 13, Node 16, Node 18, Node 19, and Node 24 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 37 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

Unique 3-star configurations are:
- <9, 0, 3>
- <9, 0, 11>
- <9, 0, 25>
- <9, 3, 10>
- <9, 11, 10>
- <11, 0, 8>
- <11, 0, 25>
- <11, 3, 10>
- <11, 23, 4>
- <13, 7, 28>
- <13, 18, 29>
- <13, 24, 19>
- <13, 24, 17>
- <16, 7, 28>
- <18, 14, 12>
- <18, 14, 29>
- <18, 14, 13>
- <19, 1, 10>
- <19, 1, 24>
- <19, 10, 2>
- <19, 24, 17>
- <24, 17, 1>
- <24, 17, 19>
- <24, 17, 13>
- <24, 19, 1>
- <24, 19, 13>
