Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 25) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 26) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 3) (27, 12) (27, 25) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 8) (15, 18) (15, 20) (20, 12) (20, 15) (20, 3) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 14) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 4) (9, 24) (9, 1) (26, 21) (26, 28) (26, 23) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 9) (8, 18) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 10) (23, 26) (23, 16) (16, 19) (16, 23) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 5) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 11) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 20) (11, 22) (11, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (6, 22) (24, 9) (24, 14) (24, 10) (14, 28) (14, 24) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 2) (10, 25) (10, 24) (10, 14) (10, 5)

Considering nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 1, 10, and 18 have 3 neighbors or more, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. (For example, <10, 2, 25>, <10, 2, 24>, <10, 2, 14>, <10, 25, 24>, <10, 25, 14>, <10, 24, 14>, <10, 5, 14>, <10, 5, 24>, <10, 5, 17>, <10, 14, 24>)
- Node 18 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. (For example, <18, 2, 17>, <18, 2, 3>, <18, 2, 8>, <18, 17, 3>, <18, 17, 8>, <18, 3, 8>, <18, 15, 20>, <18, 15, 3>, <18, 20, 3>, <18, 17, 19>)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 10 = 21
So, the answer is [21].
