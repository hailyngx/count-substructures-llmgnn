Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {7, 3, 2, 8}
- Node 1 neighbors: {5, 9, 7, 3, 8}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 0}
- Node 3 neighbors: {6, 4, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 4 neighbors: {2, 3}
- Node 5 neighbors: {9, 2, 8, 1}
- Node 6 neighbors: {9, 3, 2}
- Node 7 neighbors: {0, 3, 2, 1}
- Node 8 neighbors: {5, 1, 2, 0}
- Node 9 neighbors: {5, 6, 1}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars:
  - <0, (7, 3, 8)>

- Node 1 forms 3-stars:
  - <1, (5, 9, 7)>
  - <1, (5, 3, 8)>

- Node 2 forms 3-stars:
  - <2, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <2, (5, 4, 8)>
  - <2, (5, 7, 8)>
  - <2, (6, 4, 3)>
  - <2, (6, 7, 3)>

- Node 3 forms 3-stars:
  - <3, (6, 4, 2)>
  - <3, (7, 1, 0)>
  - <3, (7, 2, 0)>

- Node 5 forms 3-stars:
  - <5, (9, 6, 1)>
  - <5, (9, 2, 8)>
  - <5, (9, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (6, 2, 8)>
  - <5, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 8 forms 3-stars:
  - <8, (5, 1, 0)>
  - <8, (5, 2, 0)>
  - <8, (5, 7, 0)>

There are a total of 15 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [15].
