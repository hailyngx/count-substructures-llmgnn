Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.

Therefore, the final answer is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 2)>
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
