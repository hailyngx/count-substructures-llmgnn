Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 1) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 8, 9, 11, 14 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 (5 neighbors)
- Node 2: 5 (1 neighbor)
- Node 3: 5, 6, 9, 12 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4: 6, 10, 11 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5: 2, 3, 8, 12, 14 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 7, 14 (5 neighbors)
- Node 7: 6, 9 (2 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0, 1, 5, 14 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7, 10, 11, 13 (6 neighbors)
- Node 10: 1, 4, 9, 12, 13 (5 neighbors)
- Node 11: 0, 4, 9 (3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 1, 3, 5, 10, 14 (5 neighbors)
- Node 13: 9, 10 (2 neighbors)
- Node 14: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 12 (6 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars originated from each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 112

Therefore, the final answer is [112].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 9, 14>, <1, 5, 12, 14>, <1, 6, 12, 14>, <1, 10, 12, 14>, <1, 10, 13, 14>, <3, 9, 12, 14>, <5, 8, 12, 14>, <5, 12, 14, 2>, <5, 12, 14, 3>, <5, 8, 14, 12>, <6, 1, 12, 14>, <6, 1, 10, 14>, <6, 3, 14, 12>, <6, 4, 14, 12>, <8, 5, 12, 14>, <0, 9, 14>, <0, 11, 14>, <9, 11, 14>, <9, 10, 14>, <9, 13, 14>, <0, 8, 14>, <3, 5, 14>, <10, 1, 14>, <10, 4, 14>, <1, 8, 14>, <3, 9, 14>, <9, 7, 14>, <2, 5, 14>, <10, 12, 14>
