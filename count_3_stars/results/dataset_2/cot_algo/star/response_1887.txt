Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}

Now let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 5, and 6: <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, and 7: <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 5, and 9: <6, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, and 7: <9, (5, 6, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is 4, so the final answer is [4].
