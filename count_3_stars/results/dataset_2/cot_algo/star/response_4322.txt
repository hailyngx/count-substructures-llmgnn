Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 9, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 5, 9, 8
- Node 2: 6, 7
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 9, 6, 8, 1, 7
- Node 6: 5, 9, 3, 2, 4, 0
- Node 7: 5, 9, 4, 0, 2
- Node 8: 5, 9, 1, 3, 0
- Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 1, 7, 0

Now, let's check which nodes can form 3-stars:
- Node 0 and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each. Calculate \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, and Node 8 have 5 neighbors each. Calculate \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 = 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 5, 6)>
