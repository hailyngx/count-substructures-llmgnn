Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5
- Node 7: 0, 5, 8
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 8

Now let's find the number of 3-stars present in the graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, 1, 3, 6>
- <0, 1, 3, 2>
- <0, 1, 3, 4>
- <0, 1, 4, 2>
- <0, 1, 4, 3>
- <0, 1, 6, 5>
- <0, 3, 8, 9>
- <0, 3, 8, 4>
- <0, 3, 9, 2>
- <0, 3, 9, 4>
- <0, 4, 8, 9>
- <0, 4, 8, 3>
- <0, 4, 9, 3>
- <0, 4, 2, 9>
- <1, 0, 3, 2>
- <1, 0, 3, 4>
- <1, 0, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 8, 9>
- <1, 3, 4, 2>
- <1, 3, 4, 0>
- <1, 3, 9, 2>
- <1, 4, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 3, 2>
- <1, 4, 3, 0>
- <2, 3, 4, 8>
- <2, 3, 4, 0>
- <2, 3, 9, 1>
- <2, 3, 9, 4>
- <2, 4, 8, 9>
- <3, 0, 4, 8>
- <3, 0, 4, 9>
- <3, 0, 9, 2>
- <3, 4, 8, 9>
