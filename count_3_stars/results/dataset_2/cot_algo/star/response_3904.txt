Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 9) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 21) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 6) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 24) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 4) (20, 0) (20, 19) (1, 22) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 17) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 2) (6, 12) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 16) (19, 20) (19, 5) (19, 29) (17, 13) (17, 26) (17, 29) (29, 19) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 14) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (5, 19) (5, 7) (5, 4) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 11) (25, 11) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 2) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 24) (21, 22) (21, 23) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 25) (11, 24) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 16) (24, 11) (10, 26) (10, 18) (2, 6) (2, 27) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 18) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {20, 14, 4}
- Node 1: {22, 26, 16}
- Node 2: {6, 27}
- Node 3: {15, 27, 9}
- Node 4: {23, 0, 5}
- Node 5: {19, 7, 4}
- Node 6: {8, 28, 2, 12}
- Node 7: {9, 12, 5}
- Node 8: {9, 28, 6}
- Node 9: {3, 15, 22, 8, 7}
- Node 10: {26, 18}
- Node 11: {13, 18, 25, 24}
- Node 12: {6, 7}
- Node 13: {17, 11, 24}
- Node 14: {0, 29, 18}
- Node 15: {3, 9}
- Node 16: {1, 28, 24}
- Node 17: {13, 26, 29}
- Node 18: {10, 11, 14}
- Node 19: {20, 5, 29}
- Node 20: {0, 19}
- Node 21: {22, 23}
- Node 22: {23, 9, 1, 24, 21}
- Node 23: {22, 4, 21}
- Node 24: {22, 13, 16, 11}
- Node 25: {11}
- Node 26: {1, 10, 17}
- Node 27: {3, 29, 2}
- Node 28: {8, 6, 16}
- Node 29: {19, 17, 14, 27}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 4 = 24 3-stars. So, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <9, (3, 15, 22, 8)>
- <9, (3, 15, 22, 7)>
- <9, (3, 27, 29, 7)>
- <9, (3, 27, 29, 14)>
- <9, (15, 3, 27, 29)>
- <22, (23, 4, 5, 19)>
- <22, (23, 21, 1, 26)>
- <22, (9, 3, 15, 27)>
- <22, (9, 3, 15, 28)>
- <22, (9, 23, 21, 1)>
- <22, (9, 23, 21, 24)>
- <22, (9, 23, 4, 5)>
- <29, (19, 5, 4, 0)>
- <29, (19, 5, 7, 12)>
- <29, (19, 5, 7, 14)>
- <29, (19, 20, 0, 14)>
- <9, (22, 1, 26, 17)>
- <9, (22, 21, 23, 4)>
- <9, (22, 21, 23, 21)>
- <9, (22, 21, 23, 22)>
- <22, (9, 15, 3, 27)>
- <22, (9, 15, 3, 29)>
- <22, (9, 15, 27, 29)>
- <22, (9, 15, 27, 2)>
- <22, (9, 23, 21, 22)>
