Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors:
  - Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 9}. <0, (1, 2, 9)>

As there is only one unique 3-star in this graph, the total number of 3-stars is [1].
