Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 7, 10, 11, 12  
Node 1: 4, 6, 10, 13, 14  
Node 2: 3, 5, 11, 12, 13  
Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 13  
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7, 11  
Node 5: 2  
Node 6: 1, 3, 10  
Node 7: 4, 10, 14  
Node 8: 9, 13  
Node 9: 8, 14  
Node 10: 0, 1, 6, 7, 13  
Node 11: 0, 2, 4, 13, 14  
Node 12: 0, 2, 14  
Node 13: 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 11  
Node 14: 1, 7, 9, 11, 12  

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.  
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.  

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of 70 3-stars in this graph.  

The unique 3-star configurations are:
