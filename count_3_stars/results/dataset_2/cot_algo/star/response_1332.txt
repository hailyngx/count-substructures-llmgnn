Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 17) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 11) (17, 16) (17, 7) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 18) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 7) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 1
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 3

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
  - <3, (16, 19, 18)>
  - <3, (16, 0, 19)>
  - <3, (16, 0, 8)>
  - <3, (19, 18, 8)>
  
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
  - <6, (5, 9, 10)>
  - <6, (5, 9, 18)>
  - <6, (9, 10, 18)>
  - <6, (5, 10, 18)>

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
  - <9, (5, 6, 15)>
  - <9, (5, 6, 11)>
  - <9, (5, 15, 11)>
  - <9, (6, 15, 11)>

- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star:
  - <12, (0, 2, 14)>

- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars:
  - <14, (8, 2, 11)>
  - <14, (8, 2, 12)>
  - <14, (8, 2, 14)>
  - <14, (8, 11, 12)>

After identifying all the unique 3-stars, we can see that a total of 21 3-stars are formed in this graph.
Therefore, the final answer is [21].
