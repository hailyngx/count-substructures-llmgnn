Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to determine the neighbors of each node first.

Here are the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up these numbers, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 54 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [54].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 5, 6>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 6>, <1, 2, 9>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <5, 6, 9>.
