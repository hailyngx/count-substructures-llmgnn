Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three neighbors in this graph: nodes 4, 6, and 8. 

For node 4:
- Neighbor set: {0, 1, 6, 13, 14}
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
    - <4, (0, 1, 13)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 14)>
    - <4, (0, 13, 14)>
    - <4, (1, 13, 14)>
    - <4, (0, 1, 6)>
    - <4, (0, 6, 14)>
    - <4, (0, 13, 6)>
    - <4, (13, 14, 6)>
    - <4, (1, 13, 6)>
    - <4, (1, 14, 6)>

For node 6:
- Neighbor set: {4, 9, 12, 13, 3}
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
    - <6, (4, 9, 12)>
    - <6, (4, 12, 13)>
    - <6, (4, 13, 3)>
    - <6, (4, 12, 3)>
    - <6, (4, 9, 13)>
    - <6, (9, 12, 13)>
    - <6, (9, 13, 3)>
    - <6, (9, 12, 3)>
    - <6, (4, 9, 3)>
    - <6, (12, 13, 3)>

For node 8:
- Neighbor set: {0, 2, 11, 12, 13}
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: 
    - <8, (0, 2, 11)>
    - <8, (0, 2, 12)>
    - <8, (0, 2, 13)>
    - <8, (0, 11, 12)>
    - <8, (0, 11, 13)>
    - <8, (0, 12, 13)>
    - <8, (2, 11, 12)>
    - <8, (2, 11, 13)>
    - <8, (2, 12, 13)>
    - <8, (11, 12, 13)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 30. Thus, the final answer is [30].
