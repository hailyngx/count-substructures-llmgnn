Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 6) (18, 17) (18, 29) (22, 27) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 15) (28, 20) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 12) (15, 28) (16, 20) (11, 23) (11, 21) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 13) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 26) (3, 28) (3, 12) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 20) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 7) (25, 8) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 14) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 21) (21, 11) (21, 13) (21, 24) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 25) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 14) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 24) (24, 21) (24, 7) (24, 20) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 29) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 12) (20, 28) (20, 16) (20, 10) (20, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 19, 27
- Node 1: 0, 6, 14, 26
- Node 2: 4, 9, 14
- Node 3: 8, 12, 26, 28
- Node 4: 2, 13
- Node 5: 8, 19
- Node 6: 1, 14, 23, 27
- Node 7: 9, 17, 24
- Node 8: 3, 5, 25
- Node 9: 2, 7, 25
- Node 10: 12, 20, 26
- Node 11: 21, 23
- Node 12: 3, 10, 19, 29
- Node 13: 4, 21, 23
- Node 14: 1, 2, 6, 25
- Node 15: 28
- Node 16: 20
- Node 17: 7, 18, 27
- Node 18: 17, 29
- Node 19: 0, 5, 12
- Node 20: 10, 16, 24, 28
- Node 21: 11, 13, 24
- Node 22: 27
- Node 23: 6, 11, 13
- Node 24: 7, 20, 21
- Node 25: 8, 9, 14, 29
- Node 26: 1, 3, 10, 28
- Node 27: 0, 6, 17, 22
- Node 28: 3, 15, 20, 26
- Node 29: 12, 18, 25

Now, we can see that the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all these, we get a total of 38 3-stars in the graph: [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 19>
<1, 6, 14>
<1, 6, 26>
<1, 14, 25>
<3, 12, 29>
<6, 14, 25>
<12, 19, 29>
<20, 24, 28>
<26, 28, 3>
<27, 17, 18>
<27, 17, 6>
<27, 22, 17>

<25, 9, 14>
<25, 9, 29>
