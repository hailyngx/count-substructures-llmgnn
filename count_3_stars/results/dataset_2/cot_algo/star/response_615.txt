Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more edges incident to them: node 1, node 4, and node 7.

For node 1:
Neighbors: 2, 14, 5, 13, 7
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Unique 3-stars: 
<1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 14>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 14>, <1, 7, 14>, <1, 2, 13>, <1, 5, 13>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 13, 14>

For node 4:
Neighbors: 8, 12, 10, 14
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: 
<4, 8, 12>, <4, 8, 10>, <4, 8, 14>, <4, 10, 12>

For node 7:
Neighbors: 1, 5, 2, 11, 10, 9
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Unique 3-stars: 
<7, 1, 5>, <7, 1, 2>, <7, 1, 11>, <7, 1, 10>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 5, 2>, <7, 5, 11>, <7, 5, 10>, <7, 5, 9>, <7, 2, 11>, <7, 2, 10>, <7, 2, 9>, <7, 11, 10>, <7, 11, 9>, <7, 10, 9>, <7, 1, 10>, <7, 1, 9>, <7, 10, 9>, <7, 1, 5>, <7, 5, 2>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34].
