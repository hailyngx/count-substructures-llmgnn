Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {7, 3, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {7, 3}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8, 12, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 10, 9}
- Node 4: {10, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 8, 11, 0}
- Node 6: {5, 14, 12, 8, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 11, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {7, 3, 2, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 3, 13}
- Node 11: {7, 5, 14, 13}
- Node 12: {6, 2, 9}
- Node 13: {6, 0, 10, 11, 14, 9}
- Node 14: {6, 11, 13}

Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 68 3-stars: [68].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 13>, <0, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 13>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 12>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 8, 13>, <2, 12, 9>, <2, 12, 13>, <2, 9, 13>, <3, 5, 13>, <5, 6, 8>, <5, 6, 13>, <5, 8, 13>, <6, 9, 13>, <7, 0, 9>, <7, 1, 3>, <9, 12, 13>, <11, 13, 14>, <13, 14, 6>.
