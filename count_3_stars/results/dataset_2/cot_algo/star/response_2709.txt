Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 6, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 7, 8, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 0, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9, 8, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 2, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 2, 3, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 0}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 38 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 6, 9)> 
<2, (5, 1, 7)> 
<2, (5, 3, 4)> 
<2, (6, 9, 8)> 
<2, (6, 8, 0)> 
<2, (9, 5, 6)> 
<2, (9, 5, 2)> 
<2, (9, 6, 8)> 
<2, (9, 0, 6)> 
<5, (9, 6, 2)> 
<5, (6, 9, 8)> 
<5, (6, 8, 2)> 
<8, (6, 9, 8)> 
<8, (6, 8, 2)> 
<9, (6, 9, 8)>
