Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 10) (0, 6) (0, 12) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 16) (17, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 8, 19, 3, 1, 11
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 17, 14, 19
Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 8, 1, 15
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 9, 2, 15, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the final number is [18].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (8, 1, 11)>, <9, (5, 17, 19)>, <13, (8, 1, 15)>, <14, (9, 2, 15)>.
