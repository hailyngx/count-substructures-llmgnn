Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = 5 * 10 = 50

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
