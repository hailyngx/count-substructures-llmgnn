Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 17) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (0, 11) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 12) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 19) (12, 6) (12, 19) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 11, 10
- Node 1: 16, 15, 4
- Node 2: 15, 10, 5
- Node 3: 15, 7, 17
- Node 4: 13, 18, 1, 17
- Node 5: 13, 2, 14
- Node 6: 16, 7, 12
- Node 7: 3, 10, 6
- Node 8: 13, 18
- Node 9: 15, 17
- Node 10: 0, 7, 2
- Node 11: 16, 0, 15
- Node 12: 6, 19
- Node 13: 8, 5, 4, 19
- Node 14: 18, 5, 19
- Node 15: 11, 1, 3, 9, 2
- Node 16: 11, 1, 6
- Node 17: 3, 4, 9
- Node 18: 8, 4, 14
- Node 19: 13, 14, 12

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for these nodes:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 1 3-star (<1, 4, 15>)
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star (<4, 1, 17>)
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star (<6, 16, 7>)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 13: 1 3-star (<13, 4, 19>)
- Node 15: 1 3-star (<15, 1, 3>)
- Node 16: 1 3-star (<16, 6, 11>)
- Node 17: 0 3-stars
- Node 18: 1 3-star (<18, 4, 14>)
- Node 19: 1 3-star (<19, 13, 14>)

Total number of 3-stars: 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
