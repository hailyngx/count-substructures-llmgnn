Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 47 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [47]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 5, 6)>
