Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 10) (17, 28) (17, 0) (3, 25) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 18) (4, 11) (8, 29) (8, 0) (28, 17) (28, 0) (28, 12) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 12) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 13) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 24) (20, 29) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 2) (2, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 11) (18, 25) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 7) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 13) (22, 6) (23, 5) (23, 13) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 27) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 24) (16, 19) (16, 27) (24, 15) (24, 16) (24, 5) (5, 23) (5, 24) (9, 25) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 0) (12, 28) (12, 29) (12, 20) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 19) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 16) (11, 4) (11, 2) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 21) (13, 23) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 8, 17, 28
- Node 1: 0, 2, 10
- Node 2: 1, 11, 18, 20
- Node 3: 9, 25, 26
- Node 4: 11
- Node 5: 9, 23, 24
- Node 6: 10, 13, 14, 18, 22
- Node 7: 9, 15, 18, 19
- Node 8: 0, 29
- Node 9: 3, 5, 7, 25
- Node 10: 1, 13, 14, 19, 21
- Node 11: 2, 4
- Node 12: 20, 28, 29
- Node 13: 6, 10, 21, 23
- Node 14: 6, 10, 16
- Node 15: 7, 20, 24
- Node 16: 14, 16, 19, 24, 27
- Node 17: 0, 28
- Node 18: 2, 6, 7, 25
- Node 19: 7, 10, 16
- Node 20: 2, 12, 15, 29
- Node 21: 10, 13, 27
- Node 22: 6
- Node 23: 5, 13
- Node 24: 5, 15, 16
- Node 25: 3, 9, 18, 26
- Node 26: 3, 25, 27
- Node 27: 16, 21, 26
- Node 28: 0, 12, 17
- Node 29: 8, 12, 20

Now, we'll identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, 23, 24, 27

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 4: 0
- For node 5: 1 (3-star formed by nodes 5, 23, 24)
- For node 8: 0
- For node 23: 0
- For node 24: 1 (3-star formed by nodes 24, 5, 15)
- For node 27: 1 (3-star formed by nodes 27, 16, 21)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3].

Unique 3-stars:
- <5, 23, 24>
- <24, 5, 15>
- <27, 16, 21>
