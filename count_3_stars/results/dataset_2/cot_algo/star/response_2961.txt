Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4, 6, 7
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 6

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 choose 3 = 4 ways => Total: 4
- Node 1 has 5 choose 3 = 10 ways => Total: 10
- Node 2 has 3 choose 3 = 1 way => Total: 1
- Node 3 has 4 choose 3 = 4 ways => Total: 4
- Node 4 has 5 choose 3 = 10 ways => Total: 10
- Node 6 has 6 choose 3 = 20 ways => Total: 20
- Node 7 has 4 choose 3 = 4 ways => Total: 4
- Node 8 has 4 choose 3 = 4 ways => Total: 4
- Node 9 has 3 choose 3 = 1 way => Total: 1

Summing up, the total number of 3-stars is 58. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 6, 7)> 
<10, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 6, 3)>
<10, (1, 4, 7)>

<4, (3, 7, 0)>
<1, (2, 8, 0)>
