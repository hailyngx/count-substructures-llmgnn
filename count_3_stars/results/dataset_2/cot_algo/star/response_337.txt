Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and how many 3-stars can be formed:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 39, which we put inside brackets: [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
