Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 9, 2}
- Node 2: {13, 1, 10, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 11}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 1, 4}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {13, 2, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 11, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 14, 10, 1}
- Node 10: {9, 4, 2, 12, 14, 0}
- Node 11: {8, 3, 0}
- Node 12: {13, 10}
- Node 13: {12, 2, 7, 0}
- Node 14: {9, 7, 10}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
4. Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
5. Node 5: Only has 5 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed
6. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
7. Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
8. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
9. Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
10. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
11. Node 14: Only has 3 neighbors, so no 3-star can be formed

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 10, 13)>, <0, (8, 10, 11)>, <0, (10, 12, 13)>, <0, (10, 13, 11)>,
<1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 14)>, <1, (5, 9, 10)>, <1, (6, 9, 14)>, 
<2, (10, 12, 13)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 10)>, <4, (5, 8, 10)>,
<4, (6, 8, 10)>, <6, (5, 9, 14)>, <8, (5, 11, 13)>, <8, (5, 13, 0)>,
<9, (5, 10, 14)>, <10, (9, 12, 14)>, <10, (9, 14, 0)>, <10, (12, 14, 0)>,
<10, (12, 14, 13)>
