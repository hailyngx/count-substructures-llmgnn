Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 18) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 17) (4, 0) (4, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 10) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 2) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (9, 19) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 10, 13, 16, 17
- Node 2: 8, 12, 17, 19
- Node 3: 15
- Node 4: 0, 17
- Node 5: 6, 7, 12, 18
- Node 6: 0, 5, 14, 18
- Node 7: 0, 5, 15
- Node 8: 2, 17
- Node 9: 19
- Node 10: 1, 13, 14, 18
- Node 11: 13
- Node 12: 2, 5
- Node 13: 1, 10, 11
- Node 14: 6, 10, 19
- Node 15: 3, 7, 19
- Node 16: 1, 18
- Node 17: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 18: 5, 6, 10, 16
- Node 19: 2, 9, 14, 15

Now we can identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1: <1, (10, 13, 17)>
- Node 2: <2, (8, 12, 17)>
- Node 5: <5, (6, 7, 18)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 5, 18)>
- Node 10: <10, (1, 14, 18)>
- Node 13: <13, (1, 10, 11)>
- Node 15: <15, (3, 7, 19)>

Since each of these nodes forms one unique 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
