Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

The neighbors of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Nodes 1, 3, 4, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so they have the potential to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 3: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 8: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\)

Thus, the final total number of 3-stars is [40].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, 3, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 4, 8>, <1, 3, 4, 9>, <1, 3, 7, 8>, <1, 3, 7, 9>, <1, 3, 8, 9>, <1, 4, 7, 8>, <1, 4, 7, 9>, <1, 4, 8, 9>, <3, 4, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 7, 9>, <3, 4, 8, 9>, <1, 3, 7, 4>, <1, 3, 8, 4>, <1, 4, 8, 3>, <3, 4, 7, 1>, <3, 4, 8, 1>, <4, 7, 8, 1>
