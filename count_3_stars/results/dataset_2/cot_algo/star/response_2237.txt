Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's analyze the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 4, 7, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 7, 1, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 4, 6, 0, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 0, 6, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 4, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 0, 2, 8, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 4, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 4, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 3 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Each of Node 0, Node 4, Node 7 can form \( \text{C}(4, 3) = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \text{C}(5, 3) = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [3 \times 4 + 10] = [22] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <4, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
