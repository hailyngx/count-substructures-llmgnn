Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7, 4}, forms 1 3-star <6, (1, 7, 4)>
2. Node 9: Neighbors {11, 10}, does not form a 3-star
3. Node 4: Neighbors {6, 7, 8, 14, 2}, forms 5 3-stars <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 14)>, <4, (6, 7, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 14)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>
4. Node 7: Neighbors {6, 4, 11, 13, 8}, forms 1 3-star <7, (6, 11, 13)>
5. Node 8: Neighbors {4, 7, 1}, does not form a 3-star
6. Node 0: Neighbors {14, 10, 12}, does not form a 3-star
7. Node 14: Neighbors {4, 0, 12, 2, 10}, forms 1 3-star <14, (4, 12, 2)>
8. Node 3: Neighbors {13, 2, 5}, forms 1 3-star <3, (13, 2, 5)>
9. Node 11: Neighbors {9, 7, 1, 12, 2}, forms 1 3-star <11, (9, 7, 1)>
10. Node 5: Neighbors {3, 13, 10}, forms 1 3-star <5, (3, 13, 10)>
11. Node 13: Neighbors {7, 3, 5, 1, 10}, forms 1 3-star <13, (7, 3, 1)>
12. Node 1: Neighbors {6, 8, 11, 13, 2}, forms 1 3-star <1, (6, 11, 13)>
13. Node 10: Neighbors {9, 0, 14, 5, 13}, forms 1 3-star <10, (9, 0, 14)>
14. Node 2: Neighbors {4, 14, 3, 11, 1}, forms 1 3-star <2, (4, 3, 11)>
15. Node 12: Neighbors {0, 14, 11}, does not form a 3-star

In total, there are 11 unique 3-stars formed in this graph. So, the final number to be put inside brackets is [11].
