Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {6, 9, 3, 7}
2: {8, 0}
3: {9, 1, 7, 5, 4}
4: {9, 3, 7, 0}
5: {6, 3, 7, 0}
6: {5, 1, 8, 0}
7: {1, 3, 4, 0, 5}
8: {6, 9, 2}
9: {8, 4, 3, 1}

Now, we need to find the 3-stars in this graph. We will check each node that has three or more neighbors.

For node 1:
Neighbors: 6, 9, 3, 7
Number of 3-stars: C(4, 3) = 4

For node 3:
Neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 5, 4
Number of 3-stars: C(5, 3) = 10

For node 4:
Neighbors: 9, 3, 7, 0
Number of 3-stars: C(4, 3) = 4

For node 6:
Neighbors: 5, 1, 8, 0
Number of 3-stars: C(4, 3) = 4

For node 7:
Neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 0, 5
Number of 3-stars: C(5, 3) = 10

For node 9:
Neighbors: 8, 4, 3, 1
Number of 3-stars: C(4, 3) = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 36, which should be written as [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 7)>
<1, (9, 3, 7)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<3, (9, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<3, (5, 7, 6)>
<4, (9, 3, 7)>
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 0)>
<6, (1, 8, 6)>
<6, (8, 6, 0)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 0)>
<7, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 7, 0)>
<7, (4, 7, 5)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>
