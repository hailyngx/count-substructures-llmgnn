Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 11) (7, 9) (16, 5) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 2) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

Let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 12, 13, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 18, 8}
- Node 2: {15, 11}
- Node 3: {15, 17, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 12, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 0, 16}
- Node 6: {5, 17, 11, 8}
- Node 7: {9}
- Node 8: {6, 1, 0}
- Node 9: {7, 14, 13}
- Node 10: {12, 18, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {6, 19, 17, 2}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 0, 18}
- Node 13: {9, 10, 0}
- Node 14: {9, 10}
- Node 15: {3, 19, 2}
- Node 16: {5}
- Node 17: {3, 6, 11}
- Node 18: {12, 1, 10, 19}
- Node 19: {15, 18, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the neighbor sets:
- Node 0, 1, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 18 have 4 or more neighbors, so each can form multiple 3-stars:
  - Node 0 can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars
  - Node 1 can form 3C3 = 1 3-star
  - Node 6 can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars
  - Node 8 can form 3C3 = 1 3-star
  - Node 10 can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars
  - Node 13 can form 3C3 = 1 3-star
  - Node 18 can form 4C3 = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 12, 13>
<0, 5, 12, 8>
<0, 5, 13, 8>
<1, 4, 12, 18>
<6, 5, 17, 11>
<6, 5, 17, 8>
<6, 8, 1, 4>
<6, 8, 1, 18>
<6, 8, 1, 0>
<8, 6, 4, 3>
<10, 12, 4, 1>
<10, 12, 18, 1>
<10, 12, 18, 4>
<10, 13, 9, 14>
<10, 13, 9, 0>
<10, 14, 9, 13>
<13, 9, 14, 10>
<18, 12, 4, 3>
<18, 12, 4, 1>
<18, 19, 15, 2>
