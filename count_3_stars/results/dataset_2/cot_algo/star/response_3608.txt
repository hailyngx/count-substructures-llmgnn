Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 0) (8, 23) (23, 8) (23, 21) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 24) (14, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 22) (17, 20) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 28) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 24) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 2) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 6) (9, 3) (9, 20) (10, 21) (10, 24) (21, 23) (21, 10) (21, 13) (16, 25) (16, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 26) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 27) (24, 10) (24, 6) (19, 13) (28, 3) (28, 4) (28, 18) (28, 2) (28, 15) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 26) (26, 6) (26, 18) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (29, 27) (29, 7) (15, 14) (15, 28) (15, 13) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 12) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 20) (2, 28) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 15) (5, 22) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 22) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {25, 14, 12}
- Node 1: {11, 2, 22}
- Node 2: {1, 17, 7, 20, 28}
- Node 3: {25, 28, 9}
- Node 4: {27, 24, 28}
- Node 5: {22}
- Node 6: {20, 24, 26}
- Node 7: {25, 11, 29, 2}
- Node 8: {23}
- Node 9: {3, 20}
- Node 10: {21, 24}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {0, 11, 22}
- Node 13: {21, 19, 15}
- Node 14: {0, 24, 15}
- Node 15: {14, 28, 13}
- Node 16: {25, 22}
- Node 17: {20, 2, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 28, 26}
- Node 19: {13}
- Node 20: {17, 9, 2, 6}
- Node 21: {23, 10, 13}
- Node 22: {1, 16, 5, 12}
- Node 23: {8, 21}
- Node 24: {14, 4, 27, 10, 6}
- Node 25: {3, 7, 27, 16, 0}
- Node 26: {6, 18}
- Node 27: {4, 25, 29, 24}
- Node 28: {3, 4, 18, 2, 15}
- Node 29: {27, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars, we get 24. Therefore, the final number to be written inside brackets is [24]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 25, 14>, <2, 7, 28>, <2, 17, 20>, <2, 17, 28>, <2, 20, 6>, <2, 20, 7>, <2, 20, 28>, <2, 28, 15>, <4, 24, 27>, <6, 20, 24>, <7, 2, 20>, <11, 1, 12>, <12, 0, 22>, <13, 15, 21>, <14, 0, 24>, <15, 14, 28>, <16, 22, 25>, <17, 2, 18>, <18, 17, 28>, <20, 2, 28>, <21, 10, 24>, <24, 14, 27>, <25, 0, 3>, <27, 4, 29>
