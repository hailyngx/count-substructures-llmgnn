Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 3, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42

So, the final answer is [42].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
