Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 8}

Now we will identify the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (3, 4, 8).
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (5, 6, 8).
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (5, 8, 9).
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (3, 4, 6).
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors (4, 7, 9).

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, and we represent it as [5].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>.
