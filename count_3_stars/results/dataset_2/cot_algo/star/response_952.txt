Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 5, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {4, 9, 10}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 8}
- Node 13: {6, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 4, 9, 13}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 64 \), so the final answer is [64].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 9, 10)>
<2, (0, 3, 14)>
<4, (1, 9, 14)>
<9, (4, 11, 13)>
<14, (2, 9, 13)>
