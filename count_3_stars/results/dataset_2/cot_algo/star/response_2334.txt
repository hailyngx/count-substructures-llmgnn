Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 9) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (19, 2) (19, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 10) (3, 18) (3, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 8) (14, 18) (14, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 1) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 14) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {16, 15, 17, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 10}
- Node 2: {6, 19, 1}
- Node 3: {18, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 13, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 18, 4, 17, 15}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {11, 6}
- Node 8: {11, 17, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 18, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 1, 4}
- Node 11: {16, 7, 13, 8}
- Node 12: {16, 3}
- Node 13: {11, 19, 15, 4}
- Node 14: {18, 8}
- Node 15: {5, 0, 13}
- Node 16: {11, 0, 12}
- Node 17: {5, 0, 8}
- Node 18: {5, 9, 14, 3}
- Node 19: {2, 13}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 18

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the final answer is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (15, 17, 9)>, <5, (6, 4, 17)>, <9, (0, 18, 10)>, <10, (9, 1, 4)>, <11, (7, 13, 8)>, <13, (19, 15, 4)>, <18, (9, 14, 3)>.
