Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 14) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 11, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 11, 2, 14, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 1, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {11, 0, 12, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 8, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 8, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 13, 2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 1, 0, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 13, 4, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {14, 10, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 8, 4, 2}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 3, 0, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 3, 13, 11, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 12, 14, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 1, 13, 7, 2, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1: <1, (2, 6, 14)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 11, 12)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 9, 14)>
- Node 8: <8, (4, 10, 13)>
- Node 9: <9, (7, 10, 14)>
- Node 10: <10, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 12: <12, (3, 11, 14)>
- Node 14: <14, (9, 13, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
