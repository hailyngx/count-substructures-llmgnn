Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 1) (27, 19) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 16) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 18) (12, 16) (8, 0) (8, 14) (23, 26) (23, 2) (23, 25) (23, 1) (2, 23) (2, 14) (2, 11) (4, 0) (4, 18) (4, 24) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 28) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 15) (3, 11) (3, 29) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 3) (1, 27) (1, 17) (1, 23) (1, 7) (13, 9) (13, 26) (13, 28) (26, 10) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 21) (16, 6) (16, 12) (29, 3) (29, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 20) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 25) (28, 18) (28, 13) (20, 14) (20, 21) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 29) (7, 1) (7, 24) (24, 10) (24, 4) (24, 7) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 26) (25, 21) (19, 27) (19, 3) (15, 22) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 27, 21, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 27, 17, 23, 7
- Node 2: 23, 14, 11
- Node 3: 11, 29, 19
- Node 4: 18, 24, 0
- Node 5: 10, 22, 29
- Node 6: 9, 25, 16
- Node 7: 1, 24
- Node 8: 0, 14
- Node 9: 0, 6, 22, 13
- Node 10: 17, 26, 24, 5
- Node 11: 2, 18, 3
- Node 12: 16
- Node 13: 9, 26, 28
- Node 14: 8, 2, 20
- Node 15: 22
- Node 16: 6, 12
- Node 17: 10, 1, 18
- Node 18: 4, 11, 18, 28
- Node 19: 27, 3
- Node 20: 14, 21
- Node 21: 0, 26, 20, 25
- Node 22: 9, 5, 15
- Node 23: 26, 2, 25, 1
- Node 24: 10, 4, 7
- Node 25: 6, 23, 26, 21
- Node 26: 10, 23, 13, 25, 21
- Node 27: 0, 1, 19
- Node 28: 18, 13
- Node 29: 3, 5

Based on the above neighbor sets, we can identify the nodes that can potentially form 3-stars by having at least three neighbors:

- Node 0, 9, 21, and 26 have 5 neighbors
- Node 1, 10, 17, and 18 have 4 neighbors
- Node 4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 22, 23, 24, and 25 have 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

For nodes with 5 neighbors (0, 9, 21, 26), there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to form 3-stars, giving us a total of 40 3-stars.
For nodes with 4 neighbors (1, 10, 17, 18), there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to form 3-stars, giving us a total of 16 3-stars.
For nodes with 3 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 13, 14, 22, 23, 24, 25), there is only 1 way to form a 3-star for each, giving us a total of 9 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 40 + 16 + 9 = 65. 

Hence, the final answer is [65], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (9, 21, 26)>
- <9, (0, 6, 13)>
- <21, (0, 26, 25)>
- <26, (0, 10, 23)>
