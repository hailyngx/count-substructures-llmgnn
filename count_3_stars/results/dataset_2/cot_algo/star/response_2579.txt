Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1: {2, 8, 12}
2: {1, 6, 8, 9}
3: {0, 7, 9}
4: {6, 8, 11}
5: {6, 7, 9, 12}
6: {2, 4, 5, 14}
7: {0, 3, 5, 8, 14}
8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11}
9: {2, 3, 5, 11, 12}
10: {0, 13, 14}
11: {4, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14}
12: {1, 5, 9, 10}
13: {10, 11}
14: {6, 7, 10, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

1: {2, 8, 12} - Forms 1 3-star
2: {1, 6, 8, 9} - Forms 1 3-star
3: {0, 7, 9} - Forms 1 3-star
4: {6, 8, 11} - Forms 1 3-star
5: {6, 7, 9, 12} - Forms 1 3-star
6: {2, 4, 5, 14} - Forms 1 3-star
7: {0, 3, 5, 8, 14} - Forms 1 3-star
8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11} - Forms 1 3-star
9: {2, 3, 5, 11, 12} - Forms 1 3-star
11: {4, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14} - Forms 1 3-star
12: {1, 5, 9, 10} - Forms 1 3-star
14: {6, 7, 10, 11} - Forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 11

So, the final answer is [11]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 8, 12)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 11)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
<11, (4, 8, 11)>
<12, (1, 5, 9)>
<14, (6, 7, 10)>
