Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 11) (9, 7) (9, 27) (9, 12) (26, 27) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 8) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 24) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 19) (0, 2) (0, 24) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 25) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 16) (28, 6) (21, 3) (3, 21) (3, 11) (11, 22) (11, 6) (11, 3) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 4) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 27) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 10) (8, 18) (19, 20) (19, 17) (14, 25) (29, 1) (29, 5) (29, 12) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 24) (24, 15) (24, 0) (24, 16) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 25) (4, 23) (4, 10) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 27) (12, 9) (12, 29) (12, 10) (10, 25) (10, 4) (10, 12) (5, 18) (5, 29) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 23) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 24}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 13, 17, 29}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 25}
- Node 3: {11, 21}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 10, 23, 25}
- Node 5: {18, 29}
- Node 6: {11, 16, 28}
- Node 7: {1, 9, 25}
- Node 8: {18}
- Node 9: {7, 12, 27}
- Node 10: {4, 12, 25}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 22}
- Node 12: {9, 10, 29}
- Node 13: {1, 15, 16, 17, 22}
- Node 14: {25}
- Node 15: {13, 18, 20, 24}
- Node 16: {6, 13, 24}
- Node 17: {1, 19, 27}
- Node 18: {5, 8, 15, 23, 27}
- Node 19: {17, 20}
- Node 20: {15, 19, 27}
- Node 21: {3}
- Node 22: {11, 13, 18}
- Node 23: {4, 18, 27}
- Node 24: {0, 15, 16}
- Node 25: {2, 4, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 26: {27}
- Node 27: {9, 17, 18, 20, 23, 26}
- Node 28: {6}
- Node 29: {1, 5, 12}

Only nodes 1, 4, 7, 9, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, and 27 have three or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars from each of these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 70 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 13>
<1, 4, 17>
<1, 4, 29>
<4, 25, 14>
<1, 7, 25>
<9, 12, 29>
<13, 15, 18>
<13, 15, 20>
<15, 18, 23>
<13, 16, 24>
<15, 16, 24>
<18, 22, 23>
<18, 23, 27>
<18, 27, 20>
<22, 13, 18>
<25, 10, 4>
<25, 12, 10>
<25, 7, 1>
<25, 4, 2>
<27, 17, 19>
