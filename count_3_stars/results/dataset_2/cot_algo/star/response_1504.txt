Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 15) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 5) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (9, 18) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 5) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 6) (2, 10) (2, 6) (19, 13) (19, 4) (19, 14) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 5) (14, 12) (14, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 18) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1: 7, 15, 17, 5
2: 10, 6
3: 8, 11, 5
4: 10, 19, 5
5: 1, 3, 0, 4
6: 18, 2
7: 13, 17, 1, 15
8: 13, 12, 3
9: 18
10: 0, 4, 2
11: 16, 3, 17
12: 8, 14, 15
13: 16, 8, 19, 7
14: 12, 19
15: 7, 12, 1, 0
16: 11, 13, 18
17: 11, 7, 1
18: 16, 9, 6
19: 13, 4, 14

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 13

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: \( 13 \times \binom{3}{3} \) = 13
Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( 3 \times \binom{4}{3} \) + \( 1 \times \binom{4}{3} \) = 6

Total number of 3-stars: 13 + 6 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (10, 5, 0)>
<5, (4, 3, 1)>
<7, (17, 15, 1)>
<8, (13, 12, 3)>
<10, (0, 4, 2)>
<11, (16, 17, 3)>
<12, (8, 15, 14)>
<13, (16, 7, 19)>
<15, (7, 12, 0)>
<16, (13, 18, 11)>
<17, (7, 1, 11)>
<19, (13, 14, 4)>
