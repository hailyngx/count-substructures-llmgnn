Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. 

Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 4, and 8: <1, (2, 4, 8)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 3, and 5: <2, (0, 3, 5)>
Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 6, and 8: <3, (1, 6, 8)>
Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, and 7: <6, (3, 4, 7)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, and 7: <8, (1, 4, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
