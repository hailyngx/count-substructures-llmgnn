Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 13) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 23) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 7) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 18) (20, 3) (20, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (19, 26) (19, 15) (26, 19) (26, 16) (26, 4) (28, 12) (28, 24) (21, 3) (21, 11) (21, 15) (21, 4) (7, 25) (7, 5) (7, 24) (7, 2) (7, 17) (11, 21) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 22) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (2, 7) (2, 22) (22, 3) (22, 0) (22, 11) (22, 2) (1, 27) (1, 18) (16, 26) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 23) (14, 29) (15, 19) (15, 21) (15, 17) (17, 6) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 4) (27, 1) (27, 29) (27, 10) (29, 8) (29, 14) (29, 27) (29, 12) (4, 9) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 17) (13, 9) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 12) (24, 28) (24, 7) (10, 23) (10, 27) (12, 6) (12, 28) (12, 8) (12, 29) (12, 18) 

Response:
The central idea here is to first identify the neighbors of each node. Then, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Identify the neighbors of each node:
   - Node 0: {20, 22, 18}
   - Node 1: {27, 18}
   - Node 2: {7, 22}
   - Node 3: {25, 21, 20, 23, 22}
   - Node 4: {9, 26, 21, 17}
   - Node 5: {6, 7, 14}
   - Node 6: {5, 17, 12}
   - Node 7: {25, 5, 24, 2, 17}
   - Node 8: {29, 12}
   - Node 9: {4, 13}
   - Node 10: {27, 23}
   - Node 11: {21, 23, 14, 22}
   - Node 12: {6, 28, 8, 29, 18}
   - Node 13: {9}
   - Node 14: {5, 11, 23, 29}
   - Node 15: {19, 21, 17}
   - Node 16: {26}
   - Node 17: {6, 7, 15, 4}
   - Node 18: {0, 1, 12}
   - Node 19: {26, 15}
   - Node 20: {3, 0}
   - Node 21: {3, 11, 15, 4}
   - Node 22: {3, 0, 11, 2}
   - Node 23: {3, 11, 14, 10}
   - Node 24: {28, 7}
   - Node 25: {3, 7}
   - Node 26: {19, 16, 4}  
   - Node 27: {1, 29, 10}
   - Node 28: {12, 24}
   - Node 29: {8, 14, 27, 12}

2. Calculate the number of 3-stars:
   - From the neighbor sets, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 29.
   
   - For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
   
   - Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Node 24: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
   - Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   - Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   
   - Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 61\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [61]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (20, 21, 22)>, <4, (9, 21, 26)>, <5, (6, 7, 14)>, <6, (5, 12, 17)>, <7, (2, 5, 17)>, <11, (14, 21, 23)>, <12, (6, 8, 29)>, <14, (5, 11, 29)>, <15, (17, 19, 21)>, <17, (4, 6, 7)>, <21, (11, 15, 23)>, <22, (0, 2, 11)>, <23, (10, 11, 14)>, <27, (1, 10, 29)>
