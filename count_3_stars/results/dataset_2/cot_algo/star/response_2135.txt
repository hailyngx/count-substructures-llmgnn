Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node.

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}
Node 2 neighbors: {1, 3, 5, 7}
Node 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 6, 8}
Node 4 neighbors: {0, 6, 7}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 6}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 5, 8}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {0, 3, 6}
Node 9 neighbors: {7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors.

Node 0 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 2 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 7 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [58], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>.
