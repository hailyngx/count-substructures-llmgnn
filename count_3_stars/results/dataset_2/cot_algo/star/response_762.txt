Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 5, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 9, 2}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors:
- Node 6 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars, which are:
  - <6, (2, 5, 7)>
  - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (2, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (5, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (7, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (7, 9, 8)>
  - <6, (5, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (7, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
