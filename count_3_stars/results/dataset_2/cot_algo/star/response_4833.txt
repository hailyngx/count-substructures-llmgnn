Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (13, 19) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (8, 15) (8, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 17) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) (9, 2) (9, 16) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (16, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 3) (18, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {15, 19, 4, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 11, 2}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 17}
- Node 3: {15, 1, 10, 18}
- Node 4: {14, 17, 0, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 12, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 5}
- Node 7: {15, 19, 17}
- Node 8: {15, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 16}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 4}
- Node 11: {1, 14, 8}
- Node 12: {5, 17, 0, 18}
- Node 13: {19, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 11, 4}
- Node 15: {3, 7, 0, 8}
- Node 16: {9}
- Node 17: {2, 12, 4, 7}
- Node 18: {3, 12}
- Node 19: {13, 7, 0}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 12, and 17 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars:
  - Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (15, 4, 12)>, <0, (15, 12, 19)>, <0, (15, 4, 19)>, <0, (4, 12, 19)>
  - Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 2, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 11)>, <1, (6, 11, 2)>, <1, (3, 11, 2)>
  - Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (15, 18, 10)>, <3, (15, 10, 1)>, <3, (18, 10, 1)>, <3, (15, 18, 1)>
  - Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (14, 17, 10)>, <4, (14, 0, 17)>, <4, (14, 0, 10)>, <4, (17, 0, 10)>
  - Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <12, (5, 17, 0)>, <12, (5, 18, 0)>, <12, (18, 17, 0)>, <12, (5, 17, 18)>
  - Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <17, (2, 4, 7)>, <17, (2, 7, 12)>, <17, (4, 7, 0)>, <17, (2, 4, 12)>
  
In total, there are 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 3-stars. 
So, the final number is [24].
