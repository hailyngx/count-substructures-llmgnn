Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighboring nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5
- Node 1: 4, 8, 10, 11, 14
- Node 2: 7, 9, 11, 12
- Node 3: 4, 9, 11
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8, 14
- Node 5: 0, 9, 13, 14
- Node 6: 1, 7, 10
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 13
- Node 8: 1, 4, 7, 12
- Node 9: 2, 3, 5, 11, 12
- Node 10: 1, 6, 12, 14
- Node 11: 1, 2, 3, 9, 13
- Node 12: 2, 8, 9, 10
- Node 13: 5, 7, 11
- Node 14: 1, 4, 5, 10

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10 3-stars
- Node 12: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 10, 14)>, <1, (4, 11, 14)>, <1, (8, 10, 14)>, <1, (8, 11, 14)>, <1, (10, 11, 14)>, <4, (0, 3, 14)>, <5, (9, 13, 14)>, <7, (6, 8, 13)>, <9, (2, 11, 12)>, <11, (2, 9, 13)>, <14, (1, 4, 10)>
