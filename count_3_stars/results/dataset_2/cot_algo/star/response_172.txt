Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 10}
- Node 8: {5, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 3, 8, 9, 11}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 10)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 10: <10, (4, 7, 8)>, <10, (7, 9, 12)>
  
The total number of 3-stars formed is 4, so the answer is [4].
