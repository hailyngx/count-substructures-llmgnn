Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (0, 27) (0, 26) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 5) (27, 8) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 11) (17, 29) (17, 15) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 6) (21, 17) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 13) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 22) (22, 24) (22, 26) (22, 12) (22, 3) (26, 0) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 12) (13, 21) (13, 26) (13, 20) (3, 22) (3, 16) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 2) (15, 17) (15, 10) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 19) (23, 5) (14, 26) (14, 1) (14, 5) (16, 21) (16, 3) (16, 8) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 28) (8, 20) (28, 8) (28, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (5, 27) (5, 10) (5, 23) (5, 14) (19, 11) (19, 25) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 20) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 28) (9, 20) (9, 12) (20, 13) (20, 8) (20, 6) (20, 9) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 26, 27}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 15, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {16, 22}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 11}
- Node 5: Neighbors {10, 14, 23, 27}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 20, 29}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {16, 20, 25, 27, 28}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 12, 20, 24, 28}
- Node 10: Neighbors {5, 15}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 18, 19}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 22, 26}
- Node 13: Neighbors {20, 21, 26}
- Node 14: Neighbors {1, 5, 26}
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 10, 17}
- Node 16: Neighbors {3, 8, 21}
- Node 17: Neighbors {15, 21, 29}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 11}
- Node 19: Neighbors {11, 25}
- Node 20: Neighbors {6, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 21: Neighbors {13, 16, 17, 24}
- Node 22: Neighbors {3, 12, 26}
- Node 23: Neighbors {5}
- Node 24: Neighbors {21, 22}
- Node 25: Neighbors {8, 19}
- Node 26: Neighbors {0, 12, 13, 14, 22}
- Node 27: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 28: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 29: Neighbors {6, 17}

Next, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 2: 
    - {0, 1, 15}
    - <2, (0, 15, 1)>
- Node 5: 
    - {10, 14, 27}
    - <5, (10, 14, 27)>
- Node 7: 
    - {4, 6, 9}
    - <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 8: 
    - {16, 20, 25}
    - <8, (16, 20, 25)>
- Node 9: 
    - {7, 12, 20}
    - <9, (7, 12, 20)>
- Node 12: 
    - {9, 22, 26}
    - <12, (9, 22, 26)>
- Node 13: 
    - {20, 21, 26}
    - <13, (20, 21, 26)>
- Node 14:
    - {1, 5, 26}
    - <14, (1, 5, 26)>
- Node 15: 
    - {2, 10, 17}
    - <15, (2, 10, 17)>
- Node 16: 
    - {3, 8, 21}
    - <16, (3, 8, 21)>
- Node 21: 
    - {13, 16, 17}
    - <21, (13, 16, 17)>
- Node 22: 
    - {3, 12, 26}
    - <22, (3, 12, 26)>
- Node 26:
    - {0, 12, 13}
    - <26, (0, 12, 13)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified, we have a total of [13].
