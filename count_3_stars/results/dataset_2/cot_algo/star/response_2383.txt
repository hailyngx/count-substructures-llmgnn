Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 12, 4}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 7}
- Node 2: {10, 8, 7, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 14, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 0, 14, 2, 3}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 11, 10}
- Node 6: {5, 8, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 12, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 2, 6}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 1, 13, 7}
- Node 10: {5, 0, 12, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 1}
- Node 12: {10, 13, 7, 14, 0}
- Node 13: {9, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {10, 12, 3, 4}

Now, let's find the nodes that form 3-stars. We observe that nodes 0, 2, 4, 10, 12, and 14 have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars with these nodes as centers.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (only 1 3-star)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [49].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (10, 4, 12)>, <2, (10, 4, 14)>, <4, (10, 2, 14)>, <4, (12, 9, 13)>, <4, (9, 13, 8)>, <4, (0, 10, 12)>, <10, (5, 12, 14)>, <12, (10, 13, 7)>, <12, (7, 9, 13)>, <14, (10, 12, 4)>
