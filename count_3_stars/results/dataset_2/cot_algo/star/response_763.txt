Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 11) (26, 4) (1, 21) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 27) (21, 22) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 0) (13, 9) (13, 22) (22, 21) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 20) (23, 26) (23, 29) (23, 28) (23, 27) (10, 3) (10, 27) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 24) (29, 23) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 16) (19, 11) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 29) (11, 19) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 18) (24, 12) (24, 16) (24, 28) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 15) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 15) (27, 21) (27, 23) (27, 10) (27, 29) (20, 22) (20, 8) (4, 26) (4, 6) (25, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 15) (28, 23) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 15) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {14, 17}
- Node 1: {8, 21}
- Node 2: {6, 12, 15, 18}
- Node 3: {10, 16, 21}
- Node 4: {6, 26}
- Node 5: {8, 15, 25}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 15}
- Node 7: {28, 29}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 15, 20}
- Node 9: {13, 16, 26}
- Node 10: {3, 27}
- Node 11: {19, 22, 26, 29}
- Node 12: {2, 18, 24}
- Node 13: {9, 22}
- Node 14: {0, 16}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 6, 8, 28}
- Node 16: {3, 9, 14, 24}
- Node 17: {0}
- Node 18: {2, 12, 24}
- Node 19: {11}
- Node 20: {8, 22}
- Node 21: {1, 3, 22, 27}
- Node 22: {11, 13, 20, 21}
- Node 23: {26, 27, 28, 29}
- Node 24: {12, 16, 18, 28}
- Node 25: {5}
- Node 26: {4, 9, 11, 23}
- Node 27: {10, 21, 23, 29}
- Node 28: {7, 15, 23, 24}
- Node 29: {7, 11, 23, 27}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<2, (12, 18, 15)>, <3, (16, 9, 24)>, <8, (1, 5, 15)>, <11, (19, 22, 29)>, <15, (2, 5, 6)>, <21, (1, 3, 22)>, <22, (11, 13, 20)>, <24, (12, 16, 18)>, <26, (4, 9, 11)>, <27, (10, 21, 29)>, <28, (7, 15, 24)>.
