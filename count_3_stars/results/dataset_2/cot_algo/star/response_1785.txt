Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 20) (3, 27) (3, 23) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 12) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 11) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 19) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 13) (28, 6) (28, 17) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 29) (21, 5) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 16) (29, 9) (29, 22) (29, 24) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 22) (2, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 16) (20, 26) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 7) (23, 3) (23, 12) (25, 15) (25, 11) (5, 3) (5, 21) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 23) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 18) (7, 24) (7, 27) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 2) (19, 14) (19, 20) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the number of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (14, 24, 8, 2)
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (9, 4, 16)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (10, 0, 22, 13)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (27, 23, 5)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (18, 1, 11)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (3, 21)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (9, 28, 11)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (18, 24, 27)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (9, 15, 0, 16)
- Node 9: 5 neighbors (26, 6, 29, 1, 8)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (17, 18, 2)
- Node 11: 5 neighbors (6, 17, 4, 24, 25)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (15, 24, 23)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (15, 18, 2)
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (0, 19)
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (8, 25, 13, 12)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (8, 1)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (10, 28, 22, 11)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (10, 4, 7, 13)
- Node 19: 2 neighbors (14, 20)
- Node 20: 2 neighbors (26, 19)
- Node 21: 1 neighbor (5)
- Node 22: 3 neighbors (17, 2, 29)
- Node 23: 2 neighbors (3, 12)
- Node 24: 5 neighbors (0, 29, 11, 7, 12)
- Node 25: 2 neighbors (15, 11)
- Node 26: 2 neighbors (9, 20)
- Node 27: 2 neighbors (3, 7)
- Node 28: 2 neighbors (6, 17)
- Node 29: 3 neighbors (9, 22, 24)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star (9, 1, 8)
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star (15, 8, 13)
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star (17, 10, 28)
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star (22, 2, 29)
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star (24, 0, 29)

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph, which can be listed as follows:
<9, 1, 8>, <15, 8, 13>, <17, 10, 28>, <22, 2, 29>, <24, 0, 29>.
