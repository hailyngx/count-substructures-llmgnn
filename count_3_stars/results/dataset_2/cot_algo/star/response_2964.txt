Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to calculate the degree of each node in the graph. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.

Node 0: 5 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 2: 4 edges
Node 3: 5 edges
Node 4: 5 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges

Next, we will find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {9, 6, 4, 7, 2}
Node 1 neighbors: {5, 3, 4, 8}
Node 2 neighbors: {5, 4, 8, 0}
Node 3 neighbors: {5, 9, 1, 4, 8}
Node 4 neighbors: {6, 1, 3, 2, 0}
Node 5 neighbors: {6, 2, 1, 3}
Node 6 neighbors: {5, 9, 4, 0}
Node 7 neighbors: {0, 8}
Node 8 neighbors: {1, 3, 7, 2}
Node 9 neighbors: {6, 3, 0}

Now we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8

Now we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, 6, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 3>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 3>, <1, 8, 3>, <3, 5, 9>, <3, 5, 1>
