Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 6, 8}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 55

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [55].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (4, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
