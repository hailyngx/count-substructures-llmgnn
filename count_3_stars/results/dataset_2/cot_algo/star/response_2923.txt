Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Given the description provided, we first need to identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 6, 8, 2, 4}
Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 7}
Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
Node 5: {4, 6}
Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 5}
Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 7}
Node 9: {7}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
