Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (17, 2) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 18) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {16}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 15, 17}
- Node 3: {10}
- Node 4: {9, 19}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 11}
- Node 6: {7, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 14, 19}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 12, 15}
- Node 11: {5, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 12: {9, 10, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 13: {0, 11, 15, 18}
- Node 14: {7, 12, 16, 19}
- Node 15: {2, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 16: {1, 14}
- Node 17: {2, 11}
- Node 18: {12, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 6, 7, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \(C(3,3) = 1\)
- Node 2: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
- Node 5: \(C(3,3) = 1\)
- Node 7: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
- Node 9: \(C(3,3) = 1\)
- Node 10: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
- Node 11: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
- Node 12: \(C(5,3) = 10\)
- Node 13: \(C(4,3) = 4\)
- Node 14: \(C(4,3) = 4\)

Total number of 3-stars: \(1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 37\)

Therefore, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 9, 10>, <2, 5, 7>, <2, 5, 11>, <2, 7, 14>, <7, 14, 16>, <7, 14, 19>, <7, 16, 19>, <9, 10, 12>, <10, 12, 14>, <12, 14, 16>
