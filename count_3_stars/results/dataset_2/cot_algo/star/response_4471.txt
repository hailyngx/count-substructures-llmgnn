This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a clearer format:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 13, and 14.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, 12, and 14.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 9.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 13.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 12, 14.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 9, 10, 12.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 11.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, 9.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, 14.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 12, 13, 14.
Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 13.
Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 10.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 10, 11.
Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 9, 10.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 5, 6, 13, 14. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 12, 14. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 9. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 11, 13. It does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 10, 11, 12, 14. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 8. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 9, 10, 12. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 8, 11. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 9. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 8, 14. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 12, 13, 14. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 13. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 10. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 10, 11. It forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9, 10. It forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 71

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [71].
