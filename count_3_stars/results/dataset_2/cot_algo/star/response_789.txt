Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {5, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 9, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 3, 7, 10}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 5, 8}

Nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to find the number of 3-stars around these nodes.

Number of 3-stars around each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (2, 5, 14)>
- <1, (4, 13, 14)>
- <4, (1, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 14)>
- <6, (2, 9, 10)>
- <9, (4, 6, 12)>
- <10, (3, 6, 13)>
- <13, (0, 1, 3)>
- <14, (0, 1, 8)>
