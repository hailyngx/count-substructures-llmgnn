Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed in the graph by following the steps mentioned earlier.

Let's first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up these results, we get a total of 52 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 5, 8, 9>
- <3, 4, 5, 9>
- <5, 7, 8, 9>
