Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 18) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 7) (19, 5) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 7) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 18) (16, 6) (16, 18) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 16) 

Response:
Given that there are 20 nodes in the graph and we are looking for 3-stars, we will first determine the neighbors of each node: 

- Node 0: Neighbors {14, 2, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {17, 8, 13, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 12, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {17, 13, 2, 19, 10}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 7, 16, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 11, 19, 18}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 15}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 0, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 14, 7}
- Node 12: Neighbors {17, 13, 4, 15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {5, 12, 3, 15}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 11}
- Node 15: Neighbors {9, 13, 12, 18}
- Node 16: Neighbors {6, 18}
- Node 17: Neighbors {3, 12, 5}
- Node 18: Neighbors {7, 3, 15, 16}
- Node 19: Neighbors {7, 5}

Now, we will determine the 3-stars:

Three-star centered at node 3: <3, (8, 13, 18)>, <3, (8, 15, 18)>

Three-star centered at node 5: <5, (2, 10, 19)>, <5, (5, 10, 19)>

Three-star centered at node 6: <6, (7, 11, 16)>, <6, (7, 11, 19)>, <6, (7, 16, 18)>, <6, (7, 16, 19)>, <6, (11, 14, 7)>, <6, (11, 14, 18)>, <6, (11, 18, 7)>, <6, (11, 18, 16)>

Three-star centered at node 7: <7, (11, 14, 18)>, <7, (11, 18, 16)>, <7, (11, 18, 19)>

Three-star centered at node 12: <12, (13, 15, 18)>

Three-star centered at node 13: <13, (3, 15, 18)>, <13, (5, 12, 17)>

Three-star centered at node 15: <15, (12, 18, 17)>  

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the graph.
