Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 15) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 17) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 6) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 13) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 17) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 12) (1, 0) (1, 16) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 3) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 17) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 9) (9, 17) (5, 10) (5, 7) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
Node 0 has 4 neighbors 
Node 2 has 4 neighbors 
Node 3 has 3 neighbors 
Node 6 has 4 neighbors 
Node 13 has 5 neighbors 
Node 15 has 4 neighbors 
Node 18 has 4 neighbors 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, 14, 4>
<0, 18, 16>
<2, 3, 13>
<2, 13, 19>
<2, 6, 16>
<3, 4, 14>
<6, 12, 15>
<13, 0, 14>
<13, 0, 1>
<13, 2, 3>
<13, 2, 6>
<15, 6, 12>
<15, 11, 8>
<15, 11, 15>
<15, 17, 2>
<15, 17, 7>
<18, 0, 14>
<18, 0, 10>
<18, 0, 1>
<18, 19, 13>
