Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 23) (4, 29) (4, 17) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 29) (18, 3) (18, 22) (18, 27) (12, 24) (27, 18) (27, 23) (10, 26) (10, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 13) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 20) (28, 11) (28, 9) (28, 25) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 13) (5, 23) (5, 25) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 26) (19, 11) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 6) (23, 4) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 19) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 21) (2, 15) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 6) (16, 10) (16, 21) (16, 0) (21, 8) (21, 16) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 14) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 2) (6, 1) (0, 22) (0, 16) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 25) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 9) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 24) (9, 28) (9, 14) (24, 12) (24, 20) (25, 28) (25, 5) (25, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 22, 16
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 6, 20, 14
- Node 2 neighbors: 15, 22, 6, 1
- Node 3 neighbors: 15, 14, 18
- Node 4 neighbors: 23, 29, 17
- Node 5 neighbors: 23, 25
- Node 6 neighbors: 17, 19, 2, 1
- Node 7 neighbors: 17, 13
- Node 8 neighbors: 19, 29, 21
- Node 9 neighbors: 28, 14
- Node 10 neighbors: 26, 16
- Node 11 neighbors: 28, 19, 20
- Node 12 neighbor: 24
- Node 13 neighbors: 15, 7, 26
- Node 14 neighbors: 3, 15, 1, 9
- Node 15 neighbors: 2, 3, 13, 14
- Node 16 neighbors: 10, 21, 0
- Node 17 neighbors: 4, 6, 7
- Node 18 neighbors: 22, 27, 3
- Node 19 neighbors: 11, 23, 8, 6
- Node 20 neighbors: 11, 1, 24
- Node 21 neighbors: 8, 16
- Node 22 neighbors: 18, 2, 0, 29
- Node 23 neighbors: 4, 27, 5, 19
- Node 24 neighbors: 12, 20
- Node 25 neighbors: 28, 29, 5
- Node 26 neighbors: 15, 10, 13
- Node 27 neighbors: 18, 23
- Node 28 neighbors: 11, 9, 25
- Node 29 neighbors: 4, 22, 8, 25

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 26
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25, 27, 28, 29

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed: 

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: There are no 3-stars formed as each node needs at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star.
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars can be formed per node.

Total number of 3-stars = (16 nodes with 4 neighbors) * (4 3-stars per node) = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].
