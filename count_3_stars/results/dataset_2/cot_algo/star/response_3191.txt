Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 15) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 1) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 14) (6, 10) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 15) (14, 8) (14, 3) (16, 10) (16, 17) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 17) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 18}
- Node 2: {1, 8, 15}
- Node 3: {8, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 9, 13, 19}
- Node 5: {1, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {10, 17}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 14, 18}
- Node 9: {4, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 6, 12, 16}
- Node 11: {13, 15}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 11, 15}
- Node 14: {3, 8}
- Node 15: {2, 11, 13}
- Node 16: {10, 17}
- Node 17: {6, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 19}
- Node 19: {4, 9, 17}

Now, let's find the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:

We see that nodes 1, 4, 8, and 13 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 22 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (2, 5, 18)>
<1, (4, 13, 15)>
<1, (4, 7, 19)>
<1, (5, 12, 13)>
<2, (1, 8, 15)>
<3, (8, 10, 12)>
<4, (1, 13, 5)>
<4, (7, 19, 9)>
<4, (13, 15, 11)>
<4, (1, 18, 8)>
<5, (13, 11, 15)>
<8, (2, 14, 3)>
<8, (18, 1, 4)>
<8, (3, 14, 18)>
<13, (1, 15, 11)>
<13, (4, 5, 11)>
<13, (4, 15, 11)>
<13, (5, 11, 15)>
<17, (6, 16, 10)>
<17, (6, 10, 16)>
<17, (16, 10, 6)>
<17, (16, 6, 10)>
