Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 15) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 13) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 18) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 12) (7, 14) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 4) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 12) (6, 16) (12, 9) (12, 14) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 10, 5, 18
- Node 1: 11, 17, 15, 13
- Node 2: 5, 19, 4
- Node 3: 8, 18, 14
- Node 4: 10, 11, 2
- Node 5: 13, 2, 8, 0
- Node 6: 16
- Node 7: 14
- Node 8: 10, 5, 9, 3
- Node 9: 17, 8, 12
- Node 10: 0, 15, 8, 4
- Node 11: 1, 4, 15
- Node 12: 9, 14
- Node 13: 1, 5, 16, 18
- Node 14: 7, 16, 3, 12
- Node 15: 10, 11, 1
- Node 16: 13, 6, 14
- Node 17: 1, 9
- Node 18: 13, 0, 19, 3
- Node 19: 18, 2

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 18 have 3 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 18), there is 1 3-star formed with that node.
- For the remaining nodes (4, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14), we calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors:
  - Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from nodes with exactly 3 neighbors) + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the final answer is [19], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 10, 18>
<1, 11, 15>
<2, 4, 5>
<3, 8, 18>
<4, 10, 11>
<5, 8, 10>
<8, 5, 10>
<9, 12, 14>
<13, 16, 18>
<14, 3, 12>
