Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 12) (2, 29) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 6) (27, 3) (27, 26) (27, 19) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 4) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 16) (25, 8) (18, 5) (18, 7) (28, 16) (28, 9) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 28) (16, 13) (7, 25) (7, 18) (9, 28) (9, 13) (4, 20) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 14) (26, 27) (23, 1) (23, 6) (10, 5) (10, 14) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 21) (21, 4) (21, 13) (21, 22) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 24) (8, 11) (8, 22) (24, 8) (1, 23) (1, 14) (1, 22) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 1) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 8) (22, 20) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 12}
- Node 1: {14, 22, 23}
- Node 2: {11, 29}
- Node 3: {15, 16, 17, 27}
- Node 4: {12, 14, 20, 21}
- Node 5: {10, 14, 18}
- Node 6: {19, 23, 29}
- Node 7: {18, 25}
- Node 8: {11, 17, 22, 24, 25}
- Node 9: {13, 28}
- Node 10: {5, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 8, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {9, 13, 15, 16, 21, 25}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 5, 10, 12, 21, 22}
- Node 15: {3, 12, 13}
- Node 16: {3, 13, 25, 28}
- Node 17: {3, 11, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {5, 7}
- Node 19: {6, 17, 27}
- Node 20: {4, 22, 25}
- Node 21: {4, 13, 14}
- Node 22: {1, 8, 14, 20}
- Node 23: {1, 6}
- Node 24: {8}
- Node 25: {4, 7, 8, 13, 16, 20}
- Node 26: {27}
- Node 27: {3, 19, 26}
- Node 28: {9, 16}
- Node 29: {2, 6}

Now, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we calculate the combination \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding all the combinations together: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 107 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [107].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (15, 16, 17)>
<4, (12, 14, 20)>
<8, (11, 17, 22)>
<13, (15, 16, 25)>
<14, (1, 4, 22)>
<25, (7, 13, 16)>
