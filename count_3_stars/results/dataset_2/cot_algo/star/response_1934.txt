Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 13) (6, 16) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 8) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 12) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 0) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 19) (8, 18) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 16) (19, 2) (19, 3) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 1
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 2

Next, we identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 15, 17}
- Node 2: {13, 18, 19}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 17, 19}
- Node 4: {9, 14, 17, 18}
- Node 5: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {9, 13, 16}
- Node 7: {11, 13}
- Node 8: {18}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 10: {16, 17}
- Node 11: {0, 7, 17}
- Node 12: {5, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 14: {4, 12, 16}
- Node 15: {1, 12}
- Node 16: {6, 10, 14, 18}
- Node 17: {1, 4, 10, 11, 3}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 8, 16}
- Node 19: {2, 3}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 16: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, 14, 18>
- <13, 0, 7>
- <13, 0, 2>
- <13, 2, 5>
- <13, 2, 6>
- <16, 6, 10>
- <16, 6, 14>
- <16, 14, 4>
- <16, 14, 18>
- <17, 1, 11>
- <17, 1, 3>
- <17, 1, 4>
- <17, 1, 10>
- <17, 3, 19>
- <17, 3, 4>
- <17, 4, 9>
- <17, 4, 18>
- <17, 10, 16>
- <17, 11, 7>
- <17, 11, 0>
