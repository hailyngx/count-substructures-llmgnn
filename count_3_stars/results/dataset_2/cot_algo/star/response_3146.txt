Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 11, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 11}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 7: {6, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 4, 6}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:
- From the above list, nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 1, 5, 8, and 12

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- For node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 38, so the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 13)>
- <1, (3, 5, 14)>
- <1, (3, 8, 14)>
- <1, (5, 8, 13)>
- <1, (5, 8, 14)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 12)>
- <1, (5, 8, 12)>
- <5, (8, 10, 12)>
- <5, (4, 8, 12)>
- <5, (4, 8, 14)>
- <5, (4, 8, 6)>
- <5, (8, 10, 12)>
- <5, (8, 10, 12)>
- <5, (9, 10, 12)>
- <5, (9, 10, 12)>
- <5, (4, 9, 12)>
- <5, (4, 10, 12)>
- <5, (4, 9, 10)>
- <5, (9, 10, 12)>
- <5, (9, 10, 12)>
- <8, (1, 2, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 14)>
- <8, (1, 7, 8)>
- <8, (1, 7, 14)>
- <12, (4, 11, 13)>
- <12, (5, 11, 13)>
- <12, (4, 5, 13)>
- <12, (11, 5, 13)>
