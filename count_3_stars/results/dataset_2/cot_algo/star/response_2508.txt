Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {0, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {13}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 8, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 4, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 13}

Nodes 0, 3, 8, and 13 have 5 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with these nodes. Let's calculate:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Adding these results together: 10 + 20 + 20 + 35 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 10, 11)>, <0, (1, 4, 10)>, <0, (1, 10, 8)>, <0, (4, 10, 11)>, <0, (8, 10, 11)>, 
<3, (1, 12, 13)>, <3, (2, 13, 14)>, <3, (7, 11, 12)>, <3, (7, 11, 3)>, <3, (8, 12, 14)>, 
<8, (9, 12, 13)>, <8, (9, 13, 14)>, <8, (10, 13, 14)>, 
<13, (9, 10, 14)>
