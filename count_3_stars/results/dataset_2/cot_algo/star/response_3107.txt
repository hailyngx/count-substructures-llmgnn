Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 9  
Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 8  
Node 2: 4, 6, 7, 8  
Node 3: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9  
Node 4: 2, 5  
Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7  
Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9  
Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 6, 9  
Node 8: 0, 1, 2  
Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 7  

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9. For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed.

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [50].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <7, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 3, 6)>
