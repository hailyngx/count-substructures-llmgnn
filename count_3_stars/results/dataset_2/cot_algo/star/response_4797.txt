Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 8, 6, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 2, 10, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 8, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors {14, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {8, 12, 2}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 1, 11, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 14, 7, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 11, 10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 4, 2, 0}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 2, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {12, 1, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 12, 7, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 4, 13, 10, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {12, 1, 11, 0, 3, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {6, 3, 13}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 3-stars formed = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: 3-stars formed = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: 3-stars formed = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: 3-stars formed = 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: 3-stars formed = 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 3-stars formed = 1 (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 3-stars formed = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: 3-stars formed = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: 3-stars formed = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: 3-stars formed = inom{6}{3} = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 55

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [55].

The unique 3-stars found are:
