Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 8}

Now, we will look for nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60, which we represent as [60].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 1, 8)>
- <4, (0, 9, 8)>
- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
