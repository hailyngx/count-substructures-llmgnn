Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 6) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 0) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors are 4, 5, 7, 9, 13, 16
- Node 1: Neighbors are 12, 14, 18
- Node 2: Neighbors are 9, 11, 12, 14
- Node 3: Neighbors are 6, 16, 17
- Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 8, 13
- Node 5: Neighbors are 0, 11, 14
- Node 6: Neighbors are 3, 11, 15, 19
- Node 7: Neighbors are 0, 19
- Node 8: Neighbors are 4, 13, 14
- Node 9: Neighbors are 0, 2
- Node 11: Neighbors are 2, 5, 6, 12
- Node 12: Neighbors are 1, 2, 11
- Node 13: Neighbors are 4, 8
- Node 14: Neighbors are 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 15: Neighbors are 6, 18, 19
- Node 16: Neighbors are 0, 3, 17
- Node 17: Neighbors are 3, 16
- Node 18: Neighbors are 1, 15, 19
- Node 19: Neighbors are 6, 7, 15, 18

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 0
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 0
- Node 13: 0
- Node 14: 0
- Node 15: 1
- Node 16: 1
- Node 17: 0
- Node 18: 0
- Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 7, so the answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 5, 16)>
- <2, (11, 14, 5)>
- <3, (6, 16, 17)>
- <4, (0, 8, 13)>
- <5, (0, 11, 14)>
- <6, (3, 11, 15)>
- <15, (6, 18, 19)>
