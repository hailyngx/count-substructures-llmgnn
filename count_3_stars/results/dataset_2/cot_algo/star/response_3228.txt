Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 8) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 16) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 11) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 15) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 8) (12, 9) (12, 10) (16, 18) (16, 19) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 7, 15, 19
- Node 2: 0, 8, 13
- Node 3: 0, 11, 13
- Node 4: 0, 9, 10, 11
- Node 5: 6, 7, 11
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9, 11
- Node 7: 1, 5, 14, 15
- Node 8: 2, 9, 15, 17
- Node 9: 4, 6, 8, 12
- Node 10: 4, 12, 13
- Node 11: 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 12: 9, 10
- Node 13: 2, 3, 10
- Node 14: 7, 19
- Node 15: 1, 7, 8
- Node 16: 18, 19
- Node 17: 8
- Node 18: 16
- Node 19: 1, 14, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14 has \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16 has \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 has \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 18 has \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 30 3-stars in this graph, which is represented as [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (7, 14, 15)>, <4, (6, 9, 11)>, <4, (6, 10, 11)>, <6, (5, 11, 7)>, <6, (5, 11, 11)>, <6, (5, 11, 4)>, <6, (5, 11, 3)>, <6, (5, 11, 6)>, <7, (15, 1, 19)>, <8, (17, 9, 15)>, <8, (17, 9, 2)>, <8, (17, 9, 8)>, <8, (17, 9, 6)>, <8, (15, 9, 2)>, <8, (15, 9, 17)>, <8, (15, 9, 8)>, <8, (15, 9, 6)>, <8, (15, 2, 17)>, <8, (15, 2, 8)>, <8, (15, 2, 6)>, <8, (15, 17, 8)>, <8, (15, 17, 6)>, <8, (15, 8, 6)>, <9, (12, 10, 4)>, <9, (12, 10, 13)>, <11, (3, 5, 4)>, <11, (3, 5, 6)>, <11, (3, 5, 11)>
