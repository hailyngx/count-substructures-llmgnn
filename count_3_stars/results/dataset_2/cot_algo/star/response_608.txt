Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 12) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {6, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 14: {2, 6, 11, 12}

Now, let's find the 3-star configurations:
- Node 1 forms 1 unique 3-star: <1, (6, 9, 10)>
- Node 11 forms 1 unique 3-star: <11, (5, 7, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
