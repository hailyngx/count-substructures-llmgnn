Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 6) (2, 16) (2, 8) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (8, 2) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 13) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 13) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 6) (19, 18) (19, 3) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 6) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 14) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 15) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0:  neighbors {5, 15, 13}
- Node 1:  neighbors {4, 17, 14, 13}
- Node 2:  neighbors {16, 8}
- Node 3:  neighbors {4, 19, 10}
- Node 4:  neighbors {7, 10, 1, 3}
- Node 5:  neighbors {9, 15, 0}
- Node 6:  neighbors {7, 13, 12}
- Node 7:  neighbors {16, 4, 6}
- Node 8:  neighbors {2}
- Node 9:  neighbors {5, 18, 17, 14}
- Node 10: neighbors {4, 12, 3}
- Node 11: neighbors {17}
- Node 12: neighbors {16, 10, 6}
- Node 13: neighbors {1, 17, 0, 6}
- Node 14: neighbors {9, 1, 15}
- Node 15: neighbors {5, 0, 14}
- Node 16: neighbors {7, 12, 18, 2}
- Node 17: neighbors {11, 9, 1, 13}
- Node 18: neighbors {16, 9, 19}
- Node 19: neighbors {18, 3}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: 3-stars [1]
- Node 1: 3-stars [1]
- Node 4: 3-stars [1]
- Node 5: 3-stars [1]
- Node 6: 3-stars [1]
- Node 9: 3-stars [1]
- Node 13: 3-stars [1]
- Node 14: 3-stars [1]
- Node 15: 3-stars [1]
- Node 16: 3-stars [1]
- Node 17: 3-stars [1]
- Node 18: 3-stars [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [12]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 5, 15>
<1, 4, 7>
<2, 8, 16>
<3, 4, 10>
<6, 7, 13>
<9, 14, 17>
<13, 0, 6>
<14, 9, 15>
<16, 2, 18>
<18, 9, 19>
<5, 0, 15>
<7, 4, 6>
