Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 24) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 26) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 14) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 20) (18, 13) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 29) (20, 18) (20, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 25) (14, 0) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 28) (6, 23) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 5) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 13) (17, 13) (17, 16) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 23) (12, 21) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 29) (24, 21) (24, 22) (11, 2) (11, 23) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 10) (27, 20) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 9) (22, 2) (22, 24) (8, 15) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 13) (19, 7) (4, 5) (5, 28) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 29) (10, 3) (10, 23) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 16) (29, 15) (29, 12) (29, 5) 

Response:
Using the given edge list, we can construct the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {14, 7, 16, 6, 9}
- Node 1 neighbors: {16, 19, 9}
- Node 2 neighbors: {18, 22, 12, 13, 11}
- Node 3 neighbors: {25, 10, 26, 12}
- Node 4 neighbors: {5}
- Node 5 neighbors: {28, 8, 4, 29}
- Node 6 neighbors: {15, 0, 28, 23}
- Node 7 neighbors: {0, 12, 19, 23}
- Node 8 neighbors: {15, 5}
- Node 9 neighbors: {1, 0, 16}
- Node 10 neighbors: {3, 23}
- Node 11 neighbors: {2, 23}
- Node 12 neighbors: {21, 3, 2, 7, 29}
- Node 13 neighbors: {2, 18, 26, 17, 19}
- Node 14 neighbors: {25, 0}
- Node 15 neighbors: {6, 8, 29}
- Node 16 neighbors: {1, 0, 17, 9}
- Node 17 neighbors: {13, 16}
- Node 18 neighbors: {2, 20, 13}
- Node 19 neighbors: {1, 7, 13}
- Node 20 neighbors: {18, 27}
- Node 21 neighbors: {28, 12, 24}
- Node 22 neighbors: {2, 24}
- Node 23 neighbors: {6, 7, 11, 10}
- Node 24 neighbors: {21, 22}
- Node 25 neighbors: {3, 14}
- Node 26 neighbors: {3, 13}
- Node 27 neighbors: {20}
- Node 28 neighbors: {21, 6, 5}
- Node 29 neighbors: {15, 12, 5}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-star structures:
- Node 1, Node 16, Node 9: <1, 16, 9>
- Node 3, Node 25, Node 14: <3, 25, 14>
- Node 2, Node 18, Node 13: <2, 18, 13>
- Node 12, Node 21, Node 24: <12, 21, 24>
- Node 12, Node 3, Node 2: <12, 3, 2>
- Node 15, Node 29, Node 5: <15, 29, 5>

Thus, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in this graph.
