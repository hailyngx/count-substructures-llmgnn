Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (19, 15) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (18, 3) (18, 5) (13, 14) (16, 6) (16, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 3, 7, 15}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 15, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 17, 12, 5}
- Node 3: {11, 0, 16, 12, 18}
- Node 4: {10, 1}
- Node 5: {15, 2, 18}
- Node 6: {9, 16}
- Node 7: {17, 0, 14}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 11, 0}
- Node 10: {17, 4, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 3, 14, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 11, 2}
- Node 13: {14}
- Node 14: {11, 7, 1, 13}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 19, 5}
- Node 16: {6, 3}
- Node 17: {10, 2, 7}
- Node 18: {3, 5}
- Node 19: {15}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: {9, 3, 7, 15}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 15, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 17, 12, 5}
- Node 3: {11, 0, 16, 12, 18}
- Node 5: {15, 2, 18}
- Node 7: {17, 0, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 11, 0}
- Node 10: {17, 4, 2}
- Node 11: {9, 3, 14, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 11, 2}
- Node 14: {11, 7, 1, 13}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 19, 5}
- Node 17: {10, 2, 7}
- Node 18: {3, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0, 1 3-star
- Node 1, 1 3-star
- Node 2, 1 3-star
- Node 3, 1 3-star
- Node 5, 1 3-star
- Node 7, 1 3-star
- Node 9, 1 3-star
- Node 10, 1 3-star
- Node 11, 1 3-star
- Node 12, 1 3-star
- Node 14, 1 3-star
- Node 15, 1 3-star
- Node 17, 1 3-star
- Node 18, 1 3-star

Total: 14 3-stars

Therefore, the final answer is [14]. And the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 9, 3, 15>, <1, 4, 8, 15>, <2, 9, 10, 17>, <3, 11, 14, 12>, <5, 15, 2, 18>, <7, 17, 0, 14>, <9, 6, 2, 11>, <10, 17, 4, 2>, <11, 9, 3, 14>, <12, 3, 11, 2>, <14, 11, 7, 1>, <15, 0, 1, 19>, <17, 10, 2, 7>, <18, 3, 5>
