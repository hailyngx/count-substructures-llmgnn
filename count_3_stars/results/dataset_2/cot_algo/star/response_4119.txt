Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 three-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 three-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 three-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 three-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 three-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 three-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 three-stars.

Adding up all the three-stars possibilities:
4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of 56 3-stars in the given graph, and the answer to the problem is [56]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
