Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 13, 2, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 10, 2, 14, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 1, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 13, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 2, 12, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8, 13, 3}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {13, 2, 14, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {14, 3}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 11, 0, 12, 1}
- Node 11: {10}
- Node 12: {5, 10, 8, 1}
- Node 13: {7, 8, 3, 0, 6}
- Node 14: {9, 8, 0, 1}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 10, Node 13, Node 14

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars they participate in:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 76 \).

So, the final answer is [76]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (10, 13, 14)>, <1, (4, 10, 12)>, <2, (5, 8, 14)>, <5, (2, 3, 12)>, <6, (7, 8, 13)>, <8, (12, 14, 1)>, <10, (4, 11, 12)>, <13, (0, 6, 8)>, <14, (9, 0, 1)>
