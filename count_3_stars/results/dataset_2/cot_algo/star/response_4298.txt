Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 3) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 5) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (0, 19) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 5) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 19) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 12) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: (19)
- Node 1: (5, 18, 19)
- Node 2: (5, 13, 16)
- Node 3: (4, 8, 10, 16)
- Node 4: (3, 6, 8)
- Node 5: (1, 2, 8, 12, 15)
- Node 6: (4, 7)
- Node 7: (6, 9, 17)
- Node 8: (3, 4, 5, 18)
- Node 9: (7, 11, 14)
- Node 10: (3)
- Node 11: (9, 14)
- Node 12: (5, 13, 15)
- Node 13: (2, 12, 17)
- Node 14: (9, 11, 15, 19)
- Node 15: (5, 12, 14, 18)
- Node 16: (2, 3, 19)
- Node 17: (7, 13, 16)
- Node 18: (1, 8, 15)
- Node 19: (0, 1, 14, 16)

Next, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 8, 15)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (3, 4, 18)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (5, 13, 15)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star: <14, (9, 11, 15)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, (5, 12, 18)>
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star: <16, (2, 3, 19)>
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star: <18, (1, 8, 15)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
