Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 9, 4, 7, 5
Node 1: 5, 7, 3, 2
Node 2: 9, 4, 1, 3, 6
Node 3: 9, 7, 1, 2, 8
Node 4: 0, 8, 6, 2
Node 5: 6, 1, 7, 0
Node 6: 5, 4, 2
Node 7: 5, 0, 3, 1, 8
Node 8: 4, 7, 3
Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars formed:

Node 0: 4 neighbors, can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 1: 4 neighbors, can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 2: 5 neighbors, can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 3: 5 neighbors, can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 4: 4 neighbors, can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 5: 4 neighbors, can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 6: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
Node 7: 5 neighbors, can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 8: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
Node 9: 3 neighbors, can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 49
Therefore, the final answer is [49].

The unique 3-stars found are:
