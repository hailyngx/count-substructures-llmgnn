Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 15) (5, 16) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (19, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 9) (15, 18) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 18) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 0) (7, 1) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 17) 

Response:
First, letâ€™s list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 8, 17}
- Node 1: {13, 14, 7, 19}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 8, 16, 18}
- Node 3: {2, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {8, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {16}
- Node 6: {8}
- Node 7: {1}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6, 17}
- Node 9: {10, 13, 15}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 11: {3, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 9, 13}
- Node 14: {1, 11, 12, 18}
- Node 15: {9, 12, 18}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 17}
- Node 17: {0, 8, 16}
- Node 18: {2, 14, 15}

Now we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars.

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors = 1 3-star

Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 8, 17)>, <2, (3, 8, 18)>, <2, (4, 8, 18)>, <2, (8, 16, 18)>, <2, (8, 16, 17)>, <2, (4, 10, 13)>, <2, (8, 12, 14)>, <2, (8, 12, 15)>, <2, (12, 14, 15)>, <8, (0, 2, 17)>, <8, (4, 10, 13)>, <8, (4, 12, 14)>, <8, (4, 12, 15)>, <8, (12, 14, 15)>, <14, (1, 11, 18)>, <14, (1, 12, 18)>, <14, (12, 15, 18)>, <15, (9, 12, 18)>
