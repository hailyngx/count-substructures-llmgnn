Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 62, thus the final answer is [62].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 8>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 3, 8>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <3, 6, 7>
- <3, 6, 9>
- <5, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 9>
