Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 7) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 14) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 10) (19, 5) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 4) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 16) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 15) (1, 12) (1, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 12, 15
Node 1: 12, 18
Node 2: 0, 6, 12
Node 3: 12, 17
Node 4: 9, 10, 15
Node 5: 7, 19
Node 6: 2, 8, 9, 14, 19
Node 7: 5, 16, 17, 19
Node 8: 6, 7, 13
Node 9: 4, 6, 18
Node 10: 4, 12, 17, 19
Node 11: 14
Node 12: 0, 2, 3, 10, 1
Node 13: 8, 18
Node 14: 6, 11
Node 15: 0, 4, 16
Node 16: 7, 15, 17
Node 17: 3, 7, 10, 16
Node 18: 1, 9, 13
Node 19: 5, 6, 10, 7

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding all the 3-stars, we get 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \([33]\).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
