Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 9, 7, 5, 2
- Node 2: 5, 1
- Node 3: 6, 9, 7, 5
- Node 4: 9, 7, 8
- Node 5: 6, 7, 8, 2, 1, 3
- Node 6: 9, 5, 3, 8, 0
- Node 7: 4, 3, 5, 1, 8
- Node 8: 6, 9, 4, 7, 5
- Node 9: 6, 8, 4, 3, 1

Next, let's find the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 5, 7, 8
- Nodes with 6 neighbors: 3, 9

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 4 neighbors: 1 3-star
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars each

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10*3 + 20*2 = 61

Therefore, the final answer is [61].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 8)>
