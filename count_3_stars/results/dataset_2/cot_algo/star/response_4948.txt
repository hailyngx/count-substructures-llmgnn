Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {2, 3, 6}
Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 9}
Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 8}
Node 4: {2, 5}
Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}
Node 7: {1, 5, 9}
Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 9}
Node 9: {1, 5, 7, 8, 2}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 7, 5)>
