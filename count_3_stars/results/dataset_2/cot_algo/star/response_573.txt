Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {13, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {9, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 4}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 72 3-stars.

Therefore, the answer is [72], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 9>, <0, 1, 14>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 6, 9>, <0, 6, 14>, <0, 6, 5>, <0, 9, 10>, <0, 9, 6>, <0, 9, 8>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 5, 7>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 10>, <1, 6, 3>, <1, 6, 14>, <1, 9, 10>, <3, 5, 10>, <3, 5, 6>, <3, 5, 0>, <3, 6, 14>, <3, 6, 0>, <3, 9, 10>, <4, 13, 2>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 14, 7>, <4, 5, 7>, <4, 5, 10>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 7, 10>, <6, 7, 14>, <9, 10, 12>, <10, 7, 14>, <10, 9, 12>
