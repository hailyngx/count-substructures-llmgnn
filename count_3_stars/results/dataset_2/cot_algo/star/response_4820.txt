Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 4, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 12: {5, 6}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {7, 10, 13}

Next, we will identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars
- Node 5: 6 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: 6 neighbors, so there are 20 3-stars
- Node 13: 6 neighbors, so there are 20 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 68 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [68].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 10)>
- <0, (2, 8, 10)>
- <0, (3, 8, 10)>
- <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (7, 8, 11)>
- <5, (7, 11, 13)>
- <5, (8, 11, 13)>
- <5, (11, 12, 13)>
- <10, (1, 9, 13)>
- <10, (1, 13, 14)>
- <10, (9, 13, 14)>
- <13, (1, 9, 14)>
- <13, (4, 9, 14)>
- <13, (4, 10, 14)>
