Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 19) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 23) (8, 25) (8, 7) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 21) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 21) (6, 5) (6, 24) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 4) (9, 10) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 1) (22, 9) (22, 2) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 20) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 19) (24, 6) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 25) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 27) (0, 3) (0, 13) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 16) (21, 11) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 20) (25, 11) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 19) (12, 5) (12, 17) (16, 18) (16, 20) (27, 28) (27, 13) (27, 7) (17, 23) (17, 12) (17, 4) (4, 28) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {3, 13}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {9, 19}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {7, 9, 14, 19, 22, 26}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7, 14, 15}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {17, 28}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {6, 12, 13, 21}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {5, 24}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 8, 27}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {7, 23, 25}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {1, 10, 18, 22}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {9, 11, 23}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {10, 21, 25}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {5, 17}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {0, 5, 25, 27}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {2, 3, 18}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {3, 19}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {18, 20}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {4, 12, 23}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {9, 14, 16}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {1, 15, 2, 25}
21. Node 20: Neighbors {16, 21, 26}
22. Node 21: Neighbors {5, 11, 20, 23}
23. Node 22: Neighbors {9, 2}
24. Node 23: Neighbors {10, 17, 21, 26, 8}
25. Node 25: Neighbors {11, 13, 19, 8}
26. Node 26: Neighbors {2, 20, 23, 28}
27. Node 27: Neighbors {4, 7, 13, 28}
28. Node 28: Neighbors {4, 26, 27}

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph using the neighbor sets:

Node 2 and Node 23 each have 6 neighbors. So, the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) for each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 20 = 40 \), which we'll represent as [40].

Lastly, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <2, (7, 14, 19)>
- <23, (21, 26, 28)>
