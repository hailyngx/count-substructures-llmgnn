Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
