Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 13) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) 

Response:
In this graph, we will first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: {14, 3}
Node 1: {8, 11, 7, 13}
Node 2: {9, 5, 13}
Node 3: {0, 7, 10, 13}
Node 4: {8}
Node 5: {8, 6, 2, 10, 7}
Node 6: {8, 5, 7, 10, 11}
Node 7: {8, 5, 6, 10, 13, 1, 3}
Node 8: {4, 9, 5, 6, 1}
Node 9: {8, 14, 2, 12}
Node 10: {5, 6, 12, 3, 7}
Node 11: {6, 12, 1, 13}
Node 12: {14, 9, 10, 11}
Node 13: {2, 11, 3, 7, 1}
Node 14: {0, 9, 12}

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 90 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [90].

Unique 3-stars: <1, (7, 13, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 13)>, <5, (6, 7, 10)>, <6, (5, 10, 12)>, <7, (1, 3, 13)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (8, 12, 14)>, <10, (5, 7, 12)>, <11, (1, 12, 13)>, <12, (9, 10, 11)>, <13, (1, 7, 11)>
