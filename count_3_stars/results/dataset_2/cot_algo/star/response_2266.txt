Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7, 8

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the final answer is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (8, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>
