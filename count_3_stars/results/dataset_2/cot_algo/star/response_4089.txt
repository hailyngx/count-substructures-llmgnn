Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's first list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {6, 7, 4}
- Node 1: {6, 2, 7, 9, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 9, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 2, 8, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {5, 0, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 4, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 1, 7, 0}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 0, 3, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {9, 3}
- Node 9: {2, 8, 7, 3, 1}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
   <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 3)>, <1, (2, 9, 3)>, <1, (4, 7, 3)>, <1, (4, 9, 3)>, <1, (7, 9, 3)>, <1, (2, 4, 3)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
   <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 2, 9)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>, <3, (5, 2, 7)>, <3, (8, 9, 7)>, <3, (8, 9, 1)>, <3, (8, 7, 1)>, <3, (9, 7, 1)>, <3, (2, 8, 7)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
