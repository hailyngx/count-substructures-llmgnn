Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed using \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 48

Thus, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 7)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <4, (6, 0, 1)>
- <4, (6, 0, 7)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <5, (4, 0, 7)>
- <5, (7, 2, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (3, 1, 4)>
- <7, (4, 1, 0)>
