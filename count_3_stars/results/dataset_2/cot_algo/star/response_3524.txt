Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 0, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 9, 2}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 9, 0}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 0, 9, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 4, 8, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
