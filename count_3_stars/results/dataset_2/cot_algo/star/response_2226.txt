Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 20) (11, 25) (16, 11) (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 20) (1, 24) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 2) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 22) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 29) (10, 27) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 18) (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 27) (18, 29) (22, 7) (22, 26) (22, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (9, 17) (9, 22) (9, 15) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 14) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 5) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 23) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 23) (23, 21) (23, 29) (23, 0) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (24, 1) (24, 20) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 4) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (14, 18) (14, 28) (14, 5) (14, 15) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 12) (27, 10) (27, 18) (12, 3) (12, 25) (4, 11) (4, 15) 

Response:
To find the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we'll first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {8, 28, 23}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {21, 25, 20, 24}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {11, 21, 18, 19}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {28, 6, 12}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {11, 15}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {8, 17, 19, 14}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {7, 17, 3}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {20, 6, 22}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {5, 0}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {17, 22, 15}
11. Node 10: Neighbor {27}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {16, 4, 2, 20, 25}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {25, 3}
14. Node 13: Neighbor {29}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {18, 28, 5, 15}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {26, 9, 14, 4}
17. Node 16: Neighbor {11}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {6, 9, 5, 18}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {2, 17, 14, 27, 29}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {2, 5}
21. Node 20: Neighbors {11, 1, 7, 24}
22. Node 21: Neighbors {1, 23, 2}
23. Node 22: Neighbors {7, 26, 9}
24. Node 23: Neighbors {21, 29, 0}
25. Node 24: Neighbors {1, 20}
26. Node 25: Neighbors {11, 1, 12}
27. Node 26: Neighbors {22, 28, 15}
28. Node 27: Neighbors {10, 18}
29. Node 28: Neighbors {26, 3, 14, 0}
30. Node 29: Neighbors {13, 18, 23}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
Node 14 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 17 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 18 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 20 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
Node 26 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
Node 28 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [39].
