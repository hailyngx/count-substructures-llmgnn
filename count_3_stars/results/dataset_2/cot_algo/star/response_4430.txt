Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (13, 15) (4, 9) (4, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 6) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 16) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 12) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 9) (6, 18) (6, 11) (10, 19) (10, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) 

Response:
The central nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 3, 14, 15, 16, and 19.

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 8, 15, 16
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 14:
- Neighbors: 17, 11, 12, 19
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 15:
- Neighbors: 3, 18, 13
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 16:
- Neighbors: 3, 5, 12, 19
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 19:
- Neighbors: 14, 5, 11, 16, 10
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (8, 15, 16)>, <14, (17, 11, 12)>, <16, (3, 5, 12)>, <19, (14, 5, 11)>, <19, (14, 5, 16)>, <19, (14, 11, 16)>, <19, (5, 11, 16)>, <19, (5, 11, 10)>, <19, (5, 16, 10)>, <19, (11, 16, 10)>
