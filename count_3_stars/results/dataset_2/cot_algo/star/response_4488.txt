Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 6, 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 9
- Node 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 8 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 9 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [16].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 9, 9)>.
