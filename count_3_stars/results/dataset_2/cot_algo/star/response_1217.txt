Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 18) (4, 9) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 6) (15, 19) (15, 13) (13, 15) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 17) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (5, 17) (5, 12) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) 

Response:
The graph you provided has the following structure:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 17, and 16.
- Node 1 is connected to node 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 9, 6, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 10, and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 18 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 17 and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 11, and 17.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 10 and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 16, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 18, and 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 18, and 6.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 9, and 6.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 15 and 17.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 19, and 10.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 19 and 13.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 13, 6, 0, 19, and 5.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 11.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 15, 17, and 14.

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 6.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and 17.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 12, and 6.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 16, and 12.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 18, and 7.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 18, and 6.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, and 6.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 19, and 5.

Counting these unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. The unique 3-stars are <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <6, (2, 11, 17)>, <8, (2, 12, 6)>, <9, (2, 16, 12)>, <10, (3, 18, 7)>, <11, (3, 18, 6)>, and <17, (6, 19, 5)>.
