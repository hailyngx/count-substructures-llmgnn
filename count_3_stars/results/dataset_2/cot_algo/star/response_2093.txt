Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 17) (4, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 19) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 2, 8
Node 1 neighbors: 7, 19, 16
Node 2 neighbors: 7, 8, 12, 0
Node 3 neighbors: 15, 16, 13
Node 4 neighbor: 0
Node 5 neighbors: 7, 19
Node 6 neighbors: 15, 17, 14
Node 7 neighbors: 2, 5, 1
Node 8 neighbors: 9, 2, 14, 0
Node 9 neighbors: 8, 18, 11, 12
Node 10 neighbors: 15, 19
Node 11 neighbors: 9, 13
Node 12 neighbors: 9, 2, 18
Node 13 neighbors: 3, 11, 14
Node 14 neighbors: 6, 8, 13
Node 15 neighbors: 3, 10, 18, 6, 17
Node 16 neighbors: 3, 17, 1
Node 17 neighbors: 15, 6, 16
Node 18 neighbors: 9, 12, 15
Node 19 neighbors: 5, 1, 10

Now, we will check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <2, (7, 8, 0)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <7, (2, 5, 1)>
Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <8, (9, 2, 14)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <9, (8, 11, 12)>
Node 15 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <15, (3, 18, 6)>
Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors: <16, (3, 17, 1)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars formed, we have 6 3-stars in total, so the answer is [6].
