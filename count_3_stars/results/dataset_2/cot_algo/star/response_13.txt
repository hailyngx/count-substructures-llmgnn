Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 22) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 5) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 16) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 22) (6, 18) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (9, 23) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 22) (8, 18) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 0) (5, 10) (17, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 21) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 10) (26, 20) (28, 19) (28, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 27) (2, 20) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 21) (19, 28) (19, 20) (14, 22) (14, 27) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 14) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 19) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 24) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 13) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 14) (25, 11) (25, 5) (10, 5) (10, 1) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 18) (23, 6) (23, 9) (23, 21) (21, 29) (21, 24) (21, 23) 

Response:
The graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges. We will first determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {5, 12, 24}
Node 1: {10, 17, 29}
Node 2: {9, 20, 27}
Node 3: {15, 17, 24}
Node 4: {8, 12}
Node 5: {0, 6, 10, 15, 25}
Node 6: {5, 9, 18, 22, 23}
Node 7: {8, 16}
Node 8: {4, 7, 18, 22}
Node 9: {2, 6, 23, 27}
Node 10: {1, 5}
Node 11: {13, 16, 24, 25}
Node 12: {0, 4}
Node 13: {11, 18, 28}
Node 14: {22, 27}
Node 15: {3, 5}
Node 16: {7, 11, 22}
Node 17: {1, 3, 27, 29}
Node 18: {6, 8, 13}
Node 19: {20, 28}
Node 20: {2, 19, 26}
Node 21: {23, 24, 29}
Node 22: {6, 8, 14, 16}
Node 23: {6, 9, 21}
Node 24: {0, 3, 11, 21}
Node 25: {5, 11}
Node 26: {20}
Node 27: {2, 9, 14, 17}
Node 28: {13, 19}
Node 29: {1, 17, 21}

Now, let's check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors:

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 22, 24, 27, 29

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

Node 0: [1]
Node 5: [6]
Node 6: [10]
Node 8: [4]
Node 9: [4]
Node 11: [1]
Node 13: [1]
Node 22: [2]
Node 24: [2]
Node 27: [2]
Node 29: [1]

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 12, 24)>, <5, (0, 6, 10)>, <5, (6, 15, 25)>, <5, (6, 9, 23)>, <5, (15, 25, 11)>, <5, (0, 12, 6)>, <6, (5, 9, 23)>, <6, (5, 18, 22)>, <6, (22, 16, 7)>, <6, (22, 14, 27)>, <8, (4, 7, 16)>, <8, (4, 18, 13)>, <8, (7, 16, 22)>, <8...
