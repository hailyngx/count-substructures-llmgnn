Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 27) (9, 13) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 3) (18, 27) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 11) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 15) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 15) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 12) (27, 13) (8, 23) (8, 25) (0, 29) (0, 13) (5, 6) (5, 21) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 7) (29, 0) (29, 17) (29, 4) (29, 11) (4, 12) (4, 29) (4, 21) (2, 15) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 3) (13, 9) (13, 27) (13, 0) (13, 25) (16, 24) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 19) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 11) (28, 25) (1, 17) (1, 28) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 7) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 28) (14, 26) (14, 5) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 15) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 24) (3, 28) (19, 16) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 28) (25, 10) (10, 14) (10, 25) (21, 22) (21, 5) (21, 4) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {13, 29}
Node 1: {17, 28}
Node 2: {15}
Node 3: {6, 24, 26, 28}
Node 4: {12, 21, 29}
Node 5: {6, 14, 21}
Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
Node 7: {6, 15, 16, 17}
Node 8: {23, 25}
Node 9: {13, 22, 27}
Node 10: {14, 25}
Node 11: {17, 22, 28, 29}
Node 12: {4, 13, 15, 27}
Node 13: {0, 9, 25, 27}
Node 14: {5, 10, 26}
Node 15: {2, 7, 12, 23}
Node 16: {7, 19, 24, 28}
Node 17: {1, 7, 11, 29}
Node 18: {27}
Node 19: {16}
Node 21: {4, 5, 22}
Node 22: {9, 21, 23}
Node 23: {8, 15, 22}
Node 24: {3, 16, 26}
Node 25: {8, 10, 13, 28}
Node 26: {3, 14, 24}
Node 27: {9, 12, 13, 18}
Node 28: {1, 3, 11, 16, 25}
Node 29: {4, 11, 17}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each:

Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 52
So, the final answer is [52].
