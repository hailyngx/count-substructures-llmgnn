Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (5, 4) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 2, 6, 7, 10, 14
- Node 2: 1, 7, 12, 14
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9, 13, 14
- Node 4: 0, 5, 10, 11, 13
- Node 5: 4, 13
- Node 6: 0, 1, 12, 13
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 13
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9, 12, 14
- Node 9: 3, 8, 10
- Node 10: 1, 4, 9, 13
- Node 11: 4, 14
- Node 12: 2, 6, 8
- Node 13: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10
- Node 14: 1, 2, 3, 8, 11

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 10, 14)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (7, 8, 9, 13, 14)
- Node 4: 5 neighbors (0, 5, 10, 11, 13)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 12, 13)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 13)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (0, 3, 9, 12, 14)
- Node 13: 6 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)
- Node 14: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 8, 11)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 70

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [70].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (8, 13, 14)>
<4, (0, 10, 13)>
<8, (0, 3, 12)>
<13, (4, 5, 7)>
<14, (1, 2, 3)>
