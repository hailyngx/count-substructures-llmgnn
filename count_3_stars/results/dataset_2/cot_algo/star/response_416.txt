Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 5) (4, 7) (4, 22) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 19) (2, 29) (2, 6) (29, 7) (29, 2) (29, 9) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 15) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 24) (27, 5) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 5) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 8) (26, 0) (26, 17) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 19) (17, 26) (17, 20) (17, 13) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 6) (15, 12) (15, 14) (9, 1) (9, 29) (9, 0) (13, 28) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 24) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 14) (23, 26) (23, 24) (18, 8) (19, 7) (19, 11) (0, 26) (0, 9) (0, 25) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 13) (24, 23) (6, 2) (6, 20) (10, 1) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 27) (5, 28) (16, 3) (16, 14) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 16) (8, 26) (8, 3) (8, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 9, 25, 26
- Node 1: 5, 9, 10
- Node 2: 6, 29
- Node 3: 8, 11, 13, 16
- Node 4: 7, 22
- Node 5: 1, 21, 27, 28
- Node 6: 2, 20
- Node 7: 4, 11, 19, 24, 29
- Node 8: 3, 18, 26
- Node 9: 0, 1, 29
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 3, 7, 19
- Node 12: 14, 15, 21, 27
- Node 13: 3, 17, 24, 28
- Node 14: 12, 15, 25, 16
- Node 15: 12, 14
- Node 16: 3, 14
- Node 17: 13, 20, 26
- Node 18: 8
- Node 19: 7, 11
- Node 20: 6, 17, 21
- Node 21: 1, 5, 12, 20
- Node 22: 4, 26, 28
- Node 23: 24, 26
- Node 24: 7, 13, 23, 27
- Node 25: 14, 27
- Node 26: 0, 8, 17, 22, 23
- Node 27: 5, 12, 24, 25
- Node 28: 5, 13, 22
- Node 29: 2, 7, 9

Nodes 0, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 24, and 26 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
