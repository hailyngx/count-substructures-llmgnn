Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 26) (3, 25) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 15) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (19, 13) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 4) (26, 17) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 15) (28, 4) (28, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (11, 18) (11, 8) (23, 24) (20, 7) (20, 14) (4, 26) (4, 16) (4, 28) (12, 24) (12, 22) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 22) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 21) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (15, 25) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 22) (21, 17) (21, 24) (13, 9) (13, 19) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 21) (24, 18) (24, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 27) (27, 6) (27, 14) (27, 10) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 27) (22, 6) (22, 12) (22, 7) (22, 15) (18, 28) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 24) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 18}
- Node 1: {9, 10, 25}
- Node 2: {14, 29}
- Node 3: {6, 25}
- Node 4: {16, 26, 28}
- Node 5: {14, 16}
- Node 6: {3, 9, 17, 22, 27}
- Node 7: {8, 17, 20, 22, 25}
- Node 8: {0, 7, 11, 26}
- Node 9: {1, 6, 13, 15, 25}
- Node 10: {1, 24, 27}
- Node 11: {8, 18}
- Node 12: {22, 24}
- Node 13: {9, 19}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 20, 27}
- Node 15: {1, 9, 16, 22, 25}
- Node 16: {4, 5, 15, 26}
- Node 17: {6, 7, 21, 26}
- Node 18: {0, 11, 24, 28}
- Node 19: {13}
- Node 20: {7, 14}
- Node 21: {17, 24}
- Node 22: {6, 7, 12, 15}
- Node 23: {24}
- Node 24: {10, 12, 18, 21, 23}
- Node 25: {1, 3, 7, 9, 15}
- Node 26: {4, 8, 16, 17, 29}
- Node 27: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 28: {4, 18}
- Node 29: {2, 26}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors: Nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26.

For each of these nodes, we apply the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to find the number of unique 3-stars centered at that node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 96.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [96].

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (9, 15, 25)>, <4, (16, 26, 28)>, <6, (9, 17, 22)>, <7, (17, 20, 22)>, <8, (7, 17, 26)>, <9, (1, 15, 25)>, <14, (5, 20, 27)>, <15, (9, 16, 22)>, <16, (4, 15, 26)>, <17, (6, 7, 26)>, <18, (11, 24, 28)>, <24, (10, 18, 27)>, <25, (1, 15, 9)>, <26, (4, 16, 17)>.
