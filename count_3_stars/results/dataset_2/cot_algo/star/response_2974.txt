Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 16) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (3, 14) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 19) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 18) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (7, 11) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 7) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 5) (12, 19) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 14
Node 1: 0, 10, 14
Node 2: 4, 6, 8, 11
Node 3: 14, 15, 18, 19
Node 4: 2, 18
Node 5: 12, 16
Node 6: 2, 3, 18, 19
Node 7: 11
Node 8: 2, 11, 13
Node 9: 10, 11, 18
Node 10: 1, 9, 15
Node 11: 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 12: 5, 19
Node 13: 8, 17, 6
Node 14: 0, 1, 3, 17
Node 15: 3, 10
Node 16: 5, 17, 19
Node 17: 13, 14, 16
Node 18: 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 19: 3, 6, 12, 16

Now, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 26.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 8, 11)>
<3, (14, 15, 19)>
<6, (3, 18, 19)>
<11, (2, 8, 9)>
<14, (0, 1, 17)>
<18, (3, 4, 6)>
<19, (3, 12, 16)>
