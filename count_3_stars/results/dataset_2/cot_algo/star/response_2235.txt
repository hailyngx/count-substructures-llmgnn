Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node.

Node 0: {1, 4, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 9}
Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6}
Node 5: {2, 7, 8}
Node 6: {4, 8}
Node 7: {5, 8, 9}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 3, 7}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 5: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 9: 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 45

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 4, 8>
<1, 2, 4>
<1, 2, 8>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 5, 8>
<7, 8, 9>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 8, 9>
