Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 13) (10, 1) (10, 2) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (15, 8) (15, 11) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 19) (3, 13) (3, 12) (7, 6) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 2) (5, 14) (5, 16) (5, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: {16, 11, 14, 5}
Node 1 neighbors: {10, 13, 6}
Node 2 neighbors: {16, 19, 6, 10}
Node 3 neighbors: {12, 13}
Node 4 neighbors: {9, 6, 5, 12}
Node 5 neighbors: {16, 14, 4}
Node 6 neighbors: {2, 1, 4, 7}
Node 7 neighbors: {6}
Node 8 neighbors: {9, 15}
Node 9 neighbors: {13, 16, 4, 11, 8}
Node 10 neighbors: {1, 2}
Node 11 neighbors: {0, 9, 15, 19}
Node 12 neighbors: {4, 18, 3, 19}
Node 13 neighbors: {1, 3, 9, 17}
Node 15 neighbors: {11, 8}
Node 16 neighbors: {0, 9, 5, 18, 2}
Node 17 neighbors: {13}
Node 18 neighbors: {12, 16}
Node 19 neighbors: {11, 2, 12}

Now, we will determine the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors (16, 11, 5): <0, (16, 11, 5)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors (16, 19, 6): <2, (16, 19, 6)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors (9, 6, 5): <4, (9, 6, 5)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors (16, 4, 11): <9, (16, 4, 11)>
Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors (9, 15, 19): <11, (9, 15, 19)>
Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors (18, 3, 19): <12, (18, 3, 19)>
Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors (9, 3, 17): <13, (9, 3, 17)>
Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors (9, 5, 18): <16, (9, 5, 18)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we have a total of 8 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the final answer is [8].
