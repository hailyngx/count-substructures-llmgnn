Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {5, 9, 4, 3, 8, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {4, 7, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 9, 3}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 2, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {9, 7, 0, 1, 6}
- Node 5: neighbors {9, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 6: neighbors {4, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors {9, 4, 6, 1}
- Node 8: neighbors {5, 3, 0}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 4, 2, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
Node 0: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 5, 7)>
