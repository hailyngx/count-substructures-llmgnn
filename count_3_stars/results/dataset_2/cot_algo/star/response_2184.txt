Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 4) (3, 18) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (15, 12) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. First, we will list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 19}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 14, 19}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 4: {11, 14, 16, 18}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {9}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 18}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 11}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 11}
- Node 11: {4, 9, 10, 13, 17}
- Node 12: {3, 15, 17}
- Node 13: {11, 17}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 15: {12}
- Node 16: {4}
- Node 17: {3, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 18: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 19: {1, 2}

1. Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 
- Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 11, Node 12, and Node 17 have three or more neighbors.

2. For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

3. Summing up all the 3-stars formed, we get: 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (7, 12, 17)>
- <4, (9, 11, 14)>
- <5, (0, 10, 14)>
- <7, (3, 9, 18)>
- <8, (3, 5, 14)>
- <11, (4, 10, 17)>
- <12, (3, 15, 17)>
- <17, (3, 11, 13)>
