Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {7, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {13}
- Node 6: {0, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 4, 11}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 9, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 7, 11}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 6, 7, 9}

Now, we will identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 9, 10, and 12. 
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 9, 11, and 14. 
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 10, 13, and 14. 
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 9, 14, and 6. 
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 2, and 6. 
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 10, and 12. 
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 9, and 11. 
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 4, and 6. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 8, represented as [8], with the unique 3-stars being:

<1, (9, 10, 12)>, <2, (9, 11, 14)>, <4, (10, 13, 14)>, <6, (9, 14, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <11, (1, 10, 12)>, <13, (4, 9, 11)>, <14, (2, 4, 6)>.
