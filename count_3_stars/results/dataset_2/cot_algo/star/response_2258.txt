Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated as follows:

1. For node 0: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
2. For node 1: Neighbors = {0, 4, 6, 9}. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
3. For node 2: Neighbors = {0, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
4. For node 3: Neighbors = {0, 6}. Number of 3-stars = 0.
5. For node 4: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 8}. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
6. For node 5: Neighbors = {2, 4, 8, 9}. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
7. For node 6: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 9}. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
8. For node 7: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 8}. Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
9. For node 8: Neighbors = {4, 5, 7}. Number of 3-stars = 1.
10. For node 9: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 6}. Number of 3-stars = 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 55 \).

In <0, 1, 4>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 5>, and <2, 4, 7>, we have a total of 7 unique 3-stars formed within the graph.

Thus, the final answer is [55].
