Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, we will find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 14}
- Node 1: {9, 2, 12, 7, 11}
- Node 2: {8, 1, 10}
- Node 3: {6, 13, 7}
- Node 4: {6, 0, 10, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 13, 10}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 12, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 8, 14, 13, 3, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 2, 11, 12, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 10, 1, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {9, 4, 2, 5}
- Node 11: {8, 12, 1}
- Node 12: {6, 8, 11, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 14, 5, 7, 3}
- Node 14: {0, 7, 13}

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: inom{5}{3}= 10
- Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (9, 2, 12)>
- <1, (9, 2, 7)>
- <1, (9, 2, 11)>
- <1, (9, 12, 11)>
- <1, (2, 7, 11)>
- <1, (12, 7, 11)>
- <7, (9, 8, 13)>
- <7, (9, 13, 3)>
- <7, (8, 13, 3)>
- <7, (14, 13, 3)>
- <9, (6, 10, 4)>
- <9, (6, 10, 5)>
- <9, (6, 4, 5)>
- <9, (10, 4, 5)>
- <13, (14, 5, 7)>
