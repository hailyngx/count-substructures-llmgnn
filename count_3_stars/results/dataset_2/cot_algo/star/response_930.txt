Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 12) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 3) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 5) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {3, 13}
Node 1: {9, 12}
Node 2: {6, 11, 17}
Node 3: {0, 4, 19}
Node 4: {3}
Node 5: {7, 11, 15, 16}
Node 6: {2, 8, 11, 14}
Node 7: {5, 10, 14, 15, 17}
Node 8: {6, 13}
Node 9: {1, 16}
Node 10: {7, 12, 17}
Node 11: {2, 5, 6, 13, 18}
Node 12: {1, 10}
Node 13: {8, 11, 0}
Node 14: {6, 7, 16}
Node 15: {5, 7, 18}
Node 16: {5, 9, 14}
Node 17: {2, 7, 10, 19}
Node 18: {11, 15, 19}
Node 19: {3, 17, 18}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Node 2, Node 5, Node 7, Node 11, Node 17, Node 18, and Node 19

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (6, 11, 17)>
<5, (7, 11, 15)>
<5, (7, 11, 16)>
<5, (7, 15, 16)>
<5, (11, 15, 18)>
<7, (5, 11, 15)>
<7, (5, 11, 16)>
<7, (5, 15, 16)>
<7, (11, 15, 18)>
<11, (5, 6, 13)>
<11, (5, 6, 18)>
<11, (6, 13, 18)>
<11, (13, 16, 18)>
<17, (7, 10, 12)>
<17, (7, 10, 19)>
<17, (7, 12, 19)>
<17, (10, 12, 19)>
<18, (11, 15, 19)>
<19, (17, 18, 3)>
