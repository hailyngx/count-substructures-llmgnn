Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 6, 8, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 14)>
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 14)>, <2, (0, 6, 14)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 14)>, <2, (4, 6, 14)>, <2, (4, 7, 12)>, <2, (4, 7, 14)>, <2, (4, 12, 14)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <4, (2, 7, 12)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 12)>, <4, (7, 8, 12)>
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 14)>, <5, (6, 8, 14)>, <5, (6, 9, 11)>, <5, (6, 11, 14)>, <5, (8, 9, 11)>, <5, (8, 11, 14)>, <5, (9, 11, 13)>, <5, (9, 13, 8)>, <5, (11, 13, 10)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 14)>, <6, (2, 10, 14)>, <6, (5, 7, 14)>, <6, (5, 10, 14)>, <6, (7, 10, 14)>, <6, (10, 11, 13)>, <6, (10, 13, 14)>, <6, (11, 13, 10)>, <6, (13, 14, 10)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <7, (2, 4, 12)>, <7, (2, 6, 14)>, <7, (4, 8, 12)>, <7, (6, 10, 14)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 12)>, <8, (4, 12, 14)>, <8, (5, 9, 13)>, <8, (5, 11, 14)>, <8, (5, 13, 9)>, <8, (9, 11, 13)>, <8, (9, 13, 10)>, <8, (11, 13, 10)>, <8, (13, 10, 14)>
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <10, (6, 11, 13)>, <10, (6, 14, 10)>, <10, (11, 13, 8)>, <10, (13, 14, 10)>
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <11, (6, 10, 13)>, <11, (8, 9, 11)>, <11, (8, 13, 10)>, <11, (9, 13, 10)>
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <12, (4, 7, 8)>, <12, (4, 8, 14)>, <12, (7, 8, 14)>, <12, (8, 14, 10)>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <13, (8, 9, 11)>
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <14, (2, 6, 10)>, <14, (2, 6, 14)>, <14, (2, 10, 14)>, <14, (6, 10, 13)>, <14, (6, 10, 14)>, <14, (6, 13, 14)>, <14, (8, 10, 14)>, <14, (10, 13, 14)>, <14, (10, 13, 6)>, <14, (13, 6, 14)>

Adding the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [63].
