Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {10, 13, 14, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 14, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 6, 8}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 5, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 11}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 64

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [64].
