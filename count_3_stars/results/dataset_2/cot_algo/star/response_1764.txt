Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {10, 1, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 9, 6, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 2, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 6, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {8, 12}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 2, 1}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {4, 13, 5, 14}
- Node 9: {7, 10, 11, 0, 1}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 12, 13, 9}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {10, 1, 5, 13}
- Node 13: {7, 10, 11, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {8, 13, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors
- Node 10: 5 neighbors
- Node 12: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 6 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

For nodes with three or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 72

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].
