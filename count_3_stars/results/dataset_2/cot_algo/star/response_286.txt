Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's calculate the degree of each node to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 6

Now, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 5, 3, 1}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 9, 5}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 3}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 2, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 1, 3}
- Node 5: {7, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 1, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 5}
- Node 8: {6, 9, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 8 and Node 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so we calculate \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- All other nodes have less than 3 neighbors and, therefore, do not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \). 

Thus, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are <8, (6, 9, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 1)>.
