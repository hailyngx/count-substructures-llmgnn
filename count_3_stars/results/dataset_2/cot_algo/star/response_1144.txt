Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 19) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 2) (1, 0) (1, 26) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 4) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 5) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 25) (12, 6) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 8) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 10) (15, 20) (20, 3) (20, 22) (20, 15) (17, 25) (17, 4) (17, 7) (29, 12) (29, 8) (29, 21) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 28) (28, 21) (2, 27) (2, 23) (2, 14) (8, 12) (8, 29) (8, 10) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 11) (26, 16) (11, 23) (11, 26) (16, 0) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 7) (25, 22) (25, 17) (25, 5) (5, 18) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 14) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 24) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 17) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 8) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) 

Response:
There are 19 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 26.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars we found, we have a total of 52 3-stars in this graph, so the final number to put inside brackets is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 4, 16>, <0, 4, 27>, <0, 16, 26>, <0, 16, 19>, <2, 14, 23>, <3, 4, 17>, <3, 4, 20>, <3, 14, 24>, <4, 17, 25>, <5, 14, 25>, <6, 12, 27>, <6, 12, 29>, <8, 10, 29>, <12, 27, 2>, <16, 19, 7>, <19, 18, 7>, <20, 15, 3>, <20, 15, 22>, <20, 22, 24>, <25, 5, 14>, <26, 1, 5>
