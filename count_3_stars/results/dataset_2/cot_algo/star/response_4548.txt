Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more readable format to better understand the connections:

Nodes: 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Edges:
(0, 1), (0, 13), (0, 6)
(1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 9)
(2, 1), (2, 13), (2, 6), (2, 4)
(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 10)
(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 9)
(5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 14)
(6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 10), (6, 12), (6, 13)
(7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 11)
(8, 7), (8, 3), (8, 11), (8, 12), (8, 14)
(9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 11)
(10, 3), (10, 6), (10, 12), (10, 14)
(11, 7), (11, 8), (11, 9), (11, 14)
(12, 6), (12, 8), (12, 10), (12, 14)
(13, 0), (13, 2), (13, 6)
(14, 5), (14, 8), (14, 10), (14, 11), (14, 12)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node, list their neighbors:
0: 1, 13, 6
1: 0, 2, 5, 9
2: 1, 13, 6, 4
3: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10
4: 2, 3, 5, 9
5: 1, 3, 4, 14
6: 0, 2, 10, 12, 13
7: 3, 8, 11
8: 7, 3, 11, 12, 14
9: 1, 4, 11
10: 3, 6, 12, 14
11: 7, 8, 9, 14
12: 6, 8, 10, 14
13: 0, 2, 6
14: 5, 8, 10, 11, 12

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
Only nodes 1 and 14 have exactly 3 neighbors, so each of them forms one 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<14, (5, 8, 10)>
