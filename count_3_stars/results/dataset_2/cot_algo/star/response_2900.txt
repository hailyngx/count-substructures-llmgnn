Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (8, 15) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (17, 1) (17, 19) (9, 0) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 18) (16, 2) (16, 6) (2, 16) (2, 19) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 3) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 18) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 4) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can go through each node to determine the neighbor nodes connected to it.

1. Node 0: Neighbors - 1, 9, 11, 18
2. Node 1: Neighbors - 0, 4, 5, 14, 17, 19
3. Node 2: Neighbors - 6, 16, 19
4. Node 3: Neighbors - 4, 13, 18
5. Node 4: Neighbors - 1, 3, 5, 14, 19
6. Node 5: Neighbors - 1, 4, 13
7. Node 6: Neighbors - 2, 10, 13, 16
8. Node 7: Neighbors - 12, 15, 18
9. Node 8: Neighbors - 15
10. Node 9: Neighbors - 0
11. Node 10: Neighbors - 6, 11, 18
12. Node 11: Neighbors - 0, 10, 15
13. Node 12: Neighbors - 7
14. Node 13: Neighbors - 3, 5, 6
15. Node 14: Neighbors - 1, 4, 15
16. Node 15: Neighbors - 7, 8, 11, 14
17. Node 16: Neighbors - 2, 6
18. Node 17: Neighbors - 1, 19
19. Node 19: Neighbors - 1, 2, 4, 17

Now, we need to check for each node if it forms a 3-star. The nodes that can potentially form a 3-star are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 15, 19. Let's count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
2. Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
3. Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
4. Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
5. Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
6. Node 10: inom{3}{3} = 1
7. Node 11: inom{3}{3} = 1
8. Node 13: inom{3}{3} = 1
9. Node 15: inom{4}{3} = 4
10. Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up gives a total of 44 3-stars, so the final answer is [44]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, 1, 4>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 19>, <1, 5, 13>, <4, 5, 13>, <4, 14, 15>, <6, 10, 16>.
