Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 7, 3
Node 1: 5, 9, 2
Node 2: 5, 4, 8, 6, 1
Node 3: 5, 9, 4, 6, 0, 7
Node 4: 8, 3, 6, 2
Node 5: 9, 2, 1, 3, 7
Node 6: 8, 4, 3, 2
Node 7: 0, 5, 8, 3
Node 8: 4, 2, 6, 7
Node 9: 5, 9, 1, 3

Next, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 and Node 3 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = (10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4) = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 9, 2)>, <1, (5, 9, 1)>, <1, (5, 2, 1)>, <1, (9, 2, 1)>, <1, (5, 2, 3)>, <1, (9, 2, 3)>, <1, (9, 1, 3)>, <1, (2, 1, 3)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (9, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 2)>, <3, (9, 4, 2)>, <3, (9, 2, 4)>, <3, (4, 2, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (9, 6, 7)>, <3, (9, 5, 7)>, <3, (6, 5, 7)>, <7, (8, 6, 4)>, <7, (8, 4, 3)>, <7, (8, 6, 3)>, <7, (4, 6, 3)>
