Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {5, 10, 13, 3, 2}
Node 1: {11, 13, 7}
Node 2: {13, 0, 7, 12}
Node 3: {6, 0, 12}
Node 4: {9, 8, 6}
Node 5: {9, 8, 0, 7}
Node 6: {10, 4, 14, 3, 12}
Node 7: {5, 9, 2, 1}
Node 8: {5, 10, 11, 4}
Node 9: {5, 4, 14, 7, 12}
Node 10: {11, 0, 6, 8, 13}
Node 11: {10, 1, 8}
Node 12: {9, 6, 2, 14, 3}
Node 13: {10, 1, 0, 2}
Node 14: {9, 6, 12}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 or more neighbors: 0, 6, 9, 10, 12

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 50 3-stars. So, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (5, 10, 2)>
