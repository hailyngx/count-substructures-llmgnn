Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 7) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 9) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 6) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 17) (18, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (15, 19) (15, 2) (2, 15) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 2) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 6}
- Node 1: {11, 18, 8}
- Node 2: {15, 5}
- Node 3: {10, 5, 18}
- Node 4: {19, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 18, 12, 2}
- Node 6: {13, 7, 4, 0}
- Node 7: {16, 6, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 19, 14}
- Node 9: {10, 13, 17}
- Node 10: {3, 0, 9}
- Node 11: {1}
- Node 12: {13, 19, 5, 14}
- Node 13: {12, 9, 6}
- Node 14: {8, 7, 12}
- Node 15: {19, 2}
- Node 16: {7}
- Node 17: {9, 19, 18}
- Node 18: {1, 3, 17, 5}
- Node 19: {8, 17, 4, 15, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. 
- Node 3: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique sets of leaves in these 3-stars are: <5, (3, 4, 18)>, <5, (3, 12, 2)>, <5, (4, 18, 12)>, <5, (3, 18, 12)>, <5, (4, 12, 2)>, <5, (18, 12, 2)>, <5, (3, 4, 2)>, <5, (18, 4, 2)>, <5, (18, 4, 12)>, <5, (4, 2, 12)>.
- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique sets of leaves in these 3-stars are: <6, (13, 4, 7)>, <6, (13, 0, 7)>, <6, (4, 0, 7)>, <6, (13, 0, 4)>.
- Node 8: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique sets of leaves are: <12, (13, 19, 14)>, <12, (13, 5, 14)>, <12, (19, 5, 14)>, <12, (13, 5, 19)>.
- Node 13: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. The unique sets of leaves are: <18, (1, 17, 5)>, <18, (17, 4, 5)>, <18, (1, 4, 5)>, <18, (1, 3, 5)>.
- Node 19: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. The unique sets of leaves in these 3-stars are: <19, (8, 17, 4)>, <19, (8, 15, 12)>, <19, (8, 15, 2)>, <19, (8, 4, 2)>, <19, (8, 12, 15)>, <19, (17, 15, 12)>, <19, (17, 4, 12)>, <19, (17, 15, 2)>, <19, (4, 12, 15)>, <19, (4, 2, 15)>.

Adding up all the 3-stars formed, we get a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 34 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (11, 18, 8)>, <3, (10, 5, 18)>, <4, (19, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 18)>, <5, (3, 12, 2)>, <5, (4, 18, 12)>, <5, (3, 18, 12)>, <5, (4, 12, 2)>, <5, (18, 12, 2)>, <5, (3, 4, 2)>, <5, (18, 4, 2)>, <5, (18, 4, 12)>, <5, (4, 2, 12)>, <6, (13, 4, 7)>, <6, (13, 0, 7)>, <6, (4, 0, 7)>, <6, (13, 0, 4)>, <8, (1, 19, 14)>, <12, (13, 19, 14)>, <12, (13, 5, 14)>, <12, (19, 5, 14)>, <12, (13, 5, 19)>, <13, (12, 9, 17)>, <14, (8, 7, 12)>, <17, (9, 19, 18)>, <18, (1, 17, 5)>, <18, (17, 4, 5)>, <18, (1, 4, 5)>, <18, (1, 3, 5)>, <19, (8, 17, 4)>, <19, (8, 15, 12)>, <19, (8, 15, 2)>, <19, (8, 4, 2)>, <19, (8, 12, 15)>, <19, (17, 15, 12)>, <19, (17, 4, 12)>, <19, (17, 15, 2)>, <19, (4, 12, 15)>, <19, (4, 2, 15)>.
