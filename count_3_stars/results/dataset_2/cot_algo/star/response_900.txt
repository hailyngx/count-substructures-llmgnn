Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {9, 11, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 11, 8}
- Node 4: {12, 2, 13, 6, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 1, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {5, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 13, 6, 2, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {11, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 10, 13, 6, 8, 0}
- Node 12: {4, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 4, 1, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 1, 6, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 68

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<9, (5, 13, 6)>, <4, (12, 13, 6)>, <6, (1, 11, 14)>.
