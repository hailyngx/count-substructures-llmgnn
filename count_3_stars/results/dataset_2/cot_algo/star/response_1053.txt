Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 2) (1, 11) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 0) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (3, 17, 19, 12)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (11, 17)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (15, 7, 6, 8, 13)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (15, 6, 0)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (7, 13)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (12, 14)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (3, 9, 2, 12)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (4, 2)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (2, 14)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (6, 13)
- Node 10: 1 neighbor (12)
- Node 11: 2 neighbors (16, 1)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (6, 5, 0, 10)
- Node 13: 4 neighbors (4, 9, 18, 2)
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (8, 5)
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (3, 17, 19, 2)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (11, 17)
- Node 17: 6 neighbors (16, 15, 18, 1, 0, 19)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (11, 19, 17, 13)
- Node 19: 4 neighbors (15, 18, 0, 17)

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 6, Node 12, Node 13, Node 15, Node 17, Node 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 17: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 50

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

Now, we will list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, 12, 19>, <0, 12, 17>, <0, 15, 17>, <0, 15, 19>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 6, 15>, <2, 13, 18>, <2, 13, 6>, <2, 13, 15>, <2, 15, 17>, <2, 15, 19>, <6, 12, 0>, <6, 12, 2>, <6, 12, 17>, <6, 12, 19>, <13, 15, 17>, <13, 15, 2>, <13, 15, 6>, <13, 15, 19>, <15, 17, 0>, <15, 17, 19>.
