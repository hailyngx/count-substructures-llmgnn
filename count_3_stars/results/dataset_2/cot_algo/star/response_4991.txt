Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 5}
- Node 2: {4, 3, 9, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 3, 6, 9, 5, 0}
- Node 9: {8, 2, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0 and Node 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 = 21

Therefore, the final answer is [21].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 5, 8)>
- <8, (7, 3, 6)>
- <8, (3, 2, 9)>
- <8, (6, 5, 0)>
- <8, (5, 1, 4)>
- <8, (5, 3, 6)>
