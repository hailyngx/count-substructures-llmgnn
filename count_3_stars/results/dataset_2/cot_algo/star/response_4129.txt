Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors -> forms a 3-star
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors -> forms 3-stars
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors -> forms 3-stars

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 4: 1 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 6) + 10 (from Node 9) = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <4, 0, 5, 9> 
- <6, 0, 3, 7>
- <6, 0, 5, 9>
- <6, 3, 5, 9>
- <6, 5, 4, 9>
- <6, 5, 8, 9>
- <9, 2, 0, 8>
- <9, 2, 5, 8>
- <9, 4, 5, 6>
- <9, 4, 6, 5>
