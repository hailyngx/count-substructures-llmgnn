Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 2: has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars: <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 6)>, <2, (0, 7, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 4)>, <2, (0, 6, 5)>, <2, (0, 6, 4)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 4)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 4)>, <2, (3, 7, 6)>, <2, (4, 7, 6)>
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars: <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars: <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 6, 5)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Counting all the distinct 3-stars found, we have 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46].
The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <2, (0, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 6)>
- <2, (0, 7, 5)>
- <2, (0, 7, 4)>
- <2, (0, 6, 5)>
- <2, (0, 6, 4)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 4)>
- <2, (0, 5, 7)>
- <2, (0, 5, 6)>
