Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 22) (14, 24) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 15) (8, 22) (8, 27) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 10) (12, 17) (12, 27) (12, 11) (12, 15) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 24) (27, 23) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 0) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 28) (0, 23) (0, 21) (21, 0) (21, 28) (21, 26) (21, 18) (21, 25) (28, 20) (28, 21) (28, 25) (11, 12) (4, 27) (4, 15) (4, 29) (7, 20) (25, 21) (25, 28) (25, 26) (25, 19) (29, 20) (29, 4) (29, 9) (29, 16) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 2) (5, 22) (26, 21) (26, 25) (6, 15) (6, 24) (6, 1) (6, 19) (24, 14) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 16) (2, 9) (1, 6) (1, 18) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 16) (3, 17) (3, 23) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 24) (16, 18) (22, 14) (22, 8) (22, 5) (19, 25) (19, 6) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are neighbors for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {21, 23}
Node 1: Neighbors {6, 18}
Node 2: Neighbors {9}
Node 3: Neighbors {17, 23}
Node 4: Neighbors {15, 27, 29}
Node 5: Neighbors {22}
Node 6: Neighbors {1, 15, 19, 24}
Node 7: Neighbors {20}
Node 8: Neighbors {22, 27}
Node 9: Neighbors {2, 9, 18, 29}
Node 10: Neighbors {13}
Node 11: Neighbors {12}
Node 12: Neighbors {11, 15, 17, 27}
Node 13: Neighbors {10, 14, 16, 17}
Node 14: Neighbors {13, 22, 24}
Node 15: Neighbors {4, 12, 15, 20}
Node 16: Neighbors {13, 16, 18, 24, 29}
Node 17: Neighbors {3, 12, 13, 15}
Node 18: Neighbors {1, 9, 16, 21}
Node 19: Neighbors {6, 25}
Node 20: Neighbors {7, 15, 20, 28, 29}
Node 21: Neighbors {0, 18, 25, 26, 28}
Node 22: Neighbors {5, 8, 14}
Node 23: Neighbors {0, 3, 27}
Node 24: Neighbors {6, 14, 16, 24, 27}
Node 25: Neighbors {19, 21, 26, 28}
Node 26: Neighbors {21, 25}
Node 27: Neighbors {4, 8, 12, 23, 24}
Node 28: Neighbors {20, 21, 25}
Node 29: Neighbors {4, 9, 16, 20}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars present in the graph:

There are no 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [0].
