Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 17) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 16) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 14) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 18) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 20 nodes and 60 edges. Let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 9, 15, 11, 18
- Node 1: 5, 7, 13, 16
- Node 2: 7, 15, 17
- Node 3: 6, 10, 11, 17
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 3, 8, 16
- Node 7: 4, 19, 2, 1, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7, 10
- Node 9: 17, 0
- Node 10: 8, 3, 18
- Node 11: 3, 19, 0
- Node 12: 14
- Node 13: 1, 19
- Node 14: 12, 15, 19
- Node 15: 2, 0, 14
- Node 16: 6, 1, 18
- Node 17: 9, 3, 2, 18
- Node 18: 10, 17, 0, 16
- Node 19: 7, 13, 11, 14

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, as these are the potential centers of 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 12

Next, we need to count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these potential center nodes:

1. Node 4:
   - Since node 4 has only 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
   
2. Node 5:
   - Since node 5 has only 1 neighbor, it cannot form a 3-star.
   
3. Node 12:
   - Since node 12 has 3 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found in the graph is <12, 14, 15, 19>.
