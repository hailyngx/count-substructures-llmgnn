Based on the provided information, let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 0 has neighbors {1, 14, 8, 12}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 0.
2. Node 1 has neighbors {0, 6, 10, 12}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 1.
3. Node 2 has neighbors {5, 7, 8, 10}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 2.
4. Node 3 has neighbors {4, 8, 10, 12}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 3.
5. Node 4 has neighbors {5, 11, 13, 14, 3}. As it has 5 neighbors, we can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars with node 4.
6. Node 5 has neighbors {2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 9}. As it has 6 neighbors, we can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars with node 5.
7. Node 6 has neighbors {1, 7, 9, 13}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 6.
8. Node 7 has neighbors {2, 5, 6, 8, 11}. As it has 5 neighbors, we can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars with node 7.
9. Node 8 has neighbors {0, 3, 5, 7, 11}. As it has 5 neighbors, we can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars with node 8.
10. Node 9 has neighbors {5, 6, 14}. As it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 9.
11. Node 10 has neighbors {1, 2, 3}. As it has 3 neighbors, there is 1 3-star with node 10.
12. Node 11 has neighbors {4, 5, 7, 8}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 11.
13. Node 12 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 14}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 12.
14. Node 13 has neighbors {4, 6}. As it has 2 neighbors, there are no 3-stars with node 13.
15. Node 14 has neighbors {0, 4, 9, 12}. As it has 4 neighbors, we can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 14.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars formed from each node:

\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 76 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [76] \).

- <0, 1, 14>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 12, 14>
- <1, 10, 2>
