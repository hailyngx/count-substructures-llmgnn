Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 17) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 16) (11, 15) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 2) (12, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 15) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 16) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 15) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can determine the neighbor sets for each node:

1. Node 0: {8, 18, 7}
2. Node 1: {5, 18, 16}
3. Node 2: {13, 4, 12, 19}
4. Node 3: {9, 13, 16}
5. Node 4: {2, 19, 14, 15}
6. Node 5: {1, 9, 16, 14}
7. Node 6: {7}
8. Node 7: {0, 16, 6}
9. Node 8: {0, 13}
10. Node 9: {5, 3}
11. Node 10: {17}
12. Node 11: {15}
13. Node 12: {2, 15}
14. Node 13: {8, 17, 2, 3, 19}
15. Node 14: {5, 4, 15}
16. Node 15: {18, 11, 12, 19, 14}
17. Node 16: {5, 3, 7, 1}
18. Node 17: {13, 10, 19}
19. Node 18: {8, 1, 0, 15}
20. Node 19: {2, 4, 13, 17, 15}

Now, we'll check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
2. Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
3. Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
4. Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
5. Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
6. Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
7. Node 15: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
8. Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
9. Node 19: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 18, 7)>
<1, (5, 18, 16)>
<2, (13, 4, 12)>
<4, (2, 19, 14)>
<5, (1, 9, 16)>
<13, (8, 17, 3)>
<15, (18, 11, 12)>
<16, (5, 3, 7)>
<19, (13, 17, 15)>
