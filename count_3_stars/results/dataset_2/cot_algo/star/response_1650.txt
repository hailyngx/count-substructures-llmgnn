Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 5, 6, 7
- Node 2: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 7

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding them up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [53].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 8>
- <2, 7, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <5, 6, 8>
- <8, 6, 7>
- <8, 6, 5>
- <8, 7, 9>
