Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 24) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 0) (25, 18) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 27) (17, 15) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 19) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 21) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 23) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (1, 29) (1, 26) (1, 13) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 21) (26, 6) (9, 10) (9, 22) (9, 3) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 6) (5, 25) (5, 8) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 3) (19, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 24) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 21) (12, 14) (12, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 27) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 21) (15, 17) (15, 26) (24, 20) (24, 3) (24, 7) (18, 25) (18, 27) (27, 17) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 18) (27, 13) (4, 23) (4, 6) (23, 0) (23, 4) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 2) (6, 4) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 27) (21, 29) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {25, 14, 23}
- Node 1: {29, 26, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 11}
- Node 3: {9, 19, 24}
- Node 4: {23, 6}
- Node 5: {25, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 26, 22, 4}
- Node 7: {29, 24, 27}
- Node 8: {5, 14, 21}
- Node 9: {10, 22, 3}
- Node 10: {9, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 14, 21}
- Node 12: {14, 16}
- Node 13: {1, 19, 27}
- Node 14: {20, 0, 11, 12, 8}
- Node 15: {17, 26}
- Node 16: {10, 12}
- Node 17: {15, 27}
- Node 18: {25, 27}
- Node 19: {29, 28, 3, 13}
- Node 20: {14, 25, 24}
- Node 21: {29, 26, 11, 8}
- Node 22: {28, 9, 6}
- Node 23: {0, 4}
- Node 24: {20, 3, 7}
- Node 25: {20, 5, 0, 18}
- Node 26: {1, 15, 21, 6}
- Node 27: {17, 28, 7, 18, 13}
- Node 28: {27, 22, 19}
- Node 29: {1, 7, 19, 21}

Next, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 8, Node 14, Node 19, Node 21, Node 26, Node 27, and Node 29.

Now, calculate the number of 3-stars formed by using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of unique 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 14, 20>
- <0, 14, 23>
- <0, 20, 25>
- <0, 8, 14>
- <8, 14, 21>

- <19, 27, 28>
- <19, 27, 2>
- <19, 27, 13>
- <19, 27, 7>
- <21, 26, 1>
- <21, 26, 6>
- <21, 26, 8>
- <21, 26, 29>
- <26, 1, 13>
- <26, 15, 17>
