Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 25) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 21) (8, 25) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 0) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 27) (23, 11) (23, 29) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 24) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 4) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 2) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 2) (12, 17) (12, 28) (12, 19) (27, 22) (27, 16) (21, 26) (21, 15) (28, 12) (28, 24) (2, 20) (2, 15) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 4) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 3) (29, 23) (29, 20) (29, 18) (6, 8) (6, 24) (14, 26) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 1) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 3) (16, 5) (4, 22) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (24, 10) (24, 28) (24, 6) (5, 26) (5, 16) (5, 4) (25, 9) (25, 8) (7, 10) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 7) (18, 1) (18, 29) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {13, 10, 20, 16, 4}
- Node 1: {17, 11, 14, 18}
- Node 2: {20, 15}
- Node 3: {11, 16, 4}
- Node 4: {22, 17, 0, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {26, 16, 4}
- Node 6: {8, 24}
- Node 7: {10, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {25, 6}
- Node 9: {22, 25}
- Node 10: {0, 7, 19, 24}
- Node 11: {1, 23, 3}
- Node 12: {17, 28, 19}
- Node 13: {14, 0}
- Node 14: {26, 13, 22, 1}
- Node 15: {20, 2, 7}
- Node 16: {0, 27, 3, 5}
- Node 17: {1, 4, 12}
- Node 18: {1, 29}
- Node 19: {10, 7, 12}
- Node 20: {0, 15, 29, 2}
- Node 21: {26, 15}
- Node 22: {9, 4, 14, 27}
- Node 23: {11, 29}
- Node 24: {10, 28, 6}
- Node 25: {9, 8}
- Node 26: {14, 5, 21, 22}
- Node 27: {26, 16}
- Node 28: {12, 24}
- Node 29: {23, 20, 18}

Now, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 16, and Node 20 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 1, Node 10, and Node 14 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 15 and Node 19 have 3 neighbors each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0, there are 1 3-star.
- For Node 4, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 16, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 20, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 31.

So, the final answer, in brackets [], is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (13, 10, 4)>
- <4, (22, 17, 0)>
- <16, (0, 27, 3)>
- <20, (0, 15, 29)>
- <26, (14, 5, 22)>
- <1, (17, 14, 18)>
- <10, (0, 7, 19)>
- <14, (26, 13, 22)>
- <15, (20, 2, 7)>
- <19, (10, 7, 12)>
