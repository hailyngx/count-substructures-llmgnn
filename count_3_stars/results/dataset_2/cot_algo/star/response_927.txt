Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2
- Node 6: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 47

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [47].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 5, 2)>
- <0, (3, 2, 8)>
- <0, (4, 2, 8)>
- <0, (5, 2, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 2)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <0, (4, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (8, 7, 9)>
