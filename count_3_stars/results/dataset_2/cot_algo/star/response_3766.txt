Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

1. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
2. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
3. Node 7 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
4. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
5. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
6. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
7. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
8. Node 16 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
9. Node 17 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
10. Node 18 has 3 neighbors: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
11. Node 21 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
12. Node 24 has 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
13. Node 27 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
14. Node 29 has 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 45
