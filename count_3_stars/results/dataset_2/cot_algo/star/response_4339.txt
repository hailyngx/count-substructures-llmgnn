Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 27) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 27) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 20) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 4) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 19) (29, 17) (29, 19) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 20) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 21) (15, 1) (15, 28) (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 4) (22, 2) (22, 25) (7, 24) (7, 23) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 27) (21, 26) (21, 16) (21, 18) (14, 28) (14, 5) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 5) (27, 3) (27, 8) (27, 16) (27, 25) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 23) (5, 26) (5, 14) (5, 25) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 19) (23, 7) (23, 18) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 24) (20, 26) (19, 17) (19, 29) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 0) (28, 1) (28, 15) (28, 14) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 13, and 24. 

For node 1: 
Neighbor set: {3, 15, 16, 28}
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 15, 16)>, <1, (3, 15, 28)>, <1, (3, 16, 28)>, <1, (15, 16, 28)>

For node 2:
Neighbor set: {4, 13, 19, 22}
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 13, 19)>, <2, (4, 13, 22)>, <2, (4, 19, 22)>, <2, (13, 19, 22)>

For node 8:
Neighbor set: {13, 20, 24, 27}
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <8, (13, 20, 24)>, <8, (13, 20, 27)>, <8, (13, 24, 27)>, <8, (20, 24, 27)>

For node 13:
Neighbor set: {2, 6, 8, 20}
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <13, (2, 6, 8)>, <13, (2, 6, 20)>, <13, (2, 8, 20)>, <13, (6, 8, 20)>

For node 24:
Neighbor set: {7, 8, 20, 26}
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Unique 3-stars: <24, (7, 8, 20)>, <24, (7, 8, 26)>, <24, (7, 20, 26)>, <24, (8, 20, 26)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20\)

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
