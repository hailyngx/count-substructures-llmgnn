Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 2, 8, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 2, 8, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 2, 0, 7, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 0, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 8, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 2, 0, 7, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 3, 7}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8 have 6 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 6 neighbors, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars for each node.
- Therefore, for nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8, we have a total of 20*6 = 120 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with the sets {1, 4, 0} and {1, 0, 2}, which are the maximum possible.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [120].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <6, (1, 4, 0)>
- <6, (1, 0, 2)>
