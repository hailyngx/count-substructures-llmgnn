Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 24) (13, 0) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 21) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 14) (25, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (10, 1) (10, 20) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 26) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 24) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 28) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 28) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 19) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 18) (28, 7) (28, 29) (29, 28) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 15) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 23) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 27) (19, 12) (19, 21) (19, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (27, 1) (23, 18) (23, 24) (23, 4) (20, 10) (20, 2) (20, 12) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 15) (15, 21) (15, 4) (16, 1) (16, 6) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 6) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 26) (11, 5) (11, 25) (11, 26) 

Response:
Given the information, we first need to determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors (13, 9)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (10, 17, 16, 27)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (5, 18, 20, 24, 14)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (25, 12)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (19, 23, 15)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (9, 2, 11)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (13, 16, 26)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (8, 12, 28, 6)
- Node 8: 2 neighbors (13, 7)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (5, 0, 12, 14)
- Node 10: 2 neighbors (1, 20)
- Node 11: 3 neighbors (5, 25, 26)
- Node 12: 5 neighbors (9, 3, 7, 20, 19)
- Node 13: 5 neighbors (22, 8, 24, 0, 6)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (25, 2, 9)
- Node 15: 2 neighbors (21, 4)
- Node 16: 2 neighbors (1, 6)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (1, 28, 26)
- Node 18: 3 neighbors (2, 23, 28)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (12, 21, 4)
- Node 20: 3 neighbors (10, 2, 12)
- Node 21: 3 neighbors (22, 19, 15)
- Node 22: 3 neighbors (13, 28, 21)
- Node 23: 3 neighbors (18, 24, 4)
- Node 24: 3 neighbors (13, 2, 23)
- Node 25: 3 neighbors (3, 14, 11)
- Node 26: 3 neighbors (17, 11, 6)
- Node 27: 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 28: 5 neighbors (22, 17, 18, 7, 29)
- Node 29: 1 neighbor (28)

We can see that nodes 1, 2, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 28 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these together: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
