Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {4, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 8, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 6, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 7, 9, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 1 has exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 1, 5 has exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 2, 14 has exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 3, 10, 12 has exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 4, 6, 11 has exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 5, 7 has exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 8, 11, 13 has exactly 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 9, 2, 14 has more than 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 0, 13, 14 has more than 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

There are a total of 9 different 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 5>, 
<1, 5, 7>, 
<2, 9, 14>, 
<3, 10, 12>, 
<4, 6, 11>, 
<5, 0, 13>, 
<8, 11, 13>, 
<9, 2, 14>, 
<0, 13, 14>.
