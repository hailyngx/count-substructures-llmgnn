Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 8) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. **List of Neighbors for Each Node**:
   
   - Node 0: {3, 6, 8, 11, 12}
   - Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 9, 14}
   - Node 2: {1, 8}
   - Node 3: {0, 4}
   - Node 4: {3, 7, 11, 13}
   - Node 5: {1, 10, 12, 13, 14}
   - Node 6: {0, 7, 9, 10}
   - Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8}
   - Node 8: {0, 2, 7, 11, 13}
   - Node 9: {1, 6, 11, 13}
   - Node 10: {5, 6, 12, 13}
   - Node 11: {0, 4, 8, 9}
   - Node 12: {0, 5, 10, 13}
   - Node 13: {4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12}
   - Node 14: {1, 5}

2. **Counting 3-Stars**:
   
   - Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: {7, 13, 3} (1 3-star)
   - Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: {1, 4, 6} (1 3-star)
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: {2, 5, 9} (1 3-star)
   - Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: {0, 11, 13} (1 3-star)
   - Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: {12, 13, 14} (1 3-star)
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: {9, 10, 0} (1 3-star)
   - Node 13 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: {10, 12, 9} (1 3-star)

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [7].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <4, 7, 13, 3>
- <7, 1, 4, 6>
- <1, 2, 5, 9>
- <8, 0, 11, 13>
- <5, 12, 13, 14>
- <6, 0, 9, 10>
- <13, 9, 10, 12>
