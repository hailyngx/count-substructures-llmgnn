Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 5, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 
\( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 4, 9>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <8, 3, 9>
- <8, 4, 5>
- <8, 4, 9>
- <8, 5, 9>
- <8, 9, 5>
- <9, 3, 6>
- <9, 3, 8>
- <9, 5, 7>
