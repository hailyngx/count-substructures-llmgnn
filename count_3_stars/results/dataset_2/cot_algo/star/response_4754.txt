Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 15) (29, 14) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 15) (22, 17) (0, 1) (27, 12) (12, 27) (12, 21) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 28) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 25) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 10) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 10) (7, 19) (7, 3) (16, 19) (16, 21) (16, 6) (21, 12) (21, 16) (21, 11) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 10) (4, 25) (4, 6) (23, 18) (23, 6) (23, 24) (9, 28) (25, 1) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 28) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 3) (28, 20) (28, 9) (28, 25) (5, 10) (5, 3) (5, 25) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 21) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 15) (15, 29) (15, 22) (15, 6) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 23) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 1
- Node 1: 0, 26, 25
- Node 2: 29, 13, 24
- Node 3: 7, 13, 5
- Node 4: 10, 25, 6
- Node 5: 10, 3, 25
- Node 6: 16, 4, 23, 15
- Node 7: 19, 3
- Node 8: 29, 19, 11
- Node 9: 28
- Node 10: 26, 14, 4, 5
- Node 11: 17, 8, 21
- Node 12: 27, 21
- Node 13: 2, 18, 3
- Node 14: 29, 26, 24, 10
- Node 15: 29, 22, 6
- Node 16: 19, 21, 6
- Node 17: 29, 22, 20, 11
- Node 18: 22, 23, 20, 13
- Node 19: 8, 7, 16
- Node 20: 18, 17, 28
- Node 21: 12, 16, 11
- Node 22: 18, 15, 17
- Node 23: 18, 6, 24
- Node 24: 2, 14, 23
- Node 25: 1, 4, 28, 5
- Node 26: 1, 14, 10
- Node 27: 12
- Node 28: 20, 9, 25
- Node 29: 2, 17, 8, 15, 14

Now, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

- Node 2: <2, (13, 24, 29)>
- Node 8: <8, (11, 19, 29)> 
- Node 14: <14, (10, 24, 29)>
- Node 15: <15, (6, 22, 29)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars found, so the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
