Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 23) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 29) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 23) (6, 26) (9, 22) (9, 12) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (2, 17) (2, 16) (18, 10) (18, 29) (7, 23) (7, 27) (12, 9) (12, 8) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 27) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 5) (26, 6) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 20) (28, 1) (28, 26) (3, 0) (3, 19) (11, 14) (11, 24) (4, 13) (4, 27) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 16) (25, 17) (25, 29) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 16) (20, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 5) (29, 21) (29, 8) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 27) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 13}
Node 1: {6, 23, 28}
Node 2: {16, 17}
Node 3: {0, 19}
Node 4: {13, 27}
Node 5: {10, 13, 20, 22}
Node 6: {1, 14, 23, 26}
Node 7: {23, 24, 27}
Node 8: {10, 12, 13, 18, 29}
Node 9: {12, 22}
Node 10: {5, 8, 18}
Node 11: {14, 24}
Node 12: {8, 9}
Node 13: {0, 1, 4, 5, 8}
Node 14: {6, 11, 16, 17, 19}
Node 15: {16, 19, 26, 29}
Node 16: {2, 14, 19, 27}
Node 17: {2, 14, 25}
Node 18: {8, 10, 29}
Node 19: {3, 14, 15, 16}
Node 20: {5}
Node 21: {13, 24, 29}
Node 22: {5, 9, 26}
Node 23: {1, 6, 7}
Node 24: {7, 11, 21, 27}
Node 25: {17, 29}
Node 26: {6, 15, 22, 28}
Node 27: {4, 7, 16, 24}
Node 28: {1, 26}
Node 29: {8, 15, 18, 21, 25}

Now, let's identify nodes that can form a 3-star:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 23, and 28. 
Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 14, and 26. 
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 18, and 29. 
Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8. 
Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 17, and 19. 
Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 19, and 27. 
Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 15, and 16. 
Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 15, and 22. 
Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 15, and 18. 

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 6, 23, 28>
<6, 1, 14, 26>
<8, 10, 18, 29>
<13, 1, 5, 8>
<14, 16, 17, 19>
<16, 14, 19, 27>
<19, 14, 15, 16>
<26, 6, 15, 22>
<29, 8, 15, 18>
