Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 4) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 11
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 11
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8, 11
- Node 3: 1, 7, 10, 12, 14
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 9, 13
- Node 5: 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9, 11, 14
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8, 10
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7, 14
- Node 9: 4, 6, 13
- Node 10: 3, 7, 12, 13
- Node 11: 0, 1, 2, 6, 12
- Node 12: 3, 10, 11
- Node 13: 4, 9, 10
- Node 14: 3, 6, 8

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars present in this graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 11 <0, (1, 4, 11)>.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 8 <2, (4, 5, 8)>.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 10, and 12 <3, (7, 10, 12)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 13 <4, (6, 9, 13)>.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 13 <10, (3, 7, 13)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 5, so the final answer is [5].
