Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 12) (27, 6) (27, 13) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 7) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 18) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 8) (25, 4) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 11) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 29) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 15) (13, 27) (13, 5) (13, 6) (7, 1) (7, 11) (29, 20) (29, 26) (29, 21) (28, 22) (28, 14) (14, 28) (14, 2) (18, 3) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 24) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 22) (24, 0) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 4) (15, 26) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 9) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 4) (9, 15) (22, 17) (22, 28) (22, 11) (22, 8) (8, 25) (8, 22) (8, 6) (12, 0) (12, 24) (12, 21) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 23) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 2) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 21) (6, 27) (6, 13) (6, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 16, 24, 12
- Node 1: 26, 17, 7
- Node 2: 10, 14, 21
- Node 3: 23, 5, 18
- Node 4: 25, 24, 23
- Node 5: 3, 13, 18, 15
- Node 6: 27, 13, 8
- Node 7: 1, 11
- Node 8: 25, 22, 6
- Node 9: 15
- Node 10: 2
- Node 11: 20, 17, 7, 22
- Node 12: 0, 24, 21
- Node 13: 27, 5, 6
- Node 14: 28, 2
- Node 15: 26, 5, 18, 19, 9
- Node 16: 0, 18, 24
- Node 17: 1, 23, 22, 11
- Node 18: 3, 5, 19, 16, 15
- Node 19: 18, 15
- Node 20: 25, 29, 11
- Node 21: 29, 12, 2
- Node 22: 17, 28, 11, 8
- Node 23: 3, 17, 4
- Node 24: 0, 16, 12, 4
- Node 25: 20, 8, 4
- Node 26: 1, 29, 15
- Node 27: 6, 13
- Node 28: 22, 14
- Node 29: 20, 26, 21

Node 18, with its neighbors (3, 5, 19, 16, 15), has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 15, with its neighbors (26, 5, 18, 19, 9), has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 = 20 \), which can be written as [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <18, (3, 5, 19)>
- <18, (3, 5, 16)>
- <18, (3, 5, 15)>
- <18, (19, 5, 16)>
- <18, (19, 5, 15)>
- <18, (19, 16, 15)>
- <18, (3, 16, 15)>
- <18, (5, 16, 15)>
- <15, (26, 5, 19)>
- <15, (26, 5, 9)>
- <15, (26, 19, 9)>
- <15, (5, 19, 9)>
- <15, (18, 5, 19)>
- <15, (18, 5, 9)>
- <15, (18, 19, 9)>
- <15, (5, 19, 9)>
- <15, (18, 5, 9)>
- <15, (18, 19, 9)>
