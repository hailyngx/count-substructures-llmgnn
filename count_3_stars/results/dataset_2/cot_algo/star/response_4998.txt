Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 2) (6, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 1, 9}
- Node 1: {11, 7, 5, 0, 12}
- Node 2: {10, 13, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {11, 7, 14}
- Node 4: {10, 8, 9, 2}
- Node 5: {10, 8, 12, 1}
- Node 6: {2, 14}
- Node 7: {13, 3, 9, 1}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 9, 5, 0}
- Node 9: {11, 8, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {11, 4, 2, 5}
- Node 11: {10, 3, 1, 9}
- Node 12: {5, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 2, 14, 7}
- Node 14: {13, 3, 2, 1, 6}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (11, 7, 5)
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (10, 13, 4)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (10, 8, 9)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (10, 8, 12)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (13, 3, 9)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (13, 4, 9)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (11, 8, 4)
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (11, 4, 2)
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (8, 2, 14)
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with these neighbors: (13, 3, 2)

By counting the 3-stars formed by these nodes, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, 7, 5>
- <2, 10, 13>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <5, 8, 12>
- <7, 13, 9>
- <8, 13, 4>
- <9, 11, 4>
- <10, 11, 2>
- <13, 8, 14>
- <14, 13, 3>
