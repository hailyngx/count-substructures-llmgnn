Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 6) (8, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 18) (13, 1) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 9) (4, 6) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 9) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 13, 12, 19}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 15}
- Node 3: {16, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 14, 9, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 17, 0}
- Node 6: {10, 8, 0, 4}
- Node 7: {11, 19, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 18}
- Node 9: {7, 4, 19}
- Node 10: {17, 6, 14}
- Node 11: {16, 14, 7}
- Node 12: {16, 1, 2, 18}
- Node 13: {1}
- Node 14: {11, 10, 4}
- Node 15: {16, 2, 18}
- Node 16: {11, 15, 12, 3}
- Node 17: {10, 5}
- Node 18: {8, 15, 12}
- Node 19: {1, 7, 9}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1, 12, 19 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 3, 4, 6, 15, 16, 18 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 1 3-star each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 3 \times 4 + 6 = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 13, 19)>, <12, (1, 2, 18)>, <19, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (16, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 14, 9)>, <6, (10, 8, 0)>, <15, (16, 2, 18)>, and <16, (11, 15, 12)>.
