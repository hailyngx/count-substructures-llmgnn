Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's start by finding the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 10, 11, 2, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 12, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {8, 4, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 5: {7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. Nodes 0, 2, 7, 9, 11, 13 are the nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- For node 2: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
- For node 7: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- For node 9: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- For node 11: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- For node 13: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)

Adding these up gives a total of 74 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the final result is [74].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 7, 11>
- <2, 7, 11>
- <1, 4, 13>
- <9, 11, 13>
