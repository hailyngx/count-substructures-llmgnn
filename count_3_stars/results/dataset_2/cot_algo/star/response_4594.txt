Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 8) (14, 7) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (1, 11) (1, 5) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 2) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 4) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 18) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 10) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 4) (10, 7) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 3) (19, 17) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 15, 18, 13, 2, 12  
Node 1: 11, 5  
Node 2: 0, 16, 12, 5  
Node 3: 19, 8, 4  
Node 4: 3, 6, 10  
Node 5: 1, 2, 7  
Node 6: 17, 16, 4  
Node 7: 14, 5, 10  
Node 8: 3, 14, 16, 11, 18  
Node 9: 17, 12, 18  
Node 10: 4, 7  
Node 11: 1, 8  
Node 12: 0, 2, 13, 9  
Node 13: 15, 12, 18  
Node 14: 8, 7  
Node 15: 0, 18, 13  
Node 16: 8, 2, 6  
Node 17: 6, 9, 19  
Node 18: 15, 9, 13, 8  
Node 19: 3, 17  

Now, let's check the number of neighbors for each node:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 18
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: none

Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{8}{3} = 56 \]

So, the final number of 3-stars in the given graph is [56].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 15, 18>, <0, 15, 13>, <0, 18, 13>, <2, 0, 12>, <2, 0, 13>, <2, 12, 13>, <5, 1, 7>, <5, 2, 7>, <5, 7, 10>, <6, 4, 10>, <6, 4, 17>, <6, 16, 17>, <8, 3, 4>, <8, 3, 11>, <8, 3, 18>, <8, 4, 11>, <8, 4, 18>, <8, 16, 6>, <8, 16, 17>, <8, 16, 18>, <8, 6, 16>, <8, 18, 13>, <8, 18, 15>, <12, 0, 13>, <12, 0, 9>
