Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 14) (20, 9) (20, 5) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 18) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 27) (2, 24) (2, 11) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 0) (22, 28) (22, 7) (11, 2) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 14) (28, 4) (3, 13) (24, 26) (24, 2) (24, 19) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 8) (17, 28) (17, 4) (23, 9) (23, 25) (23, 11) (10, 20) (10, 16) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 29) (21, 4) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 15) (5, 20) (5, 14) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 1) (14, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (7, 22) (7, 13) (13, 3) (13, 21) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 27) (8, 1) (6, 25) (6, 18) (4, 28) (4, 17) (4, 21) (4, 29) (19, 24) (27, 2) (27, 21) (27, 13) (29, 21) (29, 4) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 9: {26, 15, 20, 1, 23}
- Node 26: {9, 24, 14}
- Node 20: {9, 5, 10}
- Node 25: {6, 23, 18}
- Node 2: {18, 12, 27, 24, 11}
- Node 18: {25, 2, 6, 0}
- Node 22: {28, 7}
- Node 11: {2, 28, 23, 0}
- Node 28: {22, 11, 17, 14, 4}
- Node 3: {13}
- Node 24: {26, 2, 19}
- Node 1: {9, 14, 8}
- Node 17: {28, 4}
- Node 23: {9, 25, 11}
- Node 10: {20, 16}
- Node 21: {13, 27, 29, 4}
- Node 0: {18, 11, 16, 12}
- Node 16: {10, 0, 15}
- Node 5: {20, 14}
- Node 14: {26, 28, 1, 5}
- Node 12: {2, 0}
- Node 7: {22, 13}
- Node 13: {3, 21, 7, 15, 27}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 6: {25, 18}
- Node 4: {28, 17, 21, 29}
- Node 19: {24}
- Node 27: {2, 21, 13}
- Node 29: {21, 4}
- Node 15: {9, 16, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 26: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 20: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 28: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 21: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [60].

Unique 3-stars:

- <9, 26, 15>
- <9, 26, 1>
- <9, 26, 23>
- <9, 20, 5>
- <9, 20, 10>
- <9, 2, 18>
- <9, 2, 12>
