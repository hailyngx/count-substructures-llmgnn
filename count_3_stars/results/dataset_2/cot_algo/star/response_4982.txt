Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 9, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 7, 6, 3}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 7, 1}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 2, 6, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 2, 8, 1, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9, 4, 7, 1}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 6, 2, 1, 3}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 6, 2, 0}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

For these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 60

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [60].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 2, 9)>, 
<1, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<2, (5, 4, 7)>, 
<4, (7, 6, 3)>, 
<5, (9, 6, 2, 8)>, 
<6, (9, 4, 7, 1)>, 
<7, (4, 6, 2, 1)>, 
<9, (5, 6, 2)>.
