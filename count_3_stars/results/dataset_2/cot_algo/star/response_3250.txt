Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 17) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (18, 19) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (15, 1) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 13) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 17) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {4, 8, 9, 6}
Node 1: {10, 11, 13, 15}
Node 2: {3, 12, 13, 19}
Node 3: {2, 12, 17}
Node 4: {0, 6, 9, 10}
Node 5: {12, 14, 17, 19}
Node 6: {0, 4, 8, 16}
Node 7: {17}
Node 8: {0, 6, 19}
Node 9: {0, 4, 13, 14}
Node 10: {1, 4}
Node 11: {1, 19}
Node 12: {2, 3, 5}
Node 13: {1, 2, 9}
Node 14: {5, 9}
Node 15: {1}
Node 16: {6, 17}
Node 17: {3, 5, 7, 16}
Node 18: {19}
Node 19: {2, 5, 8, 11, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 0: 4, 8, 9, 6
Node 4: 0, 6, 9, 10
Node 6: 0, 4, 8, 16
Node 9: 0, 4, 13, 14
Node 10: 1, 4
Node 17: 3, 5, 7, 16
Node 19: 2, 5, 8, 11, 18

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 10: 1 3-star
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 13)>
<10, (1, 4)>
<17, (3, 5, 7)>
<19, (2, 5, 8)>
