Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 2
- Node 1: 0, 12, 7
- Node 2: 0, 14
- Node 3: 11, 0, 10
- Node 4: 8, 12, 13, 11
- Node 5: 9, 10, 14
- Node 6: 8, 7, 11, 0, 14, 13
- Node 7: 1, 12, 6, 13
- Node 8: 4, 10, 11, 6
- Node 9: 5, 14, 13, 12
- Node 10: 5, 3, 8, 13
- Node 11: 3, 4, 8, 6
- Node 12: 9, 1, 4, 7, 13
- Node 13: 9, 4, 7, 12, 10, 6
- Node 14: 5, 9, 2, 6

We see that nodes 6 and 13 each have 6 neighbors, so they will form 3-stars. 

Now let's list out the unique 3-stars: 
<6, (0, 7, 14)>, <6, (8, 11, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
