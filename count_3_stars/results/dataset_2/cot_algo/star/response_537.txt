Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 6, 2, 13}
- Node 1: {11, 10}
- Node 2: {8, 12, 11, 0}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 13, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 12, 13, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 11, 4, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 12}
- Node 8: {6, 3, 2, 14, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 2}
- Node 13: {4, 3, 0, 10}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 11, 14} (Total: 1)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 11, 14} (Total: 1)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 12, 13} (Total: 1)
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 9, 13} (Total: 1)

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so we put this number inside brackets: [4].
The unique 3-stars found are <5, (9, 11, 14)>, <8, (6, 11, 14)>, <4, (7, 12, 13)>, <0, (6, 9, 13)>
