Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:
For each node, we need to find their neighbors first. Then, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it can form. 
Let's do this step by step:

### Node 0's neighbors: {3, 11, 4}
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, and it can form 1 3-star.

### Node 1's neighbors: {3, 2, 14}
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, and it can form 1 3-star.

### Node 2's neighbors: {6, 1, 18}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, and it can form 1 3-star.

### Node 3's neighbors: {6, 1, 18, 0}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, and it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- The 3-stars are: <3, (1, 6, 18)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 18)>, <3, (0, 6, 18)>.

### Node 4's neighbors: {12, 0, 14, 19}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, and it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- The 3-stars are: <4, (0, 12, 14)>, <4, (0, 12, 19)>, <4, (0, 14, 19)>, <4, (12, 14, 19)>.

### Node 5's neighbors: {6, 11, 19, 15}
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, and it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- The 3-stars are: <5, (6, 11, 15)>, <5, (6, 11, 19)>, <5, (6, 15, 19)>, <5, (11, 15, 19)>.

### Node 6's neighbors: {9, 5, 3, 2}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, and it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- The 3-stars are: <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>.

### Node 8's neighbors: {13, 15, 12}
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, and it can form 1 3-star.

### Node 9's neighbors: {6, 18, 17, 10}
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, and it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- The 3-stars are: <9, (10, 17, 18)>, <9, (6, 10, 17)>, <9, (6, 10, 18)>, <9, (6, 17, 18)>.

### Node 11's neighbors: {10, 0, 13, 5}
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, and it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- The 3-stars are: <11, (0, 5, 10)>, <11, (0, 5, 13)>, <11, (0, 10, 13)>, <11, (5, 10, 13)>.

### Node 12's neighbors: {8, 4, 15}
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, and it can form 1 3-star.

### Node 13's neighbors: {11, 8, 7}
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, and it can form 1 3-star.

### Node 15's neighbors: {8, 5, 12, 16}
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, and it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- The 3-stars are: <15, (8, 12, 16)>, <15, (5, 12, 16)>, <15, (5, 8, 12)>, <15, (5, 8, 16)>.

### Node 18's neighbors: {9, 3, 2}
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, and it can form 1 3-star.

### Node 19's neighbors: {4, 5, 17}
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, and it can form 1 3-star.

### Node 17's neighbors: {9, 19}
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

### Node 10's neighbors: {9, 11}
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

### Node 7's neighbors: {13}
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

### Node 16's neighbors: {15}
- Node 16 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars found, we get a total of 25 3-stars in the graph, which we represent as [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (1, 6, 18)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 18)>, <3, (0, 6, 18)>, <4, (0, 12, 14)>, <4, (0, 12, 19)>, <4, (0, 14, 19)>, <4, (12, 14, 19)>, <5, (6, 11, 15)>, <5, (6, 11, 19)>, <5, (6, 15, 19)>, <5, (11, 15, 19)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (10, 17, 18)>, <9, (6, 10, 17)>, <9, (6, 10, 18)>, <9, (6, 17, 18)>, <11, (0, 5, 10)>, <11, (0, 5, 13)>, <11, (0, 10, 13)>, <11, (5, 10, 13)>, <15, (8, 12, 16)>, <15, (5, 12, 16)>, <15, (5, 8, 12)>, <15, (5, 8, 16)>.
