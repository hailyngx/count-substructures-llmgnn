Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 0) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 7) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 10) (23, 5) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 19) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 10) (4, 26) (8, 4) (8, 15) (15, 8) (15, 29) (15, 24) (20, 17) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 27) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 2) (26, 22) (26, 4) (26, 27) (13, 21) (13, 0) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 22) (11, 3) (11, 17) (17, 20) (17, 11) (17, 19) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 25) (18, 13) (18, 0) (7, 9) (7, 14) (6, 14) (6, 27) (2, 5) (2, 28) (2, 14) (1, 28) (1, 25) (1, 12) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 2) (27, 20) (27, 26) (27, 6) (24, 4) (24, 15) (12, 20) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 0) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 18) (0, 12) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (19, 23) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 16) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 13, 18, 12}
- Node 1: {28, 25, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 28, 14}
- Node 3: {11, 19}
- Node 4: {8, 24, 10, 26}
- Node 5: {2, 23, 0}
- Node 6: {14, 27}
- Node 7: {9, 14}
- Node 8: {4, 15}
- Node 9: {0, 16, 7}
- Node 10: {22, 4, 12}
- Node 11: {22, 3, 17}
- Node 12: {20, 1, 10, 0}
- Node 13: {21, 0, 18}
- Node 14: {7, 6, 2}
- Node 15: {8, 29, 24}
- Node 16: {9, 19}
- Node 17: {20, 11, 19}
- Node 18: {13, 0}
- Node 19: {23, 3, 17, 16}
- Node 20: {17, 29, 12, 27}
- Node 21: {28, 13}
- Node 22: {23, 26, 11, 10}
- Node 23: {5, 22, 25, 19}
- Node 24: {4, 8, 15}
- Node 25: {23, 29, 1}
- Node 26: {22, 4, 27}
- Node 27: {20, 26, 6}
- Node 28: {21, 2, 1}
- Node 29: {15, 20, 25}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 4, Node 5, Node 9, Node 12, Node 19, Node 20, Node 22, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, and Node 29 have 3 or more neighbors.
- Total number of 3-stars = \( \binom{12}{3} + \binom{11}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} \)
- Total number of 3-stars = 220 + 165 + 120 + 220 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 56 + 20 + 1 + 1
- Total number of 3-stars = 821

Therefore, the final answer is [821].
