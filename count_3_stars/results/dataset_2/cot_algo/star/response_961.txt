Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
Based on the given edges and nodes information, we can find the 3-star graphs in this network. 

First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 3, 11}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 11, 2, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 7, 6, 1, 13}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 12, 1, 11, 0, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 11, 2, 13}
- Node 8: {10}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 10, 3}
- Node 10: {9, 5, 8}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 6, 0, 1}
- Node 12: {5, 7, 13}
- Node 13: {7, 6, 12, 14, 2}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 13}

Now, we can see that the following nodes have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors
- Node 13: 5 neighbors

Next, we count the total number of 3-star graphs:
- Total number of 3-star graphs = \( \sum_{\text{nodes with 3 or more neighbors}} \binom{n}{3} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 83$

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given network is [83].

The unique 3-star graphs found are:
- <0, (5, 3, 11)>
- <1, (5, 6, 11)>
- <1, (5, 11, 14)>
- <1, (2, 6, 13)>
- <2, (9, 4, 7)>
- <5, (9, 12, 10)>
- <5, (12, 7, 13)>
- <9, (2, 10, 3)>
- <11, (7, 6, 13)>
