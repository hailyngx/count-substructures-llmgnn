Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 3, 6, 14, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 3, 13, 8}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 10, 9, 0}
- Node 4: {12, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {7, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 11, 8, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 6, 2, 9, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 11, 8, 0, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 3, 12}
- Node 11: {7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 11, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 2, 0}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets: <0, (3, 6, 9)> and <0, (7, 14, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (7, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 10, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (10, 12, 14)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (7, 13, 14)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (2, 8, 0)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 11, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (11, 13, 12)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [8].
