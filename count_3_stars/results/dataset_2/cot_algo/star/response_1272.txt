Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 2}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 13, 12, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 9, 0, 4, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {14, 11, 10, 4}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 3, 2, 10, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 2, 0, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {12, 14, 2, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 8, 13, 12, 10}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 4, 2, 14, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {13, 7, 12, 3, 4}
- Node 11: Neighbors {13, 3}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 7, 10, 6, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 11, 1, 10, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 3, 6, 1}

From the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 13 have 3 or more neighbors and can form 3-stars. Each of these nodes can form \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars, where \( n \) is the number of neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formable from these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 74

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (8, 13, 1)>
- <2, (5, 9, 2)>
- <4, (9, 3, 4)>
- <7, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (5, 9, 12)>
- <10, (10, 12, 13)>
- <12, (7, 12, 14)>
- <13, (7, 10, 13)>
