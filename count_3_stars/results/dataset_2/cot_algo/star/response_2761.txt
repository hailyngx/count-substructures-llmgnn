Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (12, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 13) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 10) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 18) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors: 5
- Node 1: Neighbors: 4, 6, 10, 19
- Node 2: Neighbors: 9, 18
- Node 3: Neighbors: 7, 11, 19
- Node 4: Neighbors: 1, 8, 15, 18
- Node 5: Neighbors: 0, 10, 11, 15
- Node 6: Neighbors: 1, 13, 19
- Node 7: Neighbors: 3, 8, 11, 16
- Node 8: Neighbors: 4, 7, 17
- Node 9: Neighbors: 2, 13, 14
- Node 10: Neighbors: 1, 5
- Node 11: Neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 16, 17
- Node 12: Neighbors: 16
- Node 13: Neighbors: 6, 9, 15
- Node 14: Neighbors: 9, 16
- Node 15: Neighbors: 4, 5, 13
- Node 16: Neighbors: 7, 11, 12, 14
- Node 17: Neighbors: 8, 11, 18
- Node 18: Neighbors: 2, 4, 17
- Node 19: Neighbors: 1, 3, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 11: (5, 7, 16), (3, 7, 16), (3, 5, 16), (3, 5, 17), (7, 8, 17)
- Node 1: (4, 6, 19)
- Node 4: (8, 15, 18)
- Node 5: (0, 10, 15)
- Node 7: (8, 11, 17)
- Node 9: (13, 14, 16)
- Node 13: (15, 9, 6)

The total number of 3-stars is 7, so the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, 7, 16>
- <3, 7, 16>
- <3, 5, 16>
- <3, 5, 17>
- <7, 8, 17>
- <4, 6, 19>
- <8, 15, 18>
