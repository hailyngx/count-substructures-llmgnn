Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 

Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}
Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 9}
Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 8}
Node 5: {1, 8}
Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
Node 7: {2, 8}
Node 8: {0, 4, 5, 7}
Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6}

Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 6 have 5, 5, 4, 4, and 5 neighbors respectively, meaning they can form 10, 10, 4, 4, and 10 3-stars respectively. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
