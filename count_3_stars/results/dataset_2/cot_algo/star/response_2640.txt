Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {5, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 8, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 11}
- Node 7: {8, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 11}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 6, 9, 13, 5}
- Node 12: {3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 10, 11, 0}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 5, 8}

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 13, 14}: <1, (3, 13, 14)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 4, 6}: <3, (1, 4, 6)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {10, 11, 14}: <5, (10, 11, 14)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 12, 14}: <8, (7, 12, 14)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with neighbors {5, 7, 13}: <10, (5, 7, 13)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 9, 13}: <11, (2, 9, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6, so the final answer is [6].
