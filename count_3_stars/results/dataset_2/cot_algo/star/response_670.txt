Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 13) 

Response:
Given a graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 1: {0, 4, 8, 13}
Node 2: {7, 10, 12, 14}
Node 3: {6, 9, 11}
Node 4: {0, 1, 6, 9}
Node 5: {7, 10, 14}
Node 6: {3, 4, 11, 13}
Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 9, 13}
Node 8: {0, 1, 10, 12}
Node 9: {3, 4, 7, 11}
Node 10: {2, 5, 8, 11, 14}
Node 11: {3, 6, 9, 10, 12}
Node 12: {2, 8, 11, 13}
Node 13: {1, 6, 7, 12}
Node 14: {2, 5, 10}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- Node 0: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 1: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star (2, 5, 14)
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star (3, 6, 11)
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star (4, 6, 9)
- Node 5: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star (6, 3, 11)
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star (7, 5, 14)
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star (8, 2, 12)
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star (9, 3, 11)
- Node 10: Forms 1 3-star (10, 2, 14)
- Node 11: Forms 1 3-star (11, 3, 6)
- Node 12: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 13: Does not form any 3-star
- Node 14: Does not form any 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 8
Therefore, the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, 5, 14>, 
<3, 6, 11>, 
<4, 6, 9>, 
<7, 5, 14>, 
<8, 2, 12>, 
<9, 3, 11>, 
<10, 2, 14>, 
<11, 3, 6>.
