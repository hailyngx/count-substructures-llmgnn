Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 20) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 3) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 18) (20, 22) (20, 24) (25, 27) (25, 17) (18, 2) (18, 29) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 23) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 0) (8, 3) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 0) (24, 17) (24, 21) (26, 24) (26, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 21) (21, 8) (21, 24) (21, 3) (1, 15) (1, 27) (15, 1) (15, 11) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 1) (27, 10) (17, 25) (17, 5) (17, 24) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 27) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 24) (23, 28) (23, 14) (7, 29) (4, 19) (4, 11) (9, 16) (19, 28) (19, 4) (12, 18) (12, 14) (16, 13) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 9) (14, 5) (14, 28) (14, 23) (14, 12) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 15) (11, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 22, 24}
- Node 1: {15, 27}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 18, 29}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 21}
- Node 4: {11, 19}
- Node 5: {6, 14, 17}
- Node 6: {5, 11, 16, 28}
- Node 7: {29}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 21}
- Node 9: {16}
- Node 10: {26, 27, 29}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 13, 15}
- Node 12: {14, 18}
- Node 13: {11, 16, 22}
- Node 14: {5, 12, 23, 28}
- Node 15: {1, 11}
- Node 16: {6, 9, 13, 22}
- Node 17: {5, 24, 25}
- Node 18: {2, 12, 29}
- Node 19: {4, 28}
- Node 20: {22, 24}
- Node 21: {3, 8, 24}
- Node 22: {0, 13, 16, 20}
- Node 23: {14, 28}
- Node 24: {0, 20, 21, 25}
- Node 25: {17, 24, 27}
- Node 26: {10, 24}
- Node 27: {1, 10, 25, 29}
- Node 28: {6, 14, 19, 23}
- Node 29: {2, 7, 10, 18, 27}

Applying the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula to nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we see that nodes with 3 neighbors can form only 1 3-star: Node 22.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <22, (13, 16, 20)>.
