Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 6) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 7) (7, 12) (7, 27) (7, 6) (7, 13) (0, 22) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 8) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 5) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 26) (28, 27) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 15) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 22) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 4) (29, 9) (29, 11) (29, 18) (10, 14) (10, 22) (15, 28) (15, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (22, 10) (22, 19) (18, 29) (18, 15) (19, 22) (19, 11) (25, 9) (25, 6) (11, 29) (11, 19) (11, 24) (11, 26) (24, 16) (24, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (6, 25) (6, 26) (5, 20) (5, 23) (5, 21) (23, 14) (23, 5) (26, 16) (26, 11) (26, 6) (26, 21) (3, 27) (3, 20) (3, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (21, 5) (21, 26) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {22}
- Node 1: {13, 16, 28}
- Node 2: (not listed, so degree 0)
- Node 3: {4, 20, 27}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 13, 28}
- Node 5: {20, 21, 23}
- Node 6: {7, 12, 25, 26}
- Node 7: {6, 12, 13, 27}
- Node 8: {9, 17, 22}
- Node 9: {4, 8, 25, 29}
- Node 10: {14, 22}
- Node 11: {19, 24, 26, 29}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 27}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 7, 16}
- Node 14: {10, 20, 23}
- Node 15: {18, 28}
- Node 16: {1, 13, 24, 26, 28}
- Node 17: {8, 20}
- Node 18: {15, 29}
- Node 19: {11, 22}
- Node 20: {3, 5, 14, 17}
- Node 21: {5, 26}
- Node 22: {0, 8, 10, 19}
- Node 23: {5, 14}
- Node 24: {11, 16}
- Node 25: {6, 9}
- Node 26: {6, 11, 21}
- Node 27: {3, 7, 12, 28}
- Node 28: {1, 4, 15, 16, 27}
- Node 29: {9, 11, 18}

Now, let's identify 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: <1, 13, 28>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: <3, 4, 27>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <4, 13, 28>, <4, 9, 28>, <4, 13, 1>, <4, 13, 7>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <6, 7, 12>, <6, 7, 25>, <6, 7, 26>, <6, 25, 26>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <7, 6, 12>, <7, 6, 13>, <7, 12, 27>, <7, 13, 16>
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <9, 4, 28>, <9, 4, 13>, <9, 4, 8>, <9, 4, 25>
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <11, 19, 26>, <11, 24, 26>, <11, 24, 16>, <11, 26, 21>
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <13, 4, 7>, <13, 4, 16>, <13, 1, 4>, <13, 1, 7>
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <16, 1, 13>, <16, 1, 28>, <16, 1, 4>, <16, 1, 7>, <16, 13, 4>, <16, 13, 7>, <16, 13, 1>, <16, 4, 28>, <16, 4, 13>, <16, 4, 7>
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <20, 3, 4>, <20, 3, 5>, <20, 3, 27>, <20, 5, 23>
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <22, 8, 10>, <22, 8, 19>, <22, 8, 0>, <22, 19, 11>
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <26, 6, 21>, <26, 6, 11>, <26, 6, 16>, <26, 11, 21>
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars: <28, 1, 4>, <28, 1, 16>, <28, 1, 13>, <28, 4, 16>, <28, 4, 13>, <28, 4, 15>, <28, 4, 27>, <28, 15, 18>, <28, 15, 16>, <28, 27, 3>
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <29, 9, 11>, <29, 9, 18>, <29, 9, 25>, <29, 11, 19>

Counting all these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [36].
