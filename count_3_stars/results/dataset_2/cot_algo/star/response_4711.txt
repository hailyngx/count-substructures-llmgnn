Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 11) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {13}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 8, 12}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 4: {6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 3, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 9, 12, 4, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 10, 13}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 12: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 92 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [92], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 13>, <1, 5, 3>, <1, 5, 12>, <1, 5, 11>, <2, 6, 12>, <2, 6, 4>, <2, 6, 10>, <3, 5, 13>, <3, 5, 12>, <4, 6, 13>, <4, 6, 10>, <4, 6, 14>, <4, 6, 9>, <4, 6, 11>, <4, 13, 9>, <4, 13, 14>, <4, 13, 10>, <5, 13, 14>, <5, 13, 9>, <6, 10, 14>
