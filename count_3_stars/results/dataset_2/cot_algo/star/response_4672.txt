Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 15) (21, 29) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 27) (15, 21) (15, 3) (15, 9) (18, 23) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 16) (22, 24) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 25) (17, 5) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 25) (28, 1) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 25) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 19) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 2) (20, 29) (20, 4) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 20) (19, 13) (19, 23) (19, 9) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 12) (4, 10) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 12) (27, 3) (27, 11) (27, 4) (12, 1) (12, 23) (12, 4) (12, 9) (25, 17) (25, 0) (25, 14) (25, 5) (7, 1) (7, 23) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 11) (8, 16) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 12) (9, 24) (24, 22) (24, 9) (6, 10) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided about the graph, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: 2, 14, 25
- Node 1 neighbors: 7, 12, 21, 28
- Node 2 neighbors: 0, 11, 13
- Node 3 neighbors: 11, 15, 27, 28
- Node 4 neighbors: 10, 12, 20, 27
- Node 5 neighbors: 10, 13, 17, 25
- Node 6 neighbors: 10
- Node 7 neighbors: 1, 23
- Node 8 neighbors: 11, 16
- Node 9 neighbors: 12, 15, 19, 24
- Node 10 neighbors: 4, 5, 6
- Node 11 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 27
- Node 12 neighbors: 1, 4, 9, 23
- Node 13 neighbors: 2, 5, 16, 19
- Node 14 neighbors: 0, 25
- Node 15 neighbors: 3, 9, 21
- Node 16 neighbors: 8, 13, 22
- Node 17 neighbors: 5, 25
- Node 18 neighbors: 23, 28, 29
- Node 19 neighbors: 13, 23
- Node 20 neighbors: 4, 29
- Node 21 neighbors: 1, 15, 28, 29
- Node 22 neighbors: 16, 24
- Node 23 neighbors: 7, 12, 18, 19
- Node 24 neighbors: 9, 22
- Node 25 neighbors: 0, 5, 14, 17
- Node 27 neighbors: 3, 4, 11
- Node 28 neighbors: 1, 3, 18, 21
- Node 29 neighbors: 20, 21, 18

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 11 3-stars in total. Therefore, the answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, 7, 12, 21>
<3, 11, 15, 27>
<4, 10, 12, 27>
<5, 10, 13, 17>
<9, 12, 15, 19>
<12, 1, 4, 23>
<13, 2, 5, 16>
<15, 3, 9>
<16, 8, 13>
<23, 7, 12, 18>
<25, 0, 5, 14>
