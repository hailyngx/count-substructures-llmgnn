Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's define the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5}

Now we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the final answer is [58].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 4, 5)>
