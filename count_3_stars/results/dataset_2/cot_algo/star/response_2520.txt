Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 28) (22, 14) (22, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 17) (6, 20) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 19) (1, 5) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 7) (12, 4) (29, 17) (29, 11) (4, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 25) (16, 25) (16, 18) (16, 10) (28, 13) (28, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 23) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 27) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 24) (23, 14) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 24) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (15, 26) (15, 8) (20, 6) (20, 7) (20, 18) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (25, 14) (25, 19) (25, 16) (25, 18) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 25) (24, 10) (24, 23) (11, 5) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {7, 10, 23, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 21, 18}
- Node 2: {9}
- Node 3: {13, 22, 5, 27}
- Node 4: {12}
- Node 5: {19, 1, 11, 3}
- Node 6: {17, 20}
- Node 7: {12, 0, 20, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 0, 15, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 12}
- Node 10: {16, 0, 24}
- Node 11: {5, 29, 26, 8}
- Node 12: {9, 21, 7, 4}
- Node 13: {17, 3, 28}
- Node 14: {22, 17, 23, 25}
- Node 15: {26, 8}
- Node 16: {25, 18, 10}
- Node 17: {13, 6, 14, 29, 19}
- Node 18: {1, 16, 20, 25}
- Node 19: {5, 17, 25}
- Node 20: {6, 7, 18}
- Node 21: {1, 12}
- Node 22: {14, 3}
- Node 23: {14, 0, 26, 24}
- Node 24: {10, 23}
- Node 25: {14, 19, 16, 18}
- Node 26: {23, 15, 11}
- Node 27: {3, 28}
- Node 28: {13, 27}
- Node 29: {17, 11}

Now, for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed. In this case, only the following nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 18 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 23 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 14. Therefore, the answer is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, 13, 22>
- <5, 1, 11>
- <8, 7, 11>
- <11, 8, 26>
- <12, 7, 21>
- <14, 22, 17>
- <14, 22, 23>
- <14, 17, 19>
- <14, 17, 25>
- <16, 18, 25>
- <17, 13, 28>
- <18, 1, 25>
- <19, 5, 25>
- <23, 24, 26>
