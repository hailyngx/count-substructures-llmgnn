Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: Neighbors are 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
Node 1: Neighbors are 0, 5, 8
Node 2: Neighbors are 3, 7, 9
Node 3: Neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
Node 4: Neighbors are 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 5: Neighbors are 1, 4, 9
Node 6: Neighbors are 0, 4, 7
Node 7: Neighbors are 2, 4, 6, 8
Node 8: Neighbors are 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 9: Neighbors are 2, 3, 4, 5

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 10 + 20 = 40.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 7>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
