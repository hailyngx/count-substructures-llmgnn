Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 16) (3, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 8) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 2) (8, 15) (8, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 18) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 0) (13, 3) (13, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {17, 19, 2}
- Node 1: {15, 6, 4}
- Node 2: {0, 19, 14}
- Node 3: {16, 13}
- Node 4: {16, 5, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 4, 17}
- Node 6: {11, 1, 10}
- Node 7: {12, 15, 18, 17}
- Node 8: {15, 14}
- Node 9: {11, 5, 12}
- Node 10: {12, 6, 18}
- Node 11: {9, 6, 17}
- Node 12: {9, 7, 10, 15}
- Node 13: {3, 19}
- Node 14: {8, 18, 2}
- Node 15: {1, 7, 12, 8}
- Node 16: {3, 4}
- Node 17: {11, 5, 7, 0}
- Node 18: {7, 14, 10}
- Node 19: {0, 2, 13}

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: {17, 19, 2} -> 1 3-star
- Node 1: {15, 6, 4} -> 1 3-star
- Node 2: {0, 19, 14} -> 1 3-star
- Node 4: {16, 5, 1} -> 1 3-star
- Node 5: {9, 4, 17} -> 1 3-star
- Node 6: {11, 1, 10} -> 1 3-star
- Node 7: {12, 15, 18, 17} -> 1 3-star
- Node 12: {9, 7, 10, 15} -> 1 3-star
- Node 14: {8, 18, 2} -> 1 3-star
- Node 15: {1, 7, 12, 8} -> 1 3-star
- Node 17: {11, 5, 7, 0} -> 1 3-star
- Node 18: {7, 14, 10} -> 1 3-star
- Node 19: {0, 2, 13} -> 1 3-star

There are a total of 12 unique 3-stars formed. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [12]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (17, 19, 2)>
<1, (15, 6, 4)>
<2, (0, 19, 14)>
<4, (16, 5, 1)>
<5, (9, 4, 17)>
<6, (11, 1, 10)>
<7, (12, 15, 18, 17)>
<12, (9, 7, 10, 15)>
<14, (8, 18, 2)>
<15, (1, 7, 12, 8)>
<17, (11, 5, 7, 0)>
<18, (7, 14, 10)>
