Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 6, 8, 9, 3, 7
- Node 1 neighbors: 5, 8, 2
- Node 2 neighbors: 9, 4, 7, 1
- Node 3 neighbors: 5, 4, 0, 7
- Node 4 neighbors: 8, 3, 2
- Node 5 neighbors: 6, 1, 3, 7
- Node 6 neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 0
- Node 7 neighbors: 5, 6, 0, 3, 2
- Node 8 neighbors: 9, 4, 0, 1
- Node 9 neighbors: 6, 8, 2, 0

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (5, 6, 0)>
