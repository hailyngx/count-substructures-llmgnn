Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (25, 5) (25, 21) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (7, 2) (12, 24) (12, 19) (19, 12) (19, 24) (26, 23) (26, 5) (26, 11) (5, 25) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 21) (13, 23) (13, 9) (28, 0) (28, 14) (28, 18) (28, 15) (9, 13) (9, 24) (9, 1) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 0) (27, 29) (27, 11) (27, 2) (18, 28) (18, 21) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 8) (17, 23) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 21) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 15) (16, 29) (16, 17) (16, 1) (20, 8) (20, 21) (24, 12) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 8) (15, 28) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 4) (21, 25) (21, 5) (21, 18) (21, 8) (21, 20) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 28) (14, 1) (11, 26) (11, 27) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 27) (2, 10) (4, 15) (4, 10) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 5
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 5
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 2
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 3

From the degrees, we can see that nodes 8, 15, 21, 23, and 28 have 5 neighbors each. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].
