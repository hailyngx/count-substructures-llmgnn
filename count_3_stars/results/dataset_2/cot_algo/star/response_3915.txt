Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 4) (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 19) (22, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 25) (17, 23) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 8) (21, 20) (21, 12) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (2, 23) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (0, 12) (4, 26) (4, 18) (4, 23) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 19) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (27, 7) (27, 10) (27, 16) (27, 5) (25, 14) (25, 7) (25, 12) (25, 10) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 24) (19, 23) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 15) (24, 19) (24, 29) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 8) (28, 9) (28, 5) (5, 1) (5, 18) (5, 27) (5, 28) (5, 8) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 5) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 23) (23, 17) (23, 2) (23, 4) (23, 19) (23, 6) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 25) (10, 22) (10, 27) (10, 25) (29, 13) (29, 24) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {12}
- Node 1: {26, 13, 14, 5}
- Node 2: {23}
- Node 3: {11, 20, 16, 19}
- Node 4: {26, 18, 23}
- Node 5: {1, 18, 27, 28, 8}
- Node 6: {14, 11, 23}
- Node 7: {25, 11, 27, 8}
- Node 8: {15, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {26, 28}
- Node 10: {22, 27, 25}
- Node 11: {7, 3, 6}
- Node 12: {21, 0, 25}
- Node 13: {29, 1, 19}
- Node 14: {6, 1, 25}
- Node 15: {26, 16, 8}
- Node 16: {3, 27, 15}
- Node 17: {23}
- Node 18: {4, 19, 5}
- Node 19: {13, 18, 3, 24, 23}
- Node 20: {26, 21, 3}
- Node 21: {20, 12}
- Node 22: {10}
- Node 23: {17, 2, 4, 19, 6}
- Node 24: {19, 29}
- Node 25: {14, 7, 12, 10}
- Node 26: {9, 1, 15, 20, 4}
- Node 27: {7, 10, 16, 5}
- Node 28: {9, 5}
- Node 29: {13, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 13, and 5: <1, (26, 13, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 11, and 16: <3, (19, 11, 16)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 18, and 27: <5, (1, 18, 27)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 27, and 8: <7, (11, 27, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 15, and 7: <8, (5, 15, 7)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 27, 25, and 22: <10, (27, 25, 22)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 3: <11, (7, 6, 3)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 21, and 0: <12, (25, 21, 0)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 19, and 29: <13, (1, 19, 29)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 25: <14, (1, 6, 25)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 16, and 8: <15, (26, 16, 8)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 27, and 15: <16, (3, 27, 15)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 3, and 24: <19, (13, 3, 24)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 2, and 4: <23, (17, 2, 4)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 7, and 12: <25, (14, 7, 12)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 20, and 4: <26, (15, 20, 4)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 5, and 10: <27, (16, 5, 10)>

Counting up these unique 3-stars, the total number is [16].
