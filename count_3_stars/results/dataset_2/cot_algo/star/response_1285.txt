Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (12, 6) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 9, 7, 10, 13
Node 1: 4, 7, 10, 5, 8
Node 2: 6, 9, 7, 14, 13
Node 3: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
Node 4: 14, 1
Node 5: 10, 8, 1, 14
Node 6: 2, 12
Node 7: 0, 2, 1, 8
Node 8: 9, 7, 11, 5, 14, 1
Node 9: 8, 2, 3, 0
Node 10: 11, 0, 3, 1, 5
Node 11: 10, 3, 13, 8
Node 12: 6, 3
Node 13: 11, 3, 0, 2
Node 14: 4, 5, 8, 2

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:

Node 8 and Node 14 have 6 neighbors each, so they can form 6 3-stars each.
Node 1 and Node 5 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form 10 3-stars each.
Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, and Node 13 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form 4 3-stars each.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 6 + 6 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 64

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:
