Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 27) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 10) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 20) (21, 5) (1, 8) (22, 2) (22, 10) (23, 14) (23, 8) (23, 9) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 16) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 26) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 27) (9, 23) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 19) (25, 14) (25, 18) (25, 2) (27, 17) (27, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 5) (2, 14) (2, 22) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 21) (5, 16) (5, 26) (5, 4) (26, 29) (26, 5) (26, 12) (10, 7) (10, 22) (10, 24) (12, 26) (12, 24) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 4) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 16) (0, 11) (0, 24) (0, 18) (0, 13) (24, 15) (24, 10) (24, 12) (24, 0) (24, 4) (4, 5) (4, 20) (4, 24) (18, 25) (18, 20) (18, 0) (19, 28) (19, 9) (13, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].
