Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 16) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 21) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 2) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 20) (13, 0) (13, 16) (28, 26) (28, 24) (28, 5) (16, 27) (16, 13) (16, 21) (21, 0) (21, 16) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 24) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 7) (22, 3) (22, 11) (22, 5) (19, 29) (19, 18) (19, 20) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 20) (7, 8) (7, 2) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 25) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 19) (20, 12) (20, 6) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 25) (9, 11) (6, 20) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 22) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 13, 21}
- Node 1: {4, 10, 12, 14, 17}
- Node 2: {7, 11, 20}
- Node 3: {8, 11, 22, 23, 24}
- Node 4: {1, 8, 12, 23, 27}
- Node 5: {0, 22, 28}
- Node 6: {20}
- Node 7: {2, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 9: {11}
- Node 10: {1}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 9, 18, 22}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 17, 20}
- Node 13: {0, 16}
- Node 14: {1}
- Node 15: {12, 27}
- Node 16: {13, 21, 27}
- Node 17: {1, 12, 29}
- Node 18: {11, 19, 26}
- Node 19: {18, 20, 29}
- Node 20: {6, 12, 19, 26}
- Node 21: {0, 16}
- Node 22: {3, 5, 11}
- Node 23: {3, 4, 25}
- Node 24: {3, 25, 28}
- Node 25: {4, 23, 24, 27}
- Node 26: {18, 20, 28}
- Node 27: {4, 15, 16, 25}
- Node 28: {5, 24, 26}
- Node 29: {17, 19}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 39

The unique 3-stars found are:
