Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
Node 1: {3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 2: {3, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9}
Node 4: {0, 6, 8}
Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
Node 6: {2, 4, 5, 9}
Node 7: {0, 1, 2}
Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 4}
Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 6}

Now let's find the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 9, 3)
Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 5, 9)

Total number of 3-stars = 2, so [2].

Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 9, 3)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>
