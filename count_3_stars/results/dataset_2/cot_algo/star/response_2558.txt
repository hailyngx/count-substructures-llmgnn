This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 24) (15, 28) (6, 15) (6, 20) (9, 25) (9, 11) (9, 16) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 2) (23, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 4) (10, 23) (10, 1) (17, 2) (2, 23) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 26) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 20) (19, 0) (26, 8) (26, 2) (26, 19) (11, 9) (11, 28) (11, 24) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 7) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 18) (0, 1) (7, 22) (7, 28) (20, 6) (20, 19) (4, 3) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 14) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 12) (24, 15) (24, 11) (24, 25) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 29) (1, 5) (29, 1) (29, 27) (21, 22) (21, 18) (5, 22) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 25) (25, 9) (25, 24) (25, 5) (25, 18) (27, 29) (14, 19) (14, 12) (18, 0) (18, 21) (18, 25) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

- Node 0: {1, 15, 18, 19}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 10, 29}
- Node 2: {8, 17, 23, 26}
- Node 3: {4, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 12, 13, 22}
- Node 5: {1, 8, 12, 22, 25}
- Node 6: {15, 20}
- Node 7: {22, 28}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 13, 26}
- Node 9: {11, 16, 25}
- Node 10: {1, 23}
- Node 11: {9, 24, 28}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 14, 16}
- Node 13: {4, 8, 16}
- Node 14: {12, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 3, 6, 24, 28}
- Node 16: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 17: {2}
- Node 18: {0, 21, 25}
- Node 19: {0, 14, 20, 26}
- Node 20: {6, 19}
- Node 21: {18, 22}
- Node 22: {4, 5, 7, 21}
- Node 23: {2, 10}
- Node 24: {11, 15, 25}
- Node 25: {5, 9, 18, 24}
- Node 26: {2, 8, 19}
- Node 27: {29}
- Node 28: {7, 11, 15}
- Node 29: {1, 27}

Based on the neighbor sets, the nodes that can form a 3-star are:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 5
- Node 8
- Node 12
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 19
- Node 22
- Node 25

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 19, and 22, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
- For node 25, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 9 \times 4 + 1 \times 4 = 40 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (1, 18, 19)>
- <1, (0, 5, 10)>
- <5, (1, 12, 22)>
- <8, (2, 13, 26)>
- <12, (4, 5, 16)>
- <15, (3, 6, 24)>
- <16, (9, 12, 13)>
- <19, (0, 14, 20)>
- <22, (4, 7, 21)>
- <25, (5, 18, 24)>
