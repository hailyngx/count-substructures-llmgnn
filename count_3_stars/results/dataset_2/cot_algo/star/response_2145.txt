Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in this network can be found by analyzing the neighbor sets of each node and calculating the number of 3-stars that can be formed. 

Let's first find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 5, 6, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 11}
- Node 8: {6, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 6}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 8: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: No 3-stars can be formed (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 = 14\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this network is [14].
