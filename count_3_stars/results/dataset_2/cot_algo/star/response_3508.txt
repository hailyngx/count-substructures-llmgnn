Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (4, 8) (4, 18) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 2) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 3) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (11, 14) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 9) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 12) (16, 19) (16, 10) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 19) (12, 9) (12, 17) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {18, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 14, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {15, 7, 8, 1}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {15, 10, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {8, 18}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {3, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {7, 17}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {6, 18, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {15, 4, 2, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {8, 18, 19, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {3, 13, 1, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {14}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {13, 5, 19, 9, 17}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {12, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {0, 11, 1}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {3, 8, 2}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {19, 10}
- Node 17: Neighbors = {6, 19, 12}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9, 0}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {17, 16, 12, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 5: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 6: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{1}{3} = 0
- Node 12: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 14: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 16: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 17: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 19: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 2, 14>, <2, 7, 8>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 10, 16>, <2, 12, 19>, <7, 12, 17>, <8, 9, 12>, <9, 12, 17>, <9, 12, 19>, <18, 9, 19>, <10, 13, 16>, and <12, 17, 19>.
