Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 22) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 15) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 0) (23, 3) (23, 0) (23, 20) (2, 8) (2, 10) (19, 29) (19, 17) (19, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 27) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 20) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 13) (13, 26) (13, 18) (13, 25) (13, 3) (13, 6) (22, 16) (22, 4) (22, 14) (6, 13) (6, 24) (6, 20) (24, 4) (24, 6) (24, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 12) (3, 23) (3, 13) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (14, 22) (29, 8) (29, 19) (29, 5) (25, 13) (25, 12) (27, 26) (27, 18) (27, 1) (0, 8) (0, 23) (0, 17) (1, 27) (1, 9) (1, 12) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 1) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 15) (12, 11) (12, 21) (12, 10) (12, 25) (12, 1) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 28) (15, 21) (15, 28) (20, 23) (20, 4) (20, 18) (20, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 23, 17}
- Node 1: {27, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {8, 10}
- Node 3: {23, 13}
- Node 4: {18, 22, 24, 20}
- Node 5: {17, 29, 28}
- Node 6: {13, 24, 20}
- Node 7: {21, 10, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 29, 0}
- Node 9: {7, 24, 1}
- Node 10: {7, 2, 26, 12}
- Node 11: {16, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 21, 10, 25, 1}
- Node 13: {26, 18, 25, 3, 6}
- Node 14: {22}
- Node 15: {21, 28}
- Node 16: {11, 22}
- Node 17: {19, 0, 5}
- Node 18: {4, 27, 20, 13}
- Node 19: {29, 17, 28}
- Node 20: {23, 4, 18, 6}
- Node 21: {7, 12, 15}
- Node 22: {16, 4, 14}
- Node 23: {3, 0, 20}
- Node 24: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 25: {13, 12}
- Node 26: {13, 10, 27}
- Node 27: {26, 18, 1}
- Node 28: {19, 5, 15}
- Node 29: {8, 19, 5}

From the given neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, and 29 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these central nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 44
Therefore, the final answer is [44].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 23, 17)>
<1, (27, 9, 12)>
<4, (18, 22, 24), (18, 27, 13), (4, 22, 14), (20, 23, 0)>
<5, (17, 29, 28)>
<6, (13, 24, 20)>
<7, (21, 10, 9)>
<9, (7, 24, 1)>

<18, (27, 4, 20), (18, 13, 25), (4, 20, 6), (18, 20, 3)>

<26, (13, 10, 27)>
<27, (18, 1, 9)>
<29, (8, 19, 5)>
