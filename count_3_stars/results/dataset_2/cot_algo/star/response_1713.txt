Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 3, 4, 7, 9
Node 1: 3, 5
Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 8
Node 4: 0, 2, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6
Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 9
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's determine which nodes can form 3-star graphs:

Node 2, 4, and 9 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
Node 0 and 7 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.

The total number of unique 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38 \), so the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>
