Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first calculate the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 12}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 12}

After finding the neighbors, we identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of unique 3-stars: 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 11)>
- <0, (5, 7, 11)>
- <0, (6, 7, 11)>
- <4, (3, 10, 12)>
- <4, (3, 11, 12)>
- <4, (10, 11, 12)>
- <4, (10, 11, 13)>
- <8, (3, 5, 12)>
- <8, (3, 8, 12)>
- <8, (5, 12, 14)>
- <8, (8, 12, 14)>
- <8, (5, 8, 14)>
- <12, (3, 11, 13)>
- <12, (7, 11, 13)>
- <12, (10, 11, 13)>
- <12, (11, 12, 13)>
- <12, (4, 11, 13)>
- <12, (4, 12, 13)>
- <12, (4, 10, 12)>
- <12, (10, 12, 14)>
- <12, (11, 12, 14)>
- <12, (4, 12, 14)>
