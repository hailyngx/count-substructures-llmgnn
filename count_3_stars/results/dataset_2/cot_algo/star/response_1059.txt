Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {7, 12, 3}
Node 1: {12, 4, 2, 14, 10}
Node 2: {12, 13, 11, 4, 1}
Node 3: {5, 9, 11, 0, 10, 8}
Node 4: {12, 13, 11, 1, 2}
Node 5: {13, 8, 3, 14}
Node 6: {13, 11, 8, 14}
Node 7: {12, 0, 10}
Node 8: {5, 3, 6}
Node 9: {13, 3}
Node 10: {7, 3, 1}
Node 11: {3, 4, 6, 13, 2}
Node 12: {7, 4, 1, 0, 2}
Node 13: {5, 9, 3, 4, 2, 6}
Node 14: {5, 6, 1}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 1: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 2: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 3: C(6, 3) = 20
- Node 4: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 5: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 6: C(4, 3) = 4
- Node 7: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1
- Node 11: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 12: C(5, 3) = 10
- Node 13: C(6, 3) = 20
- Node 14: C(3, 3) = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 92

Therefore, the answer is [92].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (7, 12, 3)>
<1, (12, 4, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 11)>
<4, (12, 13, 11)>
<5, (13, 8, 3)>
<6, (13, 11, 8)>
<7, (12, 0, 10)>
<8, (5, 3, 6)>
<11, (3, 4, 6)>
<12, (7, 4, 1)>
<13, (5, 9, 3)>
<14, (5, 6, 1)>
