Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 17) (9, 0) (9, 19) (9, 1) (9, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (14, 5) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {11, 19, 3}
- Node 3: {11, 16, 2}
- Node 4: {8, 1}
- Node 5: {7, 1, 14}
- Node 6: {16, 0, 19, 18}
- Node 7: {10, 0, 5}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 12}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 18, 19}
- Node 10: {13, 17, 7, 18}
- Node 11: {16, 2, 3}
- Node 12: {8, 19}
- Node 13: {8, 10, 17, 15}
- Node 14: {5, 1}
- Node 15: {13, 17}
- Node 16: {11, 3, 6}
- Node 17: {13, 15}
- Node 18: {10, 9, 6}
- Node 19: {2, 9, 12, 6}

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars by calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3C3 = 1
- Node 1: 4C3 = 4
- Node 2: 3C3 = 1
- Node 3: 3C3 = 1
- Node 6: 4C3 = 4
- Node 9: 4C3 = 4
- Node 10: 4C3 = 4
- Node 13: 4C3 = 4
- Node 15: 2C3 = 0
- Node 16: 3C3 = 1
- Node 17: 2C3 = 0
- Node 18: 3C3 = 1
- Node 19: 4C3 = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 23

Therefore, the final answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9, 19)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 14)>, <1, (5, 9, 14)>, <1, (1, 5, 14)>, <2, (11, 16, 3)>, <3, (11, 16, 2)>, <6, (16, 0, 19)>, <6, (0, 6, 19)>, <6, (0, 18, 19)>, <6, (6, 18, 19)>, <9, (1, 9, 18)>, <9, (1, 18, 19)>, <9, (9, 18, 19)>, <10, (13, 17, 15)>, <10, (7, 10, 18)>, <13, (8, 10, 13)>, <13, (8, 13, 17)>, <13, (10, 13, 17)>, <13, (13, 17, 15)>, <16, (11, 3, 16)>, <18, (9, 10, 18)>, <19, (2, 9, 19)>, <19, (6, 9, 19)>
