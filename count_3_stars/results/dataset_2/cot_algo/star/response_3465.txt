Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 14) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 12) (15, 10) (15, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (13, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 14) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (11, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: neighbors {9, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 10}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 16, 14}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 1, 2, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {3, 6, 12}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {10, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors {5, 15, 8, 14, 6}
- Node 8: neighbors {14, 16, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {11, 17, 0}
- Node 10: neighbors {1, 18, 15, 6}
- Node 11: neighbors {9}
- Node 12: neighbors {18, 19, 4, 14}
- Node 13: neighbors {14}
- Node 14: neighbors {2, 13, 12, 8, 7}
- Node 15: neighbors {10, 7}
- Node 16: neighbors {2, 18, 19, 8}
- Node 17: neighbors {9, 19}
- Node 18: neighbors {10, 16, 12}
- Node 19: neighbors {17, 16, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 16, 14}
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 6, 12}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {10, 4, 7}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {5, 14, 15}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {14, 16, 7}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {11, 17, 0}
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {15, 18, 6}
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {18, 19, 14}
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {7, 16, 8}
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {18, 19, 8}
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {10, 16, 12}
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {17, 16, 12}

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 13 3-stars in total. So, the final answer is [13].
