Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 14}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 11}
- Node 7: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {5, 6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 14: {3, 4, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 13: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <0, (1, 2, 8)>
- <0, (1, 2, 13)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 13)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (2, 5, 13)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 10)>
- <1, (3, 5, 12)>
- <1, (9, 10, 12)>
- <3, (5, 11, 12)>
- <8, (4, 13, 14)>
- <11, (6, 7, 13)>
- <13, (4, 9, 13)>
