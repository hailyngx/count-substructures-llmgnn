Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (0, 3) (0, 15) (2, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 5) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 7) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (16, 19) (16, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 15) (3, 0) (3, 18) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 6) (5, 17) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 3, 15
Node 1: 6, 11, 12, 17
Node 2: 12
Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 8, 18
Node 4: 9, 14
Node 5: 3, 17
Node 6: 1, 8, 15, 16
Node 7: 3, 9, 11, 13
Node 8: 3, 6, 14, 19
Node 9: 4, 7, 17
Node 10: 11, 12
Node 11: 1, 7, 10, 19
Node 12: 1, 2, 10, 18
Node 13: 7, 15, 18
Node 14: 4, 8
Node 15: 0, 6, 13
Node 16: 6, 19
Node 17: 1, 5, 9
Node 18: 3, 12, 13
Node 19: 8, 11, 16

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

Node 1: 4 neighbors (3-star combinations: 4)
Node 3: 5 neighbors (3-star combinations: 10)
Node 7: 4 neighbors (3-star combinations: 4)
Node 8: 4 neighbors (3-star combinations: 4)
Node 11: 4 neighbors (3-star combinations: 4)
Node 12: 4 neighbors (3-star combinations: 4)
Node 13: 3 neighbors (3-star combinations: 1)
Node 15: 3 neighbors (3-star combinations: 1)
Node 17: 3 neighbors (3-star combinations: 1)
Node 18: 3 neighbors (3-star combinations: 1)
Node 19: 3 neighbors (3-star combinations: 1)

Summing up the 3-star combinations, we get the total number of 3-stars: 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 6, 12>
<3, 8, 18>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 8, 18>
<3, 7, 9>
<7, 8, 11>
<7, 9, 17>
<8, 11, 19>
<12, 10, 11>
<13, 15, 18>
<15, 6, 13>
<17, 5, 9>
<18, 3, 13>
<3, 0, 5>
<3, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 15>
<4, 9, 17>
<8, 14, 4>
<9, 17, 5>
<13, 18, 12>
<15, 13, 7>
<16, 19, 8>
<16, 6, 15>
