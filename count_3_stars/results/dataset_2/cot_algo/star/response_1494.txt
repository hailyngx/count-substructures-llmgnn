Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 11) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 6) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 2) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 7) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 26) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 22) (12, 7) (12, 5) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 21) (18, 17) (26, 20) (28, 25) (28, 13) (10, 3) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 29) (15, 17) (11, 25) (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 21) (16, 19) (19, 22) (19, 16) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 17) (1, 13) (29, 4) (29, 15) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 24) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 24) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 6) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 21) (24, 5) (24, 9) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 17) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {7, 14, 20}
Node 1: {13}
Node 2: {6, 10, 15, 23}
Node 3: {4, 7, 8, 10, 25}
Node 4: {3, 18, 29}
Node 5: {11, 12, 23, 24}
Node 6: {2, 13}
Node 7: {0, 3, 8, 12}
Node 8: {3, 7, 13, 20}
Node 9: {15, 17, 24}
Node 10: {2, 3, 15}
Node 11: {5, 21, 23, 25}
Node 12: {5, 7, 22}
Node 13: {1, 6, 8, 28}
Node 14: {0}
Node 15: {2, 9, 10, 17, 29}
Node 16: {19}
Node 17: {9, 15, 18, 21, 27}
Node 18: {4, 17, 21, 27}
Node 19: {16, 22}
Node 20: {0, 8, 26}
Node 21: {11, 17, 18}
Node 22: {12, 19, 23}
Node 23: {2, 5, 11, 22}
Node 24: {5, 9}
Node 25: {3, 11, 25, 27, 28}
Node 26: {20}
Node 27: {17, 18, 25}
Node 28: {13, 25}
Node 29: {4, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 22, 23, 25

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3}  + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3}  + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 96 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [96].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, 7, 14>
<0, 7, 20>
<0, 14, 20>
<2, 6, 13>
<2, 6, 15>
<2, 6, 23>
<2, 10, 15>
<2, 10, 23>
<2, 15, 29>
<3, 4, 8>
<3, 4, 10>
<3, 4, 25>
<3, 4, 29>
<3, 7, 8>
<3, 7, 10>
<3, 7, 25>
<3, 8, 10>
<3, 8, 25>
<5, 11, 23>
<5, 11, 24>
<5, 12, 23>
<5, 12, 24>
<5, 23, 24>
<7, 8, 12>
<7, 8, 13>
<7, 12, 22>
<8, 13, 28>
<9, 15, 17>
<9, 15, 24>
<9, 17, 24>
<11, 21, 25>
<17, 18, 21>
<17, 18, 27>
<17, 21, 27>
