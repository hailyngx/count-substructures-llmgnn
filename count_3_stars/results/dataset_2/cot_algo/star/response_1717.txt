Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 2, Node 6

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
