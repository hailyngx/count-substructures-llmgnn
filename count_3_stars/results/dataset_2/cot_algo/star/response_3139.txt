Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3}= 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3}= 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 4, 7, 8>
- <2, 1, 5, 6>
- <2, 1, 5, 7>
- <2, 1, 6, 7>
- <2, 4, 5, 6>
- <2, 4, 5, 7>
- <5, 1, 6, 7>
- <5, 2, 6, 7>
- <5, 7, 6, 9>
- <6, 1, 2, 5>
- <6, 1, 2, 7>
- <6, 2, 5, 7>
- <6, 7, 5, 9>
- <8, 0, 4, 3>
- <8, 0, 4, 5>
- <8, 0, 6, 7>
- <8, 3, 4, 0>
- <9, 0, 4, 5>
- <9, 0, 6, 7>
- <9, 5, 4, 0>
