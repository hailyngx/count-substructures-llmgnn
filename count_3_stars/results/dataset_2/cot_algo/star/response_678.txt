Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 11, 12}
Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 5, 11}
Node 2: {1, 12}
Node 3: {4, 5, 10, 12, 13}
Node 4: {1, 3, 6}
Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
Node 6: {4, 7, 9, 10, 11}
Node 7: {0, 6, 8, 10, 13}
Node 8: {5, 7, 13}
Node 9: {5, 6, 12, 14}
Node 10: {3, 6, 7, 13, 14}
Node 11: {0, 1, 6}
Node 12: {0, 2, 3, 9}
Node 13: {3, 7, 8, 10}
Node 14: {9, 10}

Nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, and 10 have 5 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final total number of 3-stars is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 11, 12)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 12)>
<0, (1, 11, 5)>
<0, (1, 11, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 11)>
<3, (4, 12, 13)>
<3, (4, 5, 13)>
<3, (5, 10, 12)>
<3, (5, 10, 13)>
<5, (8, 9, 14)>
<5, (9, 12, 14)>
<5, (9, 13, 14)>
<5, (9, 8, 14)>
<7, (10, 12, 14)>
