Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 7

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars with nodes 4, 5, and 7, and nodes 7, 9, and 6
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5, and we represent them as <1, 5, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 2, 7>, <6, 4, 7>. 
So, the final answer is [5].
