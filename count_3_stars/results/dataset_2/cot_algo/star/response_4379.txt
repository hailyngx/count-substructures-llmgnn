Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 8) (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 14) (16, 20) (14, 16) (14, 9) (17, 22) (17, 19) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 19) (21, 25) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 20) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 29) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 19) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 6) (20, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 0) (3, 21) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 28) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 10) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 10) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 0) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 28) (28, 15) (28, 25) (28, 8) (24, 5) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 0) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 5) (0, 18) (0, 26) (0, 5) (0, 1) (10, 12) (10, 29) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 18, 26}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 12, 29}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 22}
- Node 3: {7, 21}
- Node 4: {2, 29}
- Node 5: {0, 23, 24, 26}
- Node 6: {9, 18, 20, 23, 25}
- Node 7: {3, 21, 23, 25}
- Node 8: {20, 22, 28}
- Node 9: {6, 14, 22, 29}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 12, 29}
- Node 11: {16}
- Node 12: {1, 10, 19}
- Node 13: {22}
- Node 14: {9, 16}
- Node 15: {18, 20, 28}
- Node 16: {11, 14, 20}
- Node 17: {19, 22}
- Node 18: {6, 15, 19}
- Node 19: {12, 17, 18, 21, 26}
- Node 20: {6, 8, 15, 16}
- Node 21: {3, 7, 19, 25}
- Node 22: {2, 8, 13, 17, 22}
- Node 23: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 24: {5}
- Node 25: {7, 21, 25, 28}
- Node 26: {0, 5, 19}
- Node 28: {8, 15, 25, 28}
- Node 29: {1, 4, 9, 10}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:

- Node 9 and its neighbors {6, 14, 22, 29}: <9, (6, 14, 29)>, <9, (6, 22, 29)>
- Node 10 and its neighbors {1, 2, 12, 29}: <10, (1, 2, 29)>, <10, (1, 12, 29)>, <10, (2, 12, 29)>
- Node 19 and its neighbors {12, 17, 18, 21, 26}: <19, (12, 17, 19)>, <19, (12, 18, 19)>, <19, (12, 21, 19)>, <19, (12, 26, 19)>, <19, (17, 18, 19)>, <19, (17, 21, 19)>, <19, (17, 26, 19)>, <19, (18, 21, 19)>, <19, (18, 26, 19)>, <19, (21, 26, 19)>
- Node 20 and its neighbors {6, 8, 15, 16}: <20, (6, 8, 15)>, <20, (6, 8, 16)>, <20, (6, 15, 16)>, <20, (8, 15, 16)>
- Node 22 and its neighbors {2, 8, 13, 17, 22}: <22, (2, 8, 13)>, <22, (2, 8, 17)>, <22, (2, 8, 22)>, <22, (2, 13, 17)>, <22, (2, 13, 22)>, <22, (2, 17, 22)>, <22, (8, 13, 17)>, <22, (8, 13, 22)>, <22, (8, 17, 22)>, <22, (13, 17, 22)>
- Node 25 and its neighbors {7, 21, 28}: <25, (7, 21, 28)>
- Node 29 and its neighbors {1, 4, 9, 10}: <29, (1, 4, 9)>, <29, (1, 4, 10)>, <29, (1, 9, 10)>, <29, (4, 9, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars = 21, so the answer is [21].
