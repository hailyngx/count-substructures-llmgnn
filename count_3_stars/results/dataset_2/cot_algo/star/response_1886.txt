Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 26) (3, 22) (3, 18) (15, 5) (15, 29) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 21) (29, 15) (29, 2) (29, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (18, 3) (18, 12) (28, 16) (28, 17) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 7) (25, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 27) (16, 3) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 23) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 5) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 1) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 20) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 5) (19, 21) (19, 10) (11, 24) (11, 21) (24, 7) (24, 0) (24, 11) (1, 29) (1, 22) (1, 23) (17, 28) (17, 23) (20, 7) (20, 5) (20, 10) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 21) (4, 25) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 5) (10, 19) (10, 20) (10, 14) (27, 7) (27, 9) (23, 16) (23, 1) (23, 17) (21, 2) (21, 19) (21, 11) (21, 14) (21, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 16, 24}
- Node 1: {22, 23, 29}
- Node 2: {21, 22, 26, 29}
- Node 3: {16, 18, 22, 26}
- Node 4: {9, 14, 21, 25}
- Node 5: {0, 12, 15, 20, 26}
- Node 7: {20, 24, 25, 27}
- Node 8: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 8, 27}
- Node 10: {14, 19, 20}
- Node 11: {21, 24}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 13, 18}
- Node 13: {8, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 10, 21}
- Node 15: {5, 29}
- Node 16: {0, 3, 23, 28}
- Node 17: {23, 28}
- Node 18: {3, 12}
- Node 19: {10, 21}
- Node 20: {5, 7, 10}
- Node 21: {2, 11, 14, 19}
- Node 22: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 23: {1, 16, 17}
- Node 24: {0, 7, 11}
- Node 25: {4, 7}
- Node 26: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 27: {7, 9}
- Node 28: {16, 17}
- Node 29: {1, 2, 15}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of 54. Therefore, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 16, 24)>, <0, (5, 9, 24)>, <0, (9, 16, 24)>, <2, (21, 26, 29)>, <3, (16, 22, 26)>, <5, (12, 15, 20)>, <7, (20, 24, 27)>, <9, (8, 12, 13)>, <12, (5, 13, 18)>, <16, (0, 23, 28)>, <21, (11, 14, 24)>.
