Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 17) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 13) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 9) (4, 13) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (11, 14) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 12, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 6, 8, 15}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 7, 15, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbor {13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 8, 12, 16, 18}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 17}
- Node 8: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 19}
- Node 9: Neighbors {18, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {13, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbor {14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 5, 14, 17}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 10, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 11, 12}
- Node 15: Neighbors {2, 3, 17}
- Node 16: Neighbors {5, 10, 18}
- Node 17: Neighbors {7, 12, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {3, 5, 9, 13, 16}
- Node 19: Neighbors {8, 9}

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 8, Node 18

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33], and the unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 12, 14)>, <2, (0, 6, 8, 15)>, <3, (1, 7, 15, 18)>, <5, (1, 8, 12, 16, 18)>, <8, (2, 5, 6, 19)>, <18, (3, 5, 9, 13, 16)>
