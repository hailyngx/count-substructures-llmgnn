Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 17) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (17, 8) (17, 19) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (11, 18) (11, 2) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 11) (2, 15) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 16) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 14) (19, 16) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 9, 10, 14, 16}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 9, 15}
- Node 2: {11, 15}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {12, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 16, 18}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 7: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {7, 13, 17}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 15}
- Node 10: {0, 12}
- Node 11: {2, 18}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 10, 19}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 16, 19}
- Node 15: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 16: {0, 5, 14, 19}
- Node 17: {8, 19}
- Node 18: {5, 11}
- Node 19: {12, 14, 16, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30 \)

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, (6, 14, 16)>
- <1, (3, 9, 15)>
- <12, (4, 7, 19)>
- <14, (0, 16, 19)>
- <16, (0, 14, 19)>
- <19, (12, 14, 16)>
