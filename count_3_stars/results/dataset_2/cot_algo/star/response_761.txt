Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The central idea in this problem is to determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
Let's first calculate the number of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 5 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 3: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 3 neighbors
Node 8: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 8 neighbors

Now, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)

Adding up these values, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 56 = 105.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [105].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 7>
<0, 3, 8>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 9>
<1, 8, 9>
<2, 6, 9>
<2, 8, 9>
<4, 0, 3>
<4, 3, 7>
<5, 0, 9>
<6, 1, 9>
