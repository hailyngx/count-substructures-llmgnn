Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 13, 14, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 8, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 6, 9, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {7, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 6, 9, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 6: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 14)>, <7, (2, 11, 13)>, <13, (0, 7, 14)>, <14, (1, 6, 9)>
