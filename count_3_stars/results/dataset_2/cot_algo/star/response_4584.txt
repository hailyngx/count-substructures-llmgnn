Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 24) (13, 0) (22, 0) (22, 3) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 27) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 22) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 26) (20, 5) (25, 19) (8, 4) (8, 18) (8, 27) (26, 3) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 17) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 16) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 16) (28, 0) (28, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 24) (12, 14) (5, 20) (5, 2) (19, 25) (19, 6) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 23) (16, 29) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 2) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 16) (21, 11) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 14) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 6) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 11) (6, 19) (6, 27) (6, 14) (6, 23) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (24, 13) (24, 12) (24, 10) (11, 21) (11, 0) (11, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 28) (23, 10) (23, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {13, 22, 28, 11}
- Node 1: {3, 14, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 16, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {22, 4, 1, 26}
- Node 4: {8, 3}
- Node 5: {20, 2}
- Node 6: {19, 27, 14, 23}
- Node 7: {12, 15, 27}
- Node 8: {4, 18, 27}
- Node 9: {2, 11}
- Node 10: {26, 24, 23}
- Node 11: {21, 0, 9}
- Node 12: {7, 17, 24, 14}
- Node 13: {21, 24, 0}
- Node 14: {1, 12, 2, 6}
- Node 15: {7, 18, 16}
- Node 16: {29, 15, 21, 2}
- Node 17: {26, 29, 12}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 15, 28}
- Node 19: {25, 6}
- Node 20: {5}
- Node 21: {13, 26, 16, 11}
- Node 22: {0, 3}
- Node 23: {10, 6}
- Node 24: {13, 12, 10}
- Node 25: {19}
- Node 26: {17, 3, 10, 21}
- Node 27: {7, 8, 6, 29}
- Node 28: {0, 18}
- Node 29: {17, 27, 16}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \).  
Put inside brackets, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <3, (1, 4, 26)>
- <6, (12, 19, 27)>
- <12, (14, 17, 24)>
- <16, (2, 15, 29)>
- <21, (11, 13, 26)>
- <27, (6, 8, 29)>
