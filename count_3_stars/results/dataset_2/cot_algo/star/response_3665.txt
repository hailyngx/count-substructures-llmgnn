Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {7, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 11}
- Node 6: {0, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {7, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {4, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 8, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14
Number of 3-stars for each node: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
Total number of 3-stars: \(8\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([8]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (7, 10, 14)>
- <5, (1, 10, 11)>
- <6, (0, 12, 7)>
- <8, (7, 12, 14)>
- <13, (4, 9, 11)>
- <14, (2, 8, 12)>
