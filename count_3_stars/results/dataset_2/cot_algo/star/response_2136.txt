Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (2, 8) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 9) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 12) (16, 19) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 0) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 13) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 14) (10, 6) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 5, 11, 15
- Node 1: 4, 13, 18
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 8, 9, 15, 19
- Node 4: 0, 1, 14
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5, 7, 10
- Node 7: 5, 6, 12, 19
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 3, 12, 13
- Node 10: 6, 14
- Node 11: 0, 13
- Node 12: 7, 9, 16, 17, 19
- Node 13: 1, 9, 11, 18
- Node 14: 4, 10
- Node 15: 0, 3
- Node 16: 12, 19
- Node 17: 12, 18
- Node 18: 1, 13, 17
- Node 19: 3, 7, 12, 16

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33], and the unique 3-stars found are: 

<3, (8, 15, 19)>
<7, (5, 12, 19)>
<12, (7, 16, 19)>
<13, (1, 9, 11)>
<18, (1, 13, 17)>
<19, (3, 7, 16)>
