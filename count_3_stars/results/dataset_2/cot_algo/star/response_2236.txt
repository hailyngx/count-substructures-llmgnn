Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 9, 8, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 9, 3}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 9, 0}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 2, 9, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 9, 3, 0}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 8, 1, 0, 2}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 5, 6. 
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 2, 4.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 7, 8.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, and <9, (0, 7, 8)>.
