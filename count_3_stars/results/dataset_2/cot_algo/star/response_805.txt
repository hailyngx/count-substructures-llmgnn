This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 23) (1, 23) (21, 0) (21, 12) (6, 5) (6, 26) (6, 27) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 10) (0, 21) (0, 26) (27, 6) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 5) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 27) (7, 4) (5, 6) (5, 27) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 20) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 28) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 10) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 29) (17, 4) (17, 29) (17, 12) (17, 22) (29, 18) (29, 17) (29, 19) (24, 27) (24, 26) (26, 6) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 20) (26, 25) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 25) (19, 29) (19, 15) (14, 22) (14, 12) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 14) (3, 4) (3, 2) (20, 5) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 28) (23, 16) (23, 1) (12, 21) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 25) (13, 20) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 28) (28, 4) (28, 2) (28, 20) (28, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: neighbors {21, 26}
- Node 1: neighbors {23}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 8, 9, 28}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 4: neighbors {3, 7, 17, 28}
- Node 5: neighbors {6, 15, 20, 22, 27}
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 26, 27}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 27}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 10, 11}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 10, 18}
- Node 10: neighbors {8, 9, 28}
- Node 11: neighbors {8, 16}
- Node 12: neighbors {14, 17, 21, 25}
- Node 13: neighbors {20}
- Node 14: neighbors {12, 22}
- Node 15: neighbors {5, 19, 25}
- Node 16: neighbors {11, 18, 23}
- Node 17: neighbors {4, 12, 22, 29}
- Node 18: neighbors {9, 16, 20, 29}
- Node 19: neighbors {15, 29}
- Node 20: neighbors {5, 13, 18, 26, 28}
- Node 21: neighbors {0, 12}
- Node 22: neighbors {5, 14, 17}
- Node 23: neighbors {1, 16}
- Node 24: neighbors {26, 27}
- Node 25: neighbors {12, 15, 26}
- Node 26: neighbors {0, 5, 24, 25}
- Node 27: neighbors {6, 7, 24, 5}
- Node 28: neighbors {2, 4, 10, 20}
- Node 29: neighbors {17, 18, 19}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 1 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 12 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 14 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 15 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 16 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 17 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 18 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 19 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 20 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 21 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 22 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 23 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 24 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 25 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 26 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 27 cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 28 can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 29 can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get 16. Therefore, the final answer is [16].
