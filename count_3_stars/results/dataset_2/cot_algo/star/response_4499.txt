Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 15) (18, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 19) (0, 17) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 16) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (16, 19) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 16) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
Given a graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, the 3-star analysis can be performed as follows:

1. Nodes with their neighbor sets:
   - Node 0: {17}
   - Node 1: {17, 7, 13, 19}
   - Node 2: {15, 11}
   - Node 3: {11, 9, 5, 12}
   - Node 4: {18, 6}
   - Node 5: {3, 7, 11, 8}
   - Node 6: {14, 4, 10}
   - Node 7: {12, 5, 1}
   - Node 8: {15, 5, 19}
   - Node 9: {3, 13, 16}
   - Node 10: {14, 6, 19, 16}
   - Node 11: {3, 5, 2}
   - Node 12: {3, 7, 13}
   - Node 13: {1, 12, 9}
   - Node 14: {6, 17, 10}
   - Node 15: {2, 8, 18}
   - Node 16: {9, 19, 10}
   - Node 17: {14, 1, 0}
   - Node 18: {4, 15}
   - Node 19: {1, 8, 10, 16}

2. Nodes that can form a 3-star:
   - Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
   - Node 3: <3, (11, 9, 5)>
   - Node 5: <5, (3, 7, 8)>
   - Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Node 10: <10, (14, 19, 16)>
   - Node 11: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Node 12: <12, (3, 7, 13)>
   - Node 13: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Node 14: <14, (6, 17, 10)>
   - Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Node 17: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
   - Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

3. Total number of unique 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [18]

4. Unique 3-stars found:
   - <3, (11, 9, 5)>
   - <5, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <10, (14, 19, 16)>
   - <12, (3, 7, 13)>
   - <14, (6, 17, 10)>
   - <1, (17, 7, 13)>
   - <19, (1, 8, 10)>
