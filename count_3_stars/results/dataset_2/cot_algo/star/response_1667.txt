Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 17) (23, 27) (12, 10) (12, 11) (27, 23) (27, 20) (27, 26) (27, 16) (15, 20) (15, 14) (15, 24) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 28) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 22) (9, 18) (5, 24) (5, 14) (13, 21) (13, 1) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 11) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 14) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 25) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 3) (18, 9) (1, 13) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 16) (29, 1) (29, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 1) (24, 15) (24, 5) (24, 0) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 25) (14, 19) (14, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (16, 4) (16, 27) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 10) (0, 29) (0, 24) (10, 22) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 16) (28, 20) 

Response:
To start, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors [24, 29]
- Node 1: Neighbors [11, 13, 16, 29]
- Node 3: Neighbors [8, 14, 19]
- Node 4: Neighbors [7, 9, 16]
- Node 5: Neighbors [14, 15, 24]
- Node 6: Neighbors [8, 10]
- Node 7: Neighbors [4, 9, 20, 21]
- Node 8: Neighbors [3, 6, 16]
- Node 9: Neighbors [4, 7, 18, 22]
- Node 10: Neighbors [6, 12, 16, 22]
- Node 11: Neighbors [1, 12, 17, 19]
- Node 12: Neighbors [10, 11]
- Node 13: Neighbors [1, 21]
- Node 14: Neighbors [3, 5, 19, 25]
- Node 15: Neighbors [5, 14, 20, 24]
- Node 16: Neighbors [1, 4, 8, 10, 27]
- Node 17: Neighbors [11, 20, 22, 25]
- Node 18: Neighbors [9]
- Node 19: Neighbors [3, 11, 14, 22]
- Node 20: Neighbors [7, 15, 17, 27, 28]
- Node 21: Neighbors [7, 13, 26]
- Node 22: Neighbors [9, 10, 17, 19]
- Node 23: Neighbors [27]
- Node 24: Neighbors [0, 5, 15]
- Node 25: Neighbors [14, 17, 26]
- Node 26: Neighbors [21, 25, 27]
- Node 27: Neighbors [16, 20, 21, 26]
- Node 28: Neighbors [20]
- Node 29: Neighbors [0, 1]

Now, we'll identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 4: <4, (7, 9, 16)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 9, 21)> 
- Node 9: <9, (4, 7, 22)> 
- Node 16: <16, (1, 4, 8)>

Now, sum up the total number of 3-stars: 4
Therefore, we have a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
