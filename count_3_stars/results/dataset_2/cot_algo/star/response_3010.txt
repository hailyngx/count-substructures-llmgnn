Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 1, 3, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 4, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 7, 8, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 8, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 2, 8}
- Node 7: {4}
- Node 8: {5, 4, 6, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 3}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 74 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [74].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 2)>, <8, (5, 4, 6)>
