Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 5: 0, 2, 6
- Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7, 8

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Finally, we sum up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
