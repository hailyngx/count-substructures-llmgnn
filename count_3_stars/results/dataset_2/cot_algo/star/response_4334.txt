Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 14) (27, 9) (14, 27) (14, 17) (14, 26) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (21, 5) (21, 22) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (11, 19) (11, 4) (24, 10) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 3) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 23) (16, 10) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 20) (2, 7) (2, 0) (22, 21) (22, 3) (22, 6) (22, 1) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 18) (9, 27) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 4) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 12) (8, 7) (8, 10) (1, 28) (1, 22) (1, 25) (20, 3) (20, 28) (4, 11) (4, 9) (25, 1) (25, 6) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 12) (12, 17) (12, 28) (12, 5) (12, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 24) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 6) (29, 16) (29, 18) (29, 0) (13, 18) (13, 23) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 29) 

Response:
Since this graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, each node will have a degree that is less than or equal to 29. 
We'll first identify the neighbor set for each node and then count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 6, 29}
- Node 1: {22, 25, 28}
- Node 2: {0, 7, 22}
- Node 3: {20, 22, 26}
- Node 4: {9, 11}
- Node 5: {12, 17, 18, 21}
- Node 6: {0, 10, 22, 25}
- Node 7: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {7, 10}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 18, 27}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 16, 24}
- Node 11: {4, 19}
- Node 12: {5, 12, 17, 23, 28}
- Node 13: {18, 23}
- Node 14: {26, 27}
- Node 15: {26, 27, 28}
- Node 16: {10, 16, 23, 28, 29}
- Node 17: {5, 12, 14}
- Node 18: {5, 9, 13, 18, 29}
- Node 19: {11, 18}
- Node 20: {3, 28}
- Node 21: {5, 22}
- Node 22: {1, 2, 3, 6, 21}
- Node 23: {12, 13, 16}
- Node 24: {10}
- Node 25: {1, 6}
- Node 26: {3, 14, 15}
- Node 27: {9, 14, 15}
- Node 28: {1, 12, 15, 16, 20}
- Node 29: {0, 16, 18}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
1. <5, (12, 17, 18)>
2. <12, (5, 17, 23)>
3. <16, (10, 23, 28)>
4. <18, (5, 9, 29)>
5. <26, (14, 15, 27)>
6. <28, (1, 12, 16)>
