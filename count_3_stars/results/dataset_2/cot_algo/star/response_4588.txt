Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: Since it has 5 neighbors (\(n\)), it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: Also has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3: Again, 5 neighbors, forming 10 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 10 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 2) + 10 (from Node 3) = 30.

So, there are 30 3-stars in this graph, and we list them as follows:
<[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 4], [0, 1, 6], [0, 1, 7], [0, 2, 3], [0, 2, 4], [0, 2, 6], [0, 2, 7], [0, 3, 4], [0, 3, 6], [0, 3, 7], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 8], [1, 8, 3], [2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 8], [2, 3, 9], [4, 3, 6], [4, 3, 8], [4, 3, 9], [0, 1, 7], [0, 1, 8], [0, 7, 4], [0, 8, 4], [1, 8, 4], [7, 8, 4], [0, 1, 7], [0, 1, 8], [0, 7, 4], [0, 8, 4]. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].
