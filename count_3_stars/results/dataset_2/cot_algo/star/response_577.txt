Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 29) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 14) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 22) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 20) (0, 5) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 2) (26, 24) (26, 2) (26, 25) (27, 4) (27, 25) (16, 1) (16, 25) (28, 22) (28, 2) (28, 23) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 14) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 13) (25, 29) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 28) (2, 24) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 9) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 24) (19, 15) (19, 9) (5, 0) (5, 20) (23, 28) (23, 29) (3, 20) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 23) (29, 14) (9, 21) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 11) (1, 24) (1, 16) (1, 18) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 21) (14, 29) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {7, 20, 5}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {24, 16, 18}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {24, 26, 28, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {20}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {27, 22, 29}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 20}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {2, 15, 18}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 29, 20, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {21, 12, 19, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {21, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {12, 9, 13}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {11, 15, 9}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {25, 15, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {7, 10, 21, 29}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {12, 19, 6, 13}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {1, 25}
- Node 17: Neighbors = {22, 18}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {17, 1, 6}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {24, 15, 9}
- Node 20: Neighbors = {0, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 21: Neighbors = {10, 9, 14}
- Node 22: Neighbors = {4, 17, 28}
- Node 23: Neighbors = {28, 29}
- Node 24: Neighbors = {26, 1, 19, 2}
- Node 25: Neighbors = {26, 27, 16, 13, 29}
- Node 26: Neighbors = {24, 2, 25}
- Node 27: Neighbors = {4, 25}
- Node 28: Neighbors = {22, 2, 23}
- Node 29: Neighbors = {4, 7, 25, 23, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 27, 22, 29
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 29, 14, 20
- Node 14: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 21, 29
- Node 25: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 27, 16, 29

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is 4, which can be represented as [4]. The unique 3-stars are:

<4, (27, 22, 29)>
<7, (29, 14, 20)>
<14, (4, 21, 29)>
<25, (27, 16, 29)>
