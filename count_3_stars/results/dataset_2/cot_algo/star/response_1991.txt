Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 3: neighbors {1, 8, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: neighbors {6, 8, 13}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 1, 8}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 7, 10}
- Node 10: neighbors {3, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 11: neighbors {0, 2, 12, 14}
- Node 12: neighbors {2, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 13: neighbors {3, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 14: neighbors {10, 11}

Now, let's identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for Node 0
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for Node 1
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 2
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for Node 3
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 6
- \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for Node 8
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 9
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 10
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 11
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 12
- \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for Node 13

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 64 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [64]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 11>
- <0, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <3, 8, 12>
- <3, 8, 13>
- <8, 12, 13>
- <10, 13, 14>
