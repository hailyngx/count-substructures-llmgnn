Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 3: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 42

So, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
