Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 3}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 10, 12, 11}
- Node 4: {8, 10}
- Node 5: {13, 2, 11, 1}
- Node 6: {9, 8, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 7: {12, 0, 3, 11}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 4, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 3, 12, 2}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 13, 3, 14}
- Node 12: {9, 7, 3, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 11}
- Node 14: {8, 12, 11, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars found:
<5, (13, 11, 1)>
<6, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<10, (4, 3, 2)>
<11, (5, 7, 13)>
<12, (9, 7, 3)>
<14, (8, 12, 11)>
