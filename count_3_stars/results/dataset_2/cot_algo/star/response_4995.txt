Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 2) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node:

- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 4
- Node 15 has degree 2
- Node 16 has degree 4
- Node 17 has degree 4
- Node 18 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 4

Now we will list out the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {14, 17, 3}
- Node 1: {11, 12}
- Node 2: {9, 16}
- Node 3: {0, 8}
- Node 4: {17, 12, 6}
- Node 5: {7, 12}
- Node 6: {4}
- Node 7: {11, 19, 9, 5}
- Node 8: {14, 3, 19}
- Node 9: {18, 16, 7, 2}
- Node 11: {7, 1, 19, 15}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 13, 5}
- Node 13: {15, 12, 18}
- Node 14: {0, 17, 8, 18}
- Node 15: {11, 13}
- Node 16: {8, 9, 18, 2}
- Node 17: {14, 0, 19, 4}
- Node 18: {14, 9, 16, 13}
- Node 19: {17, 11, 8, 7}

Now we can identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors that form 3-stars:
- Node 1 <1, (11, 12, 5)>
- Node 4 <4, (17, 12, 6)>
- Node 12 <12, (1, 4, 13)>
- Node 14 <14, (0, 17, 18)>
- Node 16 <16, (8, 9, 18)>
- Node 17 <17, (14, 19, 4)>
- Node 18 <18, (14, 9, 16)>
- Node 19 <19, (17, 11, 8)>
- Node 7 will have additional 4 3-stars
- Node 9 will have additional 4 3-stars
- Node 11 will have additional 4 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 30 3-stars. Thus, the final answer is [30].
