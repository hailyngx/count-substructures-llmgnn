Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 10, 12}
Node 1: {0, 3, 7, 10}
Node 2: {0, 3, 4, 13}
Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 13, 14}
Node 4: {2, 6, 8}
Node 5: {3, 6, 7, 12}
Node 6: {4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 14}
Node 7: {1, 5, 9}
Node 8: {4, 6, 13}
Node 9: {6, 7, 10}
Node 10: {0, 1, 9, 11, 12}
Node 11: {6, 10, 12}
Node 12: {0, 5, 10, 11, 14}
Node 13: {2, 3, 8, 14}
Node 14: {3, 6, 12, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star:

Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 7, 10)>
Node 3 forms three 3-stars: <3, (2, 13, 14)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 12, 14)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 12)>
Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (4, 8, 13)>, <6, (5, 9, 11)>
Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (5, 11, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
