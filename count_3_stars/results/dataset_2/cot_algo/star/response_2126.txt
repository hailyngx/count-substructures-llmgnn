Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 10) (5, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (15, 19) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 14) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8, 13
- Node 1: 0, 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 7, 12, 14
- Node 3: 5, 8, 12, 18
- Node 4: 0, 8
- Node 5: 3, 10
- Node 6: 0, 18
- Node 7: 2, 7, 12, 16
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 14
- Node 9: 1, 14
- Node 10: 5, 17
- Node 11: 16, 17, 18
- Node 12: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 13: 0, 17
- Node 14: 2, 8, 9
- Node 15: 19
- Node 16: 7, 11, 19
- Node 17: 10, 13, 17
- Node 18: 3, 6, 11, 18
- Node 19: 15, 16, 18

There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so we will check for 3-star formations:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 13)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 13)>
- <0, (4, 8, 13)>
- <0, (6, 8, 13)>
- <2, (1, 7, 14)>
- <2, (7, 12, 14)>
- <7, (12, 14, 9)>
- <8, (3, 4, 14)>
- <8, (3, 8, 14)>
- <8, (4, 8, 14)>
- <12, (2, 3, 14)>
- <12, (2, 3, 9)>
- <12, (2, 7, 9)>
- <12, (3, 7, 9)>
- <12, (4, 9, 14)>
- <12, (7, 9, 14)>
