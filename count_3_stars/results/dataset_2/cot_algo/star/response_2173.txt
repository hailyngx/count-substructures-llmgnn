Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {8, 3}
Node 1: {5, 6, 7, 2}
Node 2: {6, 8, 1, 3}
Node 3: {5, 9, 6, 4, 2, 0}
Node 4: {7, 8, 3}
Node 5: {1, 3, 7}
Node 6: {9, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8}
Node 7: {5, 9, 6, 4, 1}
Node 8: {6, 4, 2, 0}
Node 9: {6, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each such node:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get:

\( 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<2, (6, 8, 1)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 6)>
