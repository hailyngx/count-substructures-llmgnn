Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are formed as follows:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {1, 4, 9}. 
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<0, (1, 4, 9)>

Node 1 has 6 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}. 
Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
<1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {3, 5, 6, 8}. 
No 3-star is formed with node 2.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 5, 8}. 
No 3-star is formed with node 4.

Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 7, 8}. 
<5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. 
<8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
