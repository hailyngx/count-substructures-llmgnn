Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 0) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 11) (2, 29) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 27) (29, 0) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 8) (5, 21) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 11) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 13) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 2) (28, 16) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 23) (8, 12) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 15) (25, 27) (25, 15) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 25) (4, 22) (4, 0) (4, 15) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 1) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 1) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 17) (3, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (18, 23) (18, 0) (23, 20) (23, 17) (23, 18) (23, 21) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (10, 1) (10, 3) (13, 7) (13, 24) (21, 5) (21, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 17, 18, 29}
- Node 1: {11, 14, 10}
- Node 2: {29, 3, 14, 28}
- Node 3: {2, 20, 17, 10}
- Node 4: {22, 0, 15}
- Node 5: {21}
- Node 7: {12, 13}
- Node 8: {12, 24, 19, 20, 14}
- Node 9: {26, 22, 0, 27}
- Node 10: {1, 3}
- Node 11: {26, 22, 1}
- Node 12: {7, 24, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {7, 24}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 1}
- Node 15: {16, 19, 25, 4}
- Node 16: {28, 15}
- Node 17: {3, 0, 23}
- Node 18: {23, 0}
- Node 19: {8, 15}
- Node 20: {29, 3, 8, 23}
- Node 21: {5, 23}
- Node 22: {9, 26, 4, 11}
- Node 23: {20, 17, 18, 21}
- Node 24: {26, 12, 8, 13}
- Node 25: {27, 15}
- Node 26: {9, 22, 24, 11}
- Node 27: {29, 25, 9}
- Node 28: {2, 16}
- Node 29: {2, 27, 20, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (3-stars = 10)
- Node 3: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (3-stars = 10)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)
- Node 20: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)
- Node 22: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)
- Node 23: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)
- Node 24: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)
- Node 26: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)
- Node 29: 4 neighbors (3-stars = 4)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 9, 29, 27>
- <0, 9, 29, 17>
- <0, 9, 4, 22>
- <0, 9, 4, 26>
- <0, 29, 2, 3>
- <0, 29, 2, 14>
- <3, 2, 14, 8>
- <3, 2, 14, 1>
- <8, 14, 1, 10>
- <8, 14, 1, 11>
- <9, 26, 22, 11>
- <9, 26, 24, 12>
- <12, 24, 26, 11>
- <15, 4, 22, 11>
- <23, 17, 3, 2>
- <23, 17, 0, 4>
- <23, 17, 0, 18>
- <23, 17, 0, 29>
- <23, 20, 29, 27>
- <24, 26, 22, 4>
- <24, 26, 22, 11>
- <24, 26, 22, 9>
- <25, 27, 9, 26>
- <26, 9, 0, 4>
- <26, 9, 0, 18>
- <26, 9, 0, 29>
