Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 15) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (2, 14) (2, 12) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 18) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 19) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 9) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (10, 0) (10, 9) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 7, 10, 18, 19
Node 1: 5, 9, 13, 15, 17
Node 2: 7, 12, 14
Node 3: 8, 11, 16, 18
Node 4: 5, 8
Node 5: 1, 4, 13
Node 6: 11
Node 7: 0, 12, 14
Node 8: 3, 4, 18
Node 9: 1, 10
Node 10: 0, 9
Node 11: 3, 6, 13
Node 12: 0, 7, 13, 18
Node 13: 1, 5, 11, 12
Node 14: 2, 7, 17
Node 15: 1, 16, 19
Node 16: 3, 15
Node 17: 1, 14, 19
Node 18: 0, 3, 8, 12
Node 19: 0, 15, 17

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
From the above neighbor list, nodes 1, 3, 13, and 18 have 5 neighbors each.
So, the number of 3-stars is \( \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 13, 15)>
<3, (11, 16, 18)>
<13, (1, 5, 12)>
<18, (3, 8, 12)>
