Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node \(0\) neighbors: 1, 6, 12 (3 neighbors)
Node \(1\) neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 11 (4 neighbors)
Node \(2\) neighbors: 1, 9, 13 (3 neighbors)
Node \(3\) neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11 (6 neighbors)
Node \(4\) neighbors: 3, 6, 10, 11 (4 neighbors)
Node \(5\) neighbors: 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 (5 neighbors)
Node \(6\) neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 8, 10 (5 neighbors)
Node \(7\) neighbors: 5, 8, 9, 10, 12 (5 neighbors)
Node \(8\) neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14 (6 neighbors)
Node \(9\) neighbors: 2, 7, 11, 12, 14 (5 neighbors)
Node \(10\) neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (5 neighbors)
Node \(11\) neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 (5 neighbors)
Node \(12\) neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
Node \(13\) neighbors: 2 (1 neighbor)
Node \(14\) neighbors: 8, 9 (2 neighbors)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 57, so we have \([57]\) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 3>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 10>, <3, 8, 10>, <3, 10, 11>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 10>, <6, 8, 10>, <8, 9, 14>, <8, 10, 6>.
