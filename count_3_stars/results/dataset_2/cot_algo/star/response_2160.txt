Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 3) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 12) (7, 21) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 4) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 17) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 28) (9, 14) (5, 22) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 20) (14, 13) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 25) (19, 26) (19, 15) (26, 28) (26, 19) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (12, 29) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 24) (22, 2) (22, 5) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 17) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 27) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 28) (27, 29) (27, 1) (27, 16) (16, 27) (16, 17) (16, 8) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 18) (20, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (24, 12) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (8, 0) (8, 16) (8, 18) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 1) (23, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 14, 18, 8, 23}
- Node 1: {11, 13, 27}
- Node 2: {29, 22, 13, 15, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {21, 12, 13, 3}
- Node 5: {22, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 25, 12}
- Node 7: {21, 15, 10, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 16, 18}
- Node 9: {7, 6, 25, 28, 14}
- Node 10: {7}
- Node 11: {1, 17}
- Node 12: {29, 6, 4, 24}
- Node 13: {2, 14, 4, 1}
- Node 14: {9, 0, 20, 13}
- Node 15: {2, 7, 19, 17}
- Node 16: {27, 17, 8}
- Node 17: {11, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 18: {0, 17, 8}
- Node 19: {26, 15}
- Node 20: {14}
- Node 21: {7, 28, 4}
- Node 22: {2, 5}
- Node 23: {0}
- Node 24: {12}
- Node 25: {6, 9, 28}
- Node 26: {19, 28}
- Node 27: {29, 1, 16}
- Node 28: {21, 9, 26, 25}
- Node 29: {2, 27, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Remaining nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \). Thus, the final answer is [46].
