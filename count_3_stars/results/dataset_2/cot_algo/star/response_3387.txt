Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (14, 12) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 4, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 6, 7, 8, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 6, 9, 0}
- Node 14: {12}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <0, (3, 6, 12)>
  - <0, (3, 6, 13)>
  
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <1, (2, 5, 11)>
  - <1, (2, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
  
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <3, (0, 6, 12)>
  - <3, (0, 6, 13)>
  
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (1, 2, 13)>
  
There are no more nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars is 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 38.
Therefore, the answer is [38].
