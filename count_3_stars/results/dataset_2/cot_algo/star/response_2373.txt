Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the final number to be placed inside brackets is [34].

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 8)>
