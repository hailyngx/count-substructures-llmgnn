Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 10}
- Node 1: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 8, 9, 10, 3}
- Node 8: {7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 11: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 9, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 3, 7, 9, and 13 have 5 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 11, 12)>
<13, (3, 11, 12)>
