Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (26, 14) (26, 15) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 21) (5, 16) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 7) (2, 15) (29, 5) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 25) (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 16) (8, 21) (13, 12) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 6) (25, 29) (25, 3) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 20) (27, 12) (0, 28) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 24) (6, 1) (10, 11) (10, 23) (10, 28) (11, 4) (11, 20) (11, 10) (11, 18) (23, 10) (23, 15) (23, 16) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 28) (21, 5) (21, 8) (14, 26) (14, 4) (14, 28) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 1) (19, 2) (19, 18) (22, 4) (22, 28) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 16) (17, 3) (17, 24) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 23) (28, 0) (28, 10) (28, 24) (28, 14) (28, 22) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 28
- Node 1: 6, 18, 16
- Node 2: 29, 19, 7, 15
- Node 3: 7, 25, 17, 6
- Node 4: 7, 22, 14, 11
- Node 5: 9, 6, 29, 21, 16
- Node 6: 5, 3, 24, 1
- Node 7: 9, 2, 4, 3
- Node 8: 16, 21
- Node 9: 5, 7, 12
- Node 10: 11, 23, 28
- Node 11: 4, 20, 10, 18
- Node 12: 9, 13, 27, 20
- Node 13: 12
- Node 14: 26, 4, 28
- Node 15: 26, 2, 23
- Node 16: 5, 8, 23, 1
- Node 17: 3, 24
- Node 18: 11, 19, 1
- Node 19: 2, 18
- Node 20: 29, 12, 11
- Node 21: 5, 8
- Node 22: 4, 28
- Node 23: 10, 15, 16
- Node 24: 6, 17, 28
- Node 25: 29, 3
- Node 26: 14, 15
- Node 27: 12
- Node 28: 0, 10, 24, 14, 22
- Node 29: 5, 2, 20, 25

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 5, 7, 2, 4, 9, 6, 12, 11, 28, 16, 29, 18, 1, 20, 23, 15

Number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 20: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, 6, 9>, <5, 6, 21>, <5, 6, 29>, <5, 6, 16>, <5, 16, 8>, <5, 16, 1>, <5, 16, 23>, <5, 16, 9>, <7, 2, 4>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 2, 9>, <7, 2, 15>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 25>, <2, 3, 29>, <2, 3, 15>, <4, 11, 20>, <4, 11, 28>, <4, 11, 18>, <4, 11, 10>, <9, 12, 27>, <9, 12, 20>, <9, 12, 13>, <6, 1, 18>, <6, 1, 16>, <6, 1, 17>, <6, 1, 24>, <12, 20, 11>, <12, 20, 29>, <12, 20, 27>, <11, 18, 1>, <11, 18, 19>, <11, 18, 20>, <28, 22, 4>, <28, 22, 14>, <28, 22, 24>, <28, 22, 10>, <16, 1, 18>, <16, 1, 23>, <16, 1, 6>, <16, 1, 8>, <28, 24, 17>, <28, 24, 14>, <28, 24, 6>, <28, 24, 10>, <29, 25, 3>, <29, 25, 2>, <29, 25, 20>, <29, 25, 21>, <20, 11, 18>, <20, 11, 29>, <20, 11, 12>, <20, 11, 4>, <23, 16, 1>, <23, 16, 15>, <23, 16, 5>, <23, 16, 8>
