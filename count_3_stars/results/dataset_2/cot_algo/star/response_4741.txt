Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 10) (16, 6) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 19) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 5) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 2) (5, 14) (9, 4) (2, 17) (2, 12) (18, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 7) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {18, 7, 12, 19}
- Node 1: {10, 13}
- Node 2: {17, 12}
- Node 3: {10, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 19, 10}
- Node 5: {14}
- Node 6: {11, 16, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 8}
- Node 8: {11, 3, 17, 7}
- Node 9: {4}
- Node 10: {16, 3, 1, 4, 13}
- Node 11: {16, 13, 6, 8}
- Node 12: {14, 2, 13, 0}
- Node 13: {11, 12, 1, 6, 10}
- Node 14: {17, 12, 5}
- Node 15: {19, 17}
- Node 16: {11, 10, 6}
- Node 17: {15, 14, 2, 8}
- Node 18: {0}
- Node 19: {15, 0, 4}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with 3, 7, and 19: <0, (3, 7, 19)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with 3, 10, and 19: <4, (3, 10, 19)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with 0, 8, and 12: <7, (0, 8, 12)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with 3, 11, and 17: <8, (3, 11, 17)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with 1, 4, and 13: <10, (1, 4, 13)>
- Node 13 forms two 3-stars: <13, (1, 10, 6)> and <13, (6, 11, 12)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with 6, 10, and 11: <16, (6, 10, 11)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7].
