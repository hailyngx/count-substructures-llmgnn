Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 9) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can start by determining the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 7, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {3, 6, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 4, 10}
- Node 10: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 11, 13}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 4 forms the 3-star <4, (7, 9, 13)>.
- Node 7 forms the 3-star <7, (1, 3, 4)>.
- Node 9 forms the 3-star <9, (0, 3, 4)>.
- Node 11 forms the 3-star <11, (6, 12, 13)>.
- Node 13 forms the 3-star <13, (5, 10, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
