Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 8, 1, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 7, 8, 6}
- Node 4: {7, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 2, 8, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 2, 6, 3, 1, 0}
- Node 9: {2, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star formations:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, leading to \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, leading to \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, leading to \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 20 = 40.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [40]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
