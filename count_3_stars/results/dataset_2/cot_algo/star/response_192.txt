Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 11) (27, 13) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 22) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (22, 7) (22, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 21) (10, 11) (10, 25) (10, 29) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 8) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 0) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 20) (5, 17) (5, 0) (13, 27) (13, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 6) (4, 23) (4, 20) (12, 18) (12, 23) (12, 19) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 25) (20, 28) (20, 4) (20, 29) (20, 8) (29, 10) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 8) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 28) (25, 10) (25, 16) (23, 4) (23, 12) (23, 9) (26, 15) (26, 2) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 29) (8, 11) (8, 20) (8, 29) (24, 0) (24, 9) (0, 18) (0, 22) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 24) (19, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 23) (9, 24) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. **Neighbor sets for each node**:
   - Node 0: {2, 5, 18, 22, 24}
   - Node 1: {3, 7, 9, 11, 14}
   - Node 2: {0, 16, 18, 26}
   - Node 3: {1, 6, 9}
   - Node 4: {12, 20, 23}
   - Node 5: {0, 17}
   - Node 6: {3, 6, 17, 29}
   - Node 7: {1, 15, 16, 21, 22}
   - Node 8: {11, 20, 29}
   - Node 9: {1, 3, 9, 23, 24}
   - Node 10: {11, 21, 25, 29}
   - Node 11: {1, 8, 10, 14, 15, 28}
   - Node 12: {4, 18, 19, 23}
   - Node 13: {17, 27}
   - Node 14: {1, 11, 28}
   - Node 15: {7, 11, 26}
   - Node 16: {2, 7, 25}
   - Node 17: {5, 6, 13}
   - Node 18: {0, 2, 12}
   - Node 19: {12}
   - Node 20: {4, 8, 28, 29}
   - Node 21: {7, 10}
   - Node 22: {0, 7}
   - Node 23: {4, 9, 12}
   - Node 24: {0, 9}
   - Node 25: {10, 16}
   - Node 26: {2, 15}
   - Node 27: {13}
   - Node 28: {11, 14, 20}
   - Node 29: {6, 8, 10, 20}

2. **3-star calculations**:
   - Node 0, Node 9, Node 11, and Node 29 have 5, 5, 6, and 4 neighbors respectively, so we can form inom{5}{3} = 10, inom{5}{3} = 10, inom{6}{3} = 20, and inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars with each of these nodes.
   
3. **Total number of 3-stars**:
   Total = 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 44
   
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 18, 22)>, <0, (2, 22, 24)>, <0, (2, 18, 24)>, <0, (2, 18, 5)>, <0, (5, 22, 24)>, <9, (1, 23, 24)>, <11, (1, 14, 28)>, <11, (1, 10, 28)>, <11, (10, 25, 29)>, <11, (10, 14, 28)>, <11, (14, 28, 20)>, <11, (14, 28, 20)>, <20, (4, 8, 29)>, <20, (8, 29, 10)>, <20, (8, 11, 29)>, <20, (11, 14, 28)>
