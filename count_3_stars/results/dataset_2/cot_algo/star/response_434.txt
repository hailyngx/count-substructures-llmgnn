Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7

Now, we'll check each node that has 3 or more neighbors to see if they can form 3-stars.

Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors so we need to check those.

For Node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For Node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For Node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For Node 9:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 9) = 30
Therefore, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
