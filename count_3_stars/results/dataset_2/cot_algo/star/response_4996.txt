Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, here is the calculation for the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0: Neighbors: 1, 7. No 3-stars formed.

2. Node 1: Neighbors: 0, 5, 9, 11. 
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

    <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 10)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 10)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 10)>, <8, (2, 9, 10)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 10)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 10)>, <8, (3, 9, 10)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 10)>, <8, (5, 9, 10)>, <8, (6, 9, 10)>.

10. Node 9: Neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14.
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
    <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 11)>, <9, (1, 7, 12)>, <9, (1, 7, 14)>, <9, (1, 8, 11)>, <9, (1, 8, 12)>, <9, (1, 8, 14)>, <9, (1, 11, 12)>, <9, (1, 11, 14)>, <9, (1, 12, 14)>, <9, (7, 8, 11)>, <9, (7, 8, 12)>, <9, (7, 8, 14)>, <9, (7, 11, 12)>, <9, (7, 11, 14)>, <9, (7, 12, 14)>, <9, (8, 11, 12)>, <9, (8, 11, 14)>, <9, (8, 12, 14)>, <9, (11, 12, 14)>.

    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
    <10, (4, 8, 13)>, <10, (4, 8, 14)>, <10, (4, 13, 14)>, <10, (8, 13, 14)>.

12. Node 11: Neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 9.
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
    <11, (1, 2, 7)>, <11, (1, 2, 9)>, <11, (1, 7, 9)>, <11, (2, 7, 9)>.

13. Node 12: Neighbors: 3, 5, 9, 13.
    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
    <12, (3, 5, 9)>, <12, (3, 5, 13)>, <12, (3, 9, 13)>, <12, (5, 9, 13)>.

    Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
    <13, (5, 6, 10)>, <13, (5, 6, 12)>, <13, (5, 6, 14)>, <13, (5, 10, 12)>, <13, (5, 10, 14)>, <13, (5, 12, 14)>, <13, (6, 10, 12)>, <13, (6, 10, 14)>, <13, (6, 12, 14)>, <13, (10, 12, 14)>.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 96.

So, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [96].
