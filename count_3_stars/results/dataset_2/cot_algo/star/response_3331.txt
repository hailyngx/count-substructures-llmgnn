Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {5, 1, 8, 2}.
- Node 1: neighbors {6, 3, 0}.
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 3, 7, 8, 0}.
- Node 3: neighbors {6, 1, 7, 2}.
- Node 4: neighbors {5, 9, 8}.
- Node 5: neighbors {9, 6, 2, 4, 0}.
- Node 6: neighbors {5, 1, 7, 3}.
- Node 7: neighbors {9, 6, 3, 2}.
- Node 8: neighbors {9, 4, 2, 0}.
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 8, 4, 7}.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 2: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 = 14

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
