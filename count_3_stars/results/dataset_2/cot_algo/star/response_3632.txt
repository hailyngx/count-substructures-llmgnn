Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 11) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (5, 4) (5, 12) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 0) (14, 19) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list for easier visualization:

Node 0: 11
Node 1: 10, 16
Node 2: 8, 12
Node 3: 12, 19
Node 4: 6, 18, 5, 16
Node 5: 4, 12
Node 6: 17, 19, 4
Node 7: 9, 13
Node 8: 13, 2, 16, 11
Node 9: 18, 16, 7
Node 10: 17, 18, 1
Node 11: 8, 17, 18, 0
Node 12: 17, 2, 5, 3
Node 13: 8, 19, 7
Node 14: 19
Node 15: 19, 16
Node 16: 9, 8, 4, 15, 1
Node 17: 6, 10, 12, 11
Node 18: 9, 10, 4, 11
Node 19: 6, 13, 3, 15, 14

Next, we'll identify the 3-stars present in this graph:

Node 17 has 4 neighbors: {6, 10, 12, 11}
Number of 3-stars formed at Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<17, (6, 10, 12)>, <17, (6, 10, 11)>, <17, (6, 12, 11)>, <17, (10, 12, 11)>

Node 18 has 4 neighbors: {9, 10, 4, 11}
Number of 3-stars formed at Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<18, (9, 10, 4)>, <18, (9, 10, 11)>, <18, (9, 4, 11)>, <18, (10, 4, 11)>

Now, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 (from Node 17) + 4 (from Node 18) = 8, so the final answer is [8].
