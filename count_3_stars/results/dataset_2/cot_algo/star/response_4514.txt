Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 1, 4, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 7 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is 10 + 4 + 35 = 49, so the final answer is [49].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
