Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

\[ \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]

\[ = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 \]

\[ = 41 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, 2, 1, 3>
<0, 2, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 4, 6>
<0, 3, 7, 8>
<0, 3, 7, 9>
<2, 4, 6, 5>
<2, 4, 7, 8>
<2, 6, 4, 5>
<4, 6, 5, 7>
<4, 6, 5, 8>
<4, 7, 3, 9>
<4, 8, 3, 7>
<5, 7, 3, 8>
<5, 7, 3, 0>
<5, 8, 3, 7>
<5, 8, 3, 0>
<6, 0, 2, 4>
<7, 3, 0, 5>
<7, 4, 2, 6>
<8, 3, 0, 5>
<8, 4, 2, 6>
<9, 1, 0, 2>
