Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 18) (17, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 17) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 18) (0, 5) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 18) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 5
Node 1 neighbors: 6, 13
Node 2 neighbors: 8, 11, 17
Node 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 7, 14, 17
Node 4 neighbors: 8, 11, 13, 14
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 11
Node 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 9, 12
Node 7 neighbors: 3, 9, 19
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 4, 16, 19
Node 9 neighbors: 6, 7, 9, 18
Node 10 neighbors: 11, 17
Node 11 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 10
Node 12 neighbors: 6
Node 13 neighbors: 1, 4
Node 14 neighbors: 3, 4, 15
Node 15 neighbors: 14, 16
Node 16 neighbors: 8, 15, 18
Node 17 neighbors: 2, 10, 17, 18
Node 18 neighbors: 9, 16, 17, 19
Node 19 neighbors: 7, 8, 18

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 3, 4, 8, 9, 11, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 3 has 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
Node 4 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 8 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 9 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 11 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 17 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 18 has 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
Node 19 has 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (5, 6, 17)>, <4, (8, 11, 14)>, <8, (2, 16, 19)>, <9, (6, 7, 18)>, <11, (2, 5, 17)>, <17, (2, 10, 18)>, <18, (9, 16, 17)>, and <19, (7, 8, 18)>.
