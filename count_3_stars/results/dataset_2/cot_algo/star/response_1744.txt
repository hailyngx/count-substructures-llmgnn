Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 6, 4, 8, 2, 9
Node 1: 9, 8, 7
Node 2: 8, 0, 4, 3
Node 3: 5, 6, 4, 2
Node 4: 5, 3, 0, 2
Node 5: 9, 8, 4, 3, 7
Node 6: 9, 3, 0
Node 7: 5, 1
Node 8: 9, 5, 1, 2, 0
Node 9: 5, 6, 8, 1, 0

Next, we need to identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed by each one:

Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 48. So, the final answer is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, 3, 4, 7>
<5, 3, 8, 9>
<5, 4, 9, 8>
<5, 7, 1, 8>
<5, 7, 9, 8>
<5, 3, 6, 9>
<5, 9, 1, 8>
<5, 9, 0, 6>
<5, 9, 0, 8>
<3, 4, 0, 2>
<3, 4, 8, 2>
<3, 4, 2, 8>
<3, 6, 0, 9>
<4, 0, 6, 9>
<4, 0, 8, 2>
<4, 2, 0, 8>
<0, 9, 6, 3>
<0, 9, 8, 2>
<0, 6, 3, 4>
<0, 6, 8, 2>
