Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 0) (13, 15) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 16) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 7) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 17) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 13, 2}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 17, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 17, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 14, 16}
- Node 6: {7, 14, 15}
- Node 7: {6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7}
- Node 9: {3, 5}
- Node 10: {13, 15, 19}
- Node 11: {4, 14, 18}
- Node 12: {1, 17}
- Node 13: {0, 15}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 11, 18}
- Node 15: {6, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 16: {5, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 3, 12}
- Node 18: {11, 14}
- Node 19: {3, 10, 15, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Node 2: {0, 1, 17, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Node 3: {1, 9, 17, 19} (4 neighbors)
- Node 5: {2, 9, 14, 16} (4 neighbors)
- Node 14: {5, 6, 11, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Node 15: {6, 10, 13, 19} (4 neighbors)
- Node 19: {3, 10, 15, 16} (4 neighbors)

Now, for each of these nodes with 4 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Since each of these nodes contributes 4 3-stars, and there are 8 such nodes, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:

\[ 4 \times 8 = 32 \]

Therefore, the final value to be placed inside brackets is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 4>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 2, 17>
- <1, 2, 17>
- <1, 2, 5>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 3, 17>
- <2, 5, 16>
- <3, 9, 19>
- <5, 14, 16>
- <6, 14, 15>
- <10, 13, 15>
- <10, 15, 19>
- <11, 14, 18>
- <14, 18, 11>
