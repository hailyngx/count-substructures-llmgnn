Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 4) (9, 2) (26, 22) (26, 27) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 24) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 28) (28, 13) (29, 16) (29, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 11) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 10) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 12) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 0) (6, 16) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 25) (16, 20) (23, 20) (23, 27) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 27) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 24) (18, 10) (18, 25) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 19) (27, 10) (3, 13) (3, 29) (3, 19) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 27) (20, 16) (20, 23) (12, 8) (12, 14) (17, 15) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 16) (25, 18) (25, 15) (24, 1) (24, 5) (15, 17) (15, 25) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 1
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 2
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 5
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 5
- Node 28: degree 1
- Node 29: degree 2

To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors
- Node 5: has 5 neighbors
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors
- Node 8: has 6 neighbors
- Node 16: has 4 neighbors
- Node 27: has 5 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50 3-stars in the graph, which we will represent as [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
- <4, (9, 21, 22)>
- <5, (21, 7, 25)>
- <8, (1, 2, 13)>
- <27, (26, 19, 22)>
