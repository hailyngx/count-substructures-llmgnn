Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 0) (22, 17) (20, 1) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 29) (23, 7) (23, 3) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 29) (8, 0) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 19) (26, 25) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 12) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 12) (7, 18) (7, 23) (7, 0) (3, 23) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 2) (21, 18) (21, 3) (21, 29) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 2) (4, 27) (27, 18) (27, 4) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 5) (12, 26) (12, 28) (12, 19) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 14) (6, 24) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 6) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 15) (15, 9) (29, 25) (29, 11) (29, 26) (29, 21) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 22, 8, 7, 19
- Node 1: 20, 28, 14
- Node 2: 10, 3, 16, 5
- Node 3: 23, 7, 21, 16, 2
- Node 4: 27
- Node 5: 11, 17, 2
- Node 6: 24
- Node 7: 18, 23, 0
- Node 8: 22, 0
- Node 9: 17, 14, 15
- Node 10: 11, 19, 2
- Node 11: 10, 14, 5, 29
- Node 12: 26, 28, 19
- Node 13: 16, 17, 19
- Node 14: 1, 11, 9
- Node 15: 9
- Node 16: 28, 3, 24, 13, 2
- Node 17: 22, 25, 13, 9, 5
- Node 18: 27, 24, 7, 21
- Node 19: 10, 0, 13, 12
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 18, 3, 29
- Node 22: 0, 17
- Node 23: 7, 3
- Node 24: 18, 16, 6
- Node 25: 17, 26, 29
- Node 26: 25, 28, 29, 12
- Node 27: 18, 4
- Node 28: 26, 16, 1, 12
- Node 29: 25, 11, 26, 21

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 7, Node 16, Node 17, Node 11, Node 13, Node 19, Node 25, Node 26, Node 28, and Node 29.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding the 3-stars formed by each of these nodes: 
\( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 64 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

Here are the unique 3-stars found: 
- <0, 8, 19>
- <0, 7, 18>
- <0, 7, 23>
- <0, 19, 10>
- <2, 3, 16>
- <2, 5, 11>
- <2, 5, 17>
- <3, 16, 28>
- <3, 21, 29>
- <5, 11, 29>
- <9, 14, 11>
- <9, 15, 17>
- <11, 14, 1>
- <13, 16, 28>
- <13, 16, 17>
- <13, 17, 9>
- <16, 24, 18>
- <19, 12, 26>
- <19, 13, 17>
- <25, 26, 29>
