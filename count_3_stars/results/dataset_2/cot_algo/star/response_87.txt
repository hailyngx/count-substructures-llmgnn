- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 22, 24, 28. <9, (22, 24, 28)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with leaves 14, 19, 24. <11, (14, 19, 24)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 10, 16, 19. <12, (10, 16, 19)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with leaves 14, 17, 25. <13, (14, 17, 25)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with leaves 20, 27, 11. <14, (20, 27, 11)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 26, 8. <15, (6, 26, 8)>
