Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0 neighbors: 1, 8, 2, 9 (degree 4)
Node 1 neighbors: 4, 0 (degree 2)
Node 2 neighbors: 8, 5, 9, 3, 0 (degree 5)
Node 3 neighbors: 7, 6, 9, 2 (degree 4)
Node 4 neighbors: 7, 9, 5, 1, 6 (degree 5)
Node 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 8, 2 (degree 4)
Node 6 neighbors: 4, 7, 3 (degree 3)
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 3, 6, 9, 5 (degree 5)
Node 8 neighbors: 2, 5, 0 (degree 3)
Node 9 neighbors: 4, 7, 3, 2, 0 (degree 5)

Applying the combinatorial calculation, we get:
Node 0: [C(4, 3)] = 4
Node 2: [C(5, 3)] = 10
Node 3: [C(4, 3)] = 4
Node 4: [C(5, 3)] = 10
Node 5: [C(4, 3)] = 4
Node 7: [C(5, 3)] = 10
Node 9: [C(5, 3)] = 10

Summing these up, we have a total of [42] 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, 8, 2, 9>
<2, 8, 5, 3>
<3, 7, 6, 9>
<4, 7, 9, 5>
<5, 4, 7, 8>
<7, 4, 9, 5>
<9, 4, 7, 3>
