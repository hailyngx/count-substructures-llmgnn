Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 9, 3, 14, 2, 13
- Node 1 neighbors: 3, 13, 4, 12
- Node 2 neighbors: 9, 4, 0
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 11, 7, 0, 13, 12
- Node 4 neighbors: 1, 2
- Node 5 neighbors: 10, 8, 12
- Node 6 neighbors: 9, 7, 10, 13
- Node 7 neighbors: 6, 3, 10
- Node 8 neighbors: 11, 5, 14, 12
- Node 9 neighbors: 6, 2, 11, 0, 12
- Node 10 neighbors: 6, 11, 7, 5
- Node 11 neighbors: 9, 3, 10, 8, 12
- Node 12 neighbors: 1, 3, 11, 8, 5
- Node 13 neighbors: 6, 1, 3, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars. We can see that nodes 0, 3, 11, and 12 have 5 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50 3-stars in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 9, 13)>, <3, (1, 11, 12)>.
