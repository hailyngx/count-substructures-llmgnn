Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 13) 

Response:
The central idea is to check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if there are 3-stars centered at that node. Let's go through each node:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 11, 12)
  - <0, (4, 11, 12)>
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 8, 10)
  - <1, (2, 8, 10)>
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors (1, 13, 14), so no 3-star
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors (5, 8, 10, 11)
  - <3, (5, 10, 11)>
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors (0, 6, 10, 11, 14)
  - <4, (0, 10, 11)>
- Node 5: has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9), so no 3-star
- Node 6: has 5 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 9, 10)
  - <6, (1, 4, 10)>
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors (0, 8), so no 3-star
- Node 8: has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 7, 9, 11)
  - <8, (1, 3, 11)>
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 13)
  - <9, (5, 6, 13)>
- Node 10: has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 6, 11)
  - <10, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 11: has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8, 10)
  - <11, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 12: has 3 neighbors (0, 13, 14), so no 3-star
- Node 13: has 4 neighbors (2, 9, 12, 14)
  - <13, (2, 9, 14)>
- Node 14: has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 12, 13)
  - <14, (2, 4, 13)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [6].
