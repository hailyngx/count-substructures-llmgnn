Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {8, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 2}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 14: {7, 12}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [60].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 13>, <1, 4, 5>, <1, 4, 13>, <1, 7, 13>, <1, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 8>, <3, 1, 5>, <3, 1, 8>, <3, 2, 5>, <3, 2, 8>
<5, 7, 12>, <5, 10, 12>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 10, 14>
<7, 10, 11>, <7, 10, 14>, <7, 11, 14>
<10, 12, 14>
