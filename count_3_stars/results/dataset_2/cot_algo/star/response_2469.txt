Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 15) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 6) (5, 6) (5, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (9, 4) (9, 11) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 12) (4, 19) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 15) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 14) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 10) (16, 5) 

Response:
Firstly, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 18}
- Node 1: {2, 10, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {2, 10, 12, 16}
- Node 4: {9, 11, 19}
- Node 5: {6, 16}
- Node 6: {5, 14, 17}
- Node 7: {11, 14, 15, 18}
- Node 8: {13}
- Node 9: {4, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 15, 16, 17}
- Node 11: {4, 7, 9, 19}
- Node 12: {3, 15}
- Node 13: {8, 15, 16}
- Node 14: {6, 7, 18}
- Node 15: {7, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 16: {3, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 17: {6, 10}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 7, 14}
- Node 19: {4, 11}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 31, which can be represented as [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 2, 10, 18>, <3, 10, 13, 16>, <10, 15, 16, 17>, <7, 14, 18, 19>, <3, 12, 15, 16>, <4, 11, 19>, <1, 10, 18>, <10, 17, 6>, <7, 14, 18, 11>, <7, 14, 18, 15>
