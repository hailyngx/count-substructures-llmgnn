Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 3, 4, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6
- Node 9: 4, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them.

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>.
