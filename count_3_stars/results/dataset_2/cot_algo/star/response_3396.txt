Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {5, 6}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
