Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 5) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (2, 8) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 12) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 13) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 13) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 10) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 10) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can first identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {4, 9, 16, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 18}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 14, 19}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 12}
- Node 5: {13, 14, 17}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 19}
- Node 7: {10, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {2, 10, 17}
- Node 9: {0, 15}
- Node 10: {6, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 6, 15}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 18}
- Node 13: {5, 15, 14, 19}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 13}
- Node 15: {7, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 16: {0, 7}
- Node 17: {5, 8}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 12}
- Node 19: {3, 6, 13}

Nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 1 3-star each.
- For nodes with more than 3 neighbors: \( \binom{n}{3} \) 3-stars each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 14 3-stars.
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 
  - Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 14 (from nodes with 3 neighbors) + 12 (from nodes with more than 3 neighbors) = 26.

Therefore, the final answer is [26], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 12, 18)>
<1, (3, 11, 18)>
<3, (1, 4, 19)>
<10, (6, 8, 12)>
<13, (5, 15, 19)>
<15, (7, 11, 13)>
