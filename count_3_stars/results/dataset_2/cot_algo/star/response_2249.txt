Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node using the given edge list:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 6, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 8, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {6, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {8, 1, 4, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 7, 5, 0, 4, 8, 3}
- Node 7: {6, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 0}


Now, let's identify the 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars. 

In this case, only node 6 has 8 neighbors, so it can form multiple 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by node 6:
\[ \binom{8}{3} = 56 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 56, and it should be represented as [56].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 7, 2)>
<6, (0, 9, 2)>
<6, (0, 5, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 3)>
<6, (5, 8, 2)>
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<6, (8, 2, 1)>
<6, (8, 2, 7)>
