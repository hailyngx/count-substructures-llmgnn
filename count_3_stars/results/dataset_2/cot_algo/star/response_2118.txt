Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 13, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 10}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 8, 10}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {8, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 9, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 7, 10, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [C(3, 3)] = 1
- Node 1: [C(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 2: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 4: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 6: [C(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 8: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 9: [C(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 10: [C(6, 3)] = 20
- Node 11: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 13: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 14: [C(4, 3)] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 71

Therefore, the final answer is [71], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 13, 14)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 10)>, <1, (4, 6, 11)>, <1, (4, 8, 11)>, <1, (6, 8, 10)>, <1, (6, 8, 11)>, <1, (6, 10, 11)>, <1, (7, 14, 0)>, <1, (7, 14, 10)>, <2, (0, 3, 13)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 10)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 10)>, <9, (2, 5, 13)>, <9, (2, 10, 11)>, <9, (5, 10, 11)>, <10, (3, 6, 14)>, <11, (1, 9, 10)>, <14, (0, 12, 14)>, <14, (7, 10, 14)>
