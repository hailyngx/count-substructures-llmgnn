Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {6, 8}
- Node 1: {7, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 3: {2, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 9, 10}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 10, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 12}
- Node 10: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 11: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {5, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 13}

From the neighbor sets above, we see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 13.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding them up, we get a total of 68 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (3, 7, 14)>
<4, (3, 5, 10)>
<5, (4, 7, 12)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 10)>
<6, (4, 9, 10)>
<7, (1, 2, 14)>
<7, (2, 5, 12)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 14)>
<8, (5, 11, 13)>
<12, (4, 7, 13)>
<12, (5, 7, 13)>
<12, (5, 11, 13)>
<12, (7, 11, 13)>
<13, (11, 12, 14)>
