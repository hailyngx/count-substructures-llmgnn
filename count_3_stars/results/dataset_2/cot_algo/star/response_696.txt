Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. 

Let's start by listing the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8

Now let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 53

Therefore, the final answer is [53].

Unique 3-stars found: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 4, 5>, <1, 2, 9>, <3, 6, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <6, 7, 9>.
