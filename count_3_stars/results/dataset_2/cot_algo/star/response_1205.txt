Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 11, 14} (Degree 5)
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 8} (Degree 4)
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 9, 10, 11} (Degree 5)
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 12, 14} (Degree 5)
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 6} (Degree 3)
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 12} (Degree 6)
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 12} (Degree 6)
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 14} (Degree 4)
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 14} (Degree 2)
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 6, 14} (Degree 3)
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 12, 13} (Degree 3)
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 2, 13} (Degree 3)
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 10} (Degree 4)
- Node 13: Neighbors {10, 11} (Degree 2)
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9, 7} (Degree 5)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 84

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, 4, 11>, 
<0, 4, 14>, 
<0, 5, 7>, 
<0, 5, 11>, 
<0, 5, 14>, 
<1, 3, 5>, 
<1, 3, 12>, 
<1, 5, 6>, 
<1, 5, 7>, 
<2, 4, 6>, 
<2, 4, 11>, 
<2, 5, 6>, 
<2, 6, 12>, 
<3, 5, 12>, 
<3, 5, 14>, 
<3, 7, 14>, 
<5, 6, 12>, 
<5, 6, 14>, 
<6, 9, 14>, 
<10, 12, 13>
