Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 28) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 29) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 10) (27, 16) (6, 23) (9, 17) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 25) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 19) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 24) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 28) (5, 4) (5, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 14) (11, 4) (23, 6) (23, 26) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (16, 13) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 1) (26, 20) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 3) (10, 27) (10, 25) (10, 26) (24, 1) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 18) (14, 19) (29, 22) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 0) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 28) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 18) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {13, 9, 29, 18}
- Node 1: {17, 16, 24}
- Node 2: {13, 7, 19}
- Node 3: {7, 26, 18}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 5, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 19}
- Node 6: {23}
- Node 7: {21, 2, 17, 3, 12}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {17, 0}
- Node 10: {27, 25, 26}
- Node 11: {4}
- Node 12: {7, 4, 25}
- Node 13: {22, 16, 2, 28, 0}
- Node 14: {19}
- Node 15: {27, 20, 29}
- Node 16: {13, 27, 21, 1}
- Node 17: {9, 7, 1, 28}
- Node 18: {3, 0, 28}
- Node 19: {20, 2, 5, 14}
- Node 20: {15, 26, 19}
- Node 21: {7, 16}
- Node 22: {13, 28, 29}
- Node 23: {6, 26}
- Node 24: {1}
- Node 25: {27, 12, 10}
- Node 26: {20, 23, 10, 3}
- Node 27: {15, 25, 29, 10, 16}
- Node 28: {22, 17, 18, 13}
- Node 29: {15, 27, 0, 22}

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 15: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 16: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 17: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 19: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 20: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 22: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 25: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 27: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 29: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [58]. 

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, 13, 9, 29>
<2, 13, 7, 19>
<4, 8, 12, 5>
<7, 21, 16, 1>
<12, 7, 4, 25>
<13, 22, 28, 0>
<15, 27, 29, 0>
<16, 13, 27, 21>
<17, 9, 7, 1>
<19, 20, 2, 5>
<26, 20, 23, 10>
<27, 15, 25, 10>
<28, 22, 17, 18>
