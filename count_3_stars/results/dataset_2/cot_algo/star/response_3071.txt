Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (3, 4) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 19) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 2) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 17) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 9) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 10, 14, 17
Node 1: 4, 13, 16
Node 2: 8, 10, 14, 18
Node 3: 4, 18
Node 4: 1, 3, 13, 18
Node 5: 6, 7, 12, 19
Node 6: 5, 19
Node 7: 5, 11, 17, 18
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 10, 11, 17
Node 10: 0, 2, 9, 11
Node 11: 7, 9, 10
Node 12: 5, 18, 19
Node 13: 1, 4, 16
Node 14: 0, 2
Node 16: 1, 13
Node 17: 0, 7, 9, 19
Node 18: 2, 3, 4, 7, 12
Node 19: 5, 6, 12, 17

Now, let's calculate how many 3-stars are formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].
