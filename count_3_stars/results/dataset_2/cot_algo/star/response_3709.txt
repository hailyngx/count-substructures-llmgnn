Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 8) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 16) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 14) (6, 0) (6, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 2) (18, 6) 

Response:
First, we will construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 17, 19}
- Node 2: {9, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 3: {1, 8, 17}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 15}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 18}
- Node 7: {0, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {3, 10, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 8, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 5, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 9, 10, 15}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 8}
- Node 15: {4, 7, 13}
- Node 16: {2, 17}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 16}
- Node 18: {6}

Now we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 5: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: 5 neighbors, \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 13: 4 neighbors, \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star
- Node 15: 3 neighbors, 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 40. So the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 7, 10)>, <0, (6, 7, 12)>, <0, (6, 10, 12)>, <0, (7, 10, 12)>, <2, (9, 13, 14)>, <2, (9, 13, 16)>, <2, (9, 14, 16)>, <2, (13, 14, 16)>, <5, (4, 12, 14)>, <5, (9, 12, 14)>, <5, (9, 4, 14)>, <5, (9, 4, 12)>, <9, (10, 13, 15)>, <9, (10, 13, 2)>, <9, (10, 13, 5)>, <9, (10, 15, 2)>, <9, (10, 15, 5)>, <9, (13, 2, 5)>, <9, (13, 15, 2)>, <9, (13, 15, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 14)>, <10, (13, 15, 2)>, <10, (13, 15, 5)>, <10, (13, 2, 5)>, <10, (15, 2, 5)>, <10, (8, 14, 15)>, <12, (0, 10, 5)>, <13, (2, 15, 9)>, <14, (2, 5, 8)>, <15, (4, 7, 13)>
