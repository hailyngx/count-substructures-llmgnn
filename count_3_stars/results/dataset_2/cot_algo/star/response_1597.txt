Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 3, 8, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 7, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {7, 1, 0, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 0, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 2}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 1, 3, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 3, 6, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 2}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-star graphs:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 3, 8)>, 
<1, (3, 6, 2)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 1)>, 
<3, (7, 1, 6)>, 
<6, (4, 7, 0)>, 
<7, (4, 3, 6)>, 
<8, (9, 7, 1)>.
