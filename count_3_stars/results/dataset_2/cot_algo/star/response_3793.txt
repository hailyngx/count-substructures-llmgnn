Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 9, 13, 14
- Node 1: 5, 7, 11, 14
- Node 2: 0, 3, 11
- Node 3: 0, 2, 9
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9, 10
- Node 5: 1, 6, 8, 9, 12
- Node 6: 4, 5, 12, 13, 14
- Node 7: 1, 13, 14, 12
- Node 8: 4, 5, 14
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5
- Node 10: 4, 14
- Node 11: 1, 2, 13
- Node 12: 5, 6, 7, 13
- Node 13: 0, 6, 7, 11, 12
- Node 14: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 2, 3, 9, 13, 14 - forms 1 3-star
- Node 1: 5, 7, 11, 14 - forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: 4, 5, 12, 13, 14 - forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: 0, 6, 7, 11, 12 - forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10 - forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 9, 13)>, <1, (5, 7, 14)>, <6, (4, 5, 12)>, <13, (0, 6, 7)>, <14, (0, 1, 4)>
