Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 19) (27, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 10) (22, 20) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 20) (18, 1) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 25) (6, 27) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 19) (9, 0) (9, 11) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 25) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 29) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (29, 4) (29, 26) (29, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 15) (21, 2) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 13) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 20) (7, 0) (7, 23) (7, 5) (15, 6) (15, 14) (16, 28) (16, 25) (16, 5) (13, 28) (13, 11) (13, 25) (26, 2) (26, 29) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 16) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 29) (24, 11) (19, 27) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 20) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 11) (20, 19) (10, 3) (10, 22) (25, 18) (25, 2) (25, 16) (25, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {27, 7, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 14, 28, 18}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {18, 12, 26, 21, 25}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 14, 10}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {8, 19, 29}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {8, 7, 16}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {27, 23, 15, 19}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 23, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {4, 5, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {0, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {3, 22}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {9, 24, 13, 20}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {2, 8, 29}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {28, 11, 25}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {1, 3, 15}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {6, 14}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {28, 5, 25}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {1, 22, 2, 25}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {27, 6, 4, 20}
- Node 20: Neighbors = {22, 23, 11, 19}
- Node 21: Neighbors = {2}
- Node 22: Neighbors = {23, 18, 10, 20}
- Node 23: Neighbors = {22, 7, 6, 20}
- Node 24: Neighbors = {11}
- Node 25: Neighbors = {18, 2, 16, 13}
- Node 26: Neighbors = {2, 29}
- Node 27: Neighbors = {0, 19, 6}
- Node 28: Neighbors = {1, 16, 13}
- Node 29: Neighbors = {4, 26, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 27, and Node 6 can each form a 3-star (as they have 3 neighbors each), resulting in 3 * 1 = 3 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 3, Node 8, Node 11, Node 14, and Node 25 can each form a 3-star (as they have more than 3 neighbors), resulting in 6 * inom{4}{3} = 24 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3 + 24] = [27].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, 7, 27>
- <6, 19, 27>
- <6, 23, 27>
- <9, 11, 20>
- <1, 3, 14>
- <1, 3, 18>
- <1, 3, 28>
- <1, 14, 15>
- <1, 18, 25>
- <1, 28, 13>
- <3, 10, 22>
- <3, 14, 15>
- <3, 14, 18>
- <3, 18, 2>
- <3, 18, 25>
- <8, 12, 29>
- <11, 13, 28>
- <11, 20, 24>
- <13, 16, 28>
- <13, 16, 25>
- <13, 25, 28>
- <16, 25, 28>
- <18, 2, 25>
- <18, 25, 13>
- <20, 23, 22>
- <20, 23, 7>
- <20, 23, 11>
- <20, 23, 20>
- <20, 24, 11>
