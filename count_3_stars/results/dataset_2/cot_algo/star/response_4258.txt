Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (16, 24) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 24) (23, 24) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 9) (24, 16) (24, 15) (24, 23) (24, 14) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 12) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 29) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 25) (28, 22) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 5) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (25, 18) (25, 7) (25, 29) (25, 12) (25, 21) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 3) (21, 4) (21, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (0, 8) (0, 17) (14, 15) (14, 24) (14, 7) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 27) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 25) (12, 2) (9, 23) (9, 13) (9, 1) (6, 22) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 27) (29, 4) (29, 25) (19, 3) (19, 1) (27, 3) (27, 2) (27, 6) 

Response:
There are 13 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 15, 21, 27, 19
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 11, 8, 18, 21, 29
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 25, 6, 14, 2, 5
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 17, 26, 6
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 22, 17, 25, 2
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 26, 9, 1
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 3, 18, 14, 24
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 10, 0, 12
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 15, 4, 25
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 25
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 23, 6, 28, 12
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors: 24, 22, 8, 9
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors: 18, 7, 29, 21, 12

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (15, 21, 27)>
- Node 4 forms 14 3-stars: <4, (11, 8, 29)>, <4, (11, 8, 21)>, <4, (11, 18, 29)>, <4, (11, 18, 21)>, <4, (8, 18, 21)>, <4, (18, 21, 29)>, <4, (11, 8, 18)>, <4, (11, 21, 29)>, <4, (8, 18, 29)>, <4, (8, 21, 29)>, <4, (18, 21, 3)>, <4, (18, 21, 25)>, <4, (21, 25, 29)>, <4, (4, 21, 25)>
- Node 7 forms 5 3-stars: <7, (25, 6, 14)>, <7, (25, 2, 14)>, <7, (25, 2, 5)>, <7, (25, 2, 7)>, <7, (25, 5, 14)>
- Node 12 forms 4 3-stars: <12, (22, 17, 25)>, <12, (22, 17, 2)>, <12, (22, 25, 2)>, <12, (17, 25, 2)>
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star: <15, (3, 18, 24)>
- Node 25 forms 5 3-stars: <25, (18, 21, 29)>, <25, (7, 14, 2)>, <25, (7, 5, 2)>, <25, (7, 5, 14)>, <25, (7, 2, 14)>

Adding these up, we have a total of 30 3-stars: [30].
