Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 2) (15, 12) (27, 14) (27, 5) (27, 23) (5, 27) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 28) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 16) (2, 15) (2, 23) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 28) (18, 17) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 13) (28, 9) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 0) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 24) (17, 18) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 22) (24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 26) (26, 17) (26, 24) (4, 9) (4, 22) (4, 0) (22, 17) (22, 4) (22, 29) (11, 7) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (20, 1) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 10) (14, 27) (14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 19) (29, 22) (29, 0) (10, 2) (10, 8) (23, 27) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 16) (25, 5) (25, 6) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 13) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {28, 4, 29, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 20, 19, 12}
- Node 2: {15, 23, 10}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 16}
- Node 4: {9, 22, 0}
- Node 5: {27, 9, 25, 3}
- Node 6: {28, 25, 19, 13}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 0, 10}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 28, 7}
- Node 10: {2, 8}
- Node 11: {7}
- Node 12: {15, 1, 21, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 19}
- Node 14: {27, 12}
- Node 15: {2, 12}
- Node 16: {3, 18, 23}
- Node 17: {18, 24, 26, 22}
- Node 18: {16, 28, 17}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 13}
- Node 20: {1}
- Node 21: {28, 12, 23, 24}
- Node 22: {4, 17, 29}
- Node 23: {27, 2, 21, 16}
- Node 24: {21, 17, 26}
- Node 25: {5, 6}
- Node 26: {17, 24}
- Node 27: {14, 5, 23}
- Node 28: {9, 18, 6, 21, 0}
- Node 29: {22, 0}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: <2, (15, 23, 10)>
- Node 3: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: <5, (27, 9, 25)>
- Node 6: <6, (28, 25, 19)>
- Node 7: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 28)>
- Node 10: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: <12, (15, 1, 21)>
- Node 13: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 15: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 18: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 19: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 20: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: <21, (28, 12, 23)>
- Node 22: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 23: <23, (27, 2, 21)>
- Node 24: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 28: <28, (9, 18, 6)>
- Node 29: No 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the 3-stars, we get [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [7]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (15, 23, 10)>, 
<5, (27, 9, 25)>, 
<6, (28, 25, 19)>, 
<9, (5, 4, 28)>, 
<12, (15, 1, 21)>, 
<21, (28, 12, 23)>, 
<23, (27, 2, 21)>
