Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get:
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 46 \]

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, 1, 2, 3>
2. <0, 2, 3, 9>
3. <0, 3, 7, 9>
4. <0, 5, 7, 8>
5. <1, 2, 6, 9>
6. <1, 4, 7, 8>
7. <5, 6, 7, 8>
8. <7, 8, 9, 5>
9. <7, 9, 0, 3>
10. <7, 9, 6, 5>
