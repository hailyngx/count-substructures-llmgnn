Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by first determining the number of neighbors for each node. Then, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars associated with those nodes.

Let's first determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 2 neighbors
- Node 14: 5 neighbors

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \). 

So, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (5, 9, 10)>,
<6, (0, 7, 10)>,
<8, (1, 3, 14)>.
