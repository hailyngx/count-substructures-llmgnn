Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 10) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 7, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 6, 13}
- Node 11: {9, 12}
- Node 12: {5, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 6, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 8, 13, and 6 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 5 and 14 have 5 neighbors each.
- Node 4 and 9 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 2 and 3 have 4 neighbors each.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60

Therefore, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- <8, (0, 5, 13)>
- <13, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 5, 10)>
- <14, (1, 2, 9)>
