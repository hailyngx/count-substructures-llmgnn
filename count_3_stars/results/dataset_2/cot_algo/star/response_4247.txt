Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 19) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 16) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 4) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 30 \)

Thus, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 11, 13)>, <2, (7, 13, 19)>, <3, (0, 13, 19)>, <4, (1, 12, 4)>, <5, (9, 13, 15)>, <7, (2, 10, 16)>, <9, (1, 12, 13)>, <10, (7, 14, 18)>, <12, (3, 4, 9)>, <13, (2, 3, 19)>, <16, (7, 10, 18)>, <18, (10, 11, 16)>, <19, (2, 3, 8)>
