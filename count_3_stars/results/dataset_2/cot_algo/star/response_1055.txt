Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (18, 16) (18, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 1) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (14, 11) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 5) (17, 9) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 16) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 10) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with at least 3 neighbors, which are: 

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 0)
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 17), (9, 16), (9, 7)
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: (11, 7), (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 8)
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: (15, 8), (15, 19), (15, 5)
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: (19, 10), (19, 15), (19, 1)

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 6: 0 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: 0 3-star
- Node 19: 0 3-star

Summing these up gives a total of 14 3-stars in the graph, which we represent as [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 

<9, (6, 8, 16)>, <9, (6, 16, 17)>, <9, (1, 7, 19)>, <9, (8, 11, 7)>, <9, (8, 11, 16)>, <9, (8, 15, 19)>, <9, (11, 10, 14)>, <9, (11, 14, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 0)>, <11, (7, 10, 14)>
