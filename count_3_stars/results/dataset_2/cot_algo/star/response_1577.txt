Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 14) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 11) (18, 3) (18, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 7) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 15) (0, 6) (0, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 15, and 17.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 16.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 11.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 14, and 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 18.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 11, and 17.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 15, and 17.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 9, 14, and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 12, 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1 and 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 15, and 16.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8, and 16.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 11.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 14.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 11.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 7 and 17.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <11, (2, 5, 15)>, <11, (2, 5, 16)>, <11, (2, 15, 16)>, <11, (5, 15, 16)>.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <5, (1, 11, 17)>, <5, (1, 4, 17)>, <5, (1, 11, 4)>, <5, (4, 11, 17)>.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <7, (2, 3, 14)>, <7, (2, 3, 19)>, <7, (2, 14, 19)>, <7, (3, 14, 19)>, <7, (2, 9, 12)>, <7, (9, 12, 19)>, <7, (2, 12, 19)>, <7, (9, 12, 2)>, <7, (3, 9, 14)>, <7, (3, 9, 19)>.
 
The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 4 + 10 = 18. Therefore, the answer is [18].
