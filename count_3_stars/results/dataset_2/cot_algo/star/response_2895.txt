Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 4) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 12) (2, 19) (2, 9) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 29) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 10) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 21) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 14) (21, 20) (21, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (29, 18) (29, 8) (25, 0) (25, 1) (27, 26) (27, 5) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 15) (26, 16) (11, 0) (11, 1) (24, 10) (24, 20) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 19) (17, 4) (17, 22) (17, 3) (1, 25) (1, 11) (15, 4) (15, 22) (15, 18) (15, 26) (16, 26) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 13) (20, 21) (20, 24) (20, 3) (12, 23) (12, 28) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (8, 22) (8, 29) (8, 10) (10, 28) (10, 24) (10, 8) (5, 18) (5, 14) (5, 21) (5, 27) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {11, 19, 25, 9}
Node 1: {11, 25}
Node 2: {9, 19}
Node 3: {9, 17, 19, 20}
Node 4: {7, 15, 17}
Node 5: {18, 14, 21, 27}
Node 6: {22, 28, 19, 21}
Node 7: {4}
Node 8: {22, 29, 10}
Node 9: {0, 2, 3}
Node 10: {24, 8, 28}
Node 11: {0, 1}
Node 12: {13, 23, 28}
Node 13: {19, 12}
Node 14: {5, 21}
Node 15: {4, 22, 18, 26}
Node 16: {26}
Node 17: {4, 22, 3}
Node 18: {5, 15, 29}
Node 19: {0, 2, 6, 13, 3}
Node 20: {21, 3, 24}
Node 21: {6, 28, 5, 20, 14}
Node 22: {4, 15, 17, 8, 6, 23}
Node 23: {22, 26, 12}
Node 24: {10, 20}
Node 25: {0, 1}
Node 26: {22, 23, 15, 16}
Node 27: {5, 26}
Node 28: {6, 10, 21, 12}
Node 29: {18, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 19, 21, 26
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 5
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 22

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
Nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
Node with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 \times 3 + 10 \times 1 + 20 \times 1 = 52\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, (7, 15, 17)>
<5, (18, 21, 27)>
<19, (0, 2, 6)>
<21, (6, 28, 5)>
<22, (4, 15, 17)>
<26, (22, 23, 15)>
