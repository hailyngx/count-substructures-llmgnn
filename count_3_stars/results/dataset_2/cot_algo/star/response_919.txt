Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 3) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 18) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 11) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edge list:

1. Node 0: {14, 17, 18, 5}
2. Node 1: {9, 16, 10}
3. Node 2: {9, 8, 5}
4. Node 3: {14, 17, 10}
5. Node 4: {9, 12, 11, 15}
6. Node 5: {6, 7, 2, 0, 13}
7. Node 6: {9, 5}
8. Node 7: {9, 16, 5}
9. Node 8: {2, 19, 11}
10. Node 9: {6, 4, 2, 1, 7}
11. Node 10: {13, 1, 3}
12. Node 11: {8, 19, 4, 18}
13. Node 12: {4}
14. Node 13: {5, 10}
15. Node 14: {0, 3}
16. Node 15: {4}
17. Node 16: {7, 19, 1, 18}
18. Node 17: {0, 3}
19. Node 18: {0, 16, 11}
20. Node 19: {8, 11, 16}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 16, Node 18, Node 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].
