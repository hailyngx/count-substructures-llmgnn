Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 8) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (17, 4) (17, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
First, let's record the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 5, 8, 15
- Node 1: 6, 14
- Node 2: 5, 13, 15, 19
- Node 3: 5, 6, 9, 15
- Node 4: 7, 17
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 19
- Node 6: 1, 8, 15, 18
- Node 7: 4, 10, 17, 18, 19
- Node 8: 0, 6, 12, 15
- Node 9: 3, 12, 14, 15
- Node 10: 7
- Node 11: 16, 19
- Node 12: 8, 9, 17
- Node 13: 2, 14
- Node 14: 1, 9, 13, 16
- Node 15: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 16: 11, 14, 18, 19
- Node 17: 4, 7, 12
- Node 18: 6, 7, 16
- Node 19: 2, 5, 7, 11, 16

Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node and count the total:

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 78

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [78].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <2, (5, 15, 19)>
- <3, (5, 6, 15)>
- <5, (0, 2, 19)>
- <6, (8, 15, 18)>
- <8, (0, 6, 15)>
- <9, (3, 12, 15)>
- <12, (8, 9, 17)>
- <14, (1, 9, 13)>
- <16, (11, 14, 18)>
- <18, (6, 7, 16)>
- <19, (5, 7, 11)>
