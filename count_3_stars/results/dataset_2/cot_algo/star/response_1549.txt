Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 11) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (12, 13) (12, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a visual representation of the graph to better analyze the structure:

```
   1 -- 5 -- 6
    \    |    /
       3--9       
     / |  / | \
4 -- 7 -14--8-- 0 -- 10 --12
  \    |   |   |   |   |   /
    11 --13 2   --   --   --
```

Now let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 9, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 7, 13}
- Node 11: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 12: {0, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 5, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 102

Therefore, the final answer is [102].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (8, 10, 12)>, <3, (4, 9, 14)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 9, 14)>, <6, (7, 8, 11)>, <7, (9, 10, 13)>, <8, (4, 6, 13)>, <9, (5, 7, 11)>, <10, (0, 7, 13)>, <13, (7, 8, 10)>
