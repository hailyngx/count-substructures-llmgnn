Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 4) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 10) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 4) (23, 27) (23, 22) (6, 15) (6, 28) (9, 20) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 12) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 4) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 14) (21, 18) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 11) (21, 24) (24, 26) (24, 21) (7, 18) (1, 25) (1, 29) (1, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 25) (4, 19) (12, 28) (12, 21) (16, 3) (16, 29) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 13) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 1) (29, 1) (29, 16) (11, 19) (11, 21) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 5) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 25) (5, 17) (5, 20) (13, 14) (2, 27) (2, 17) (2, 14) (2, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: (27, 10, 4)
- Node 1: (25, 29, 10)
- Node 2: (27, 17, 14, 20)
- Node 3: (20, 16, 5)
- Node 4: (15, 0, 25, 19)
- Node 5: (15, 25, 17, 20, 3)
- Node 6: (15, 28)
- Node 7: (18)
- Node 9: (20)
- Node 10: (0, 18, 22, 1)
- Node 11: (19, 21)
- Node 12: (28, 21)
- Node 13: (14)
- Node 14: (26, 2, 13)
- Node 15: (6, 5, 4)
- Node 16: (3, 29)
- Node 17: (5, 2)
- Node 18: (22, 26, 10, 7, 21)
- Node 19: (27, 4, 26, 11)
- Node 20: (3, 9, 2, 5)
- Node 21: (28, 18, 12, 11, 24)
- Node 22: (27, 18, 23, 10)
- Node 23: (27, 22)
- Node 24: (26, 21)
- Node 25: (1, 5, 4)
- Node 26: (18, 28, 19, 24, 14)
- Node 27: (0, 22, 23, 2, 19)
- Node 28: (6, 21, 26, 12)

Next, we identify nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 3: <3, (5, 20, 16)>
- Node 15: <15, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 20: <20, (2, 3, 9)>
- Node 26: <26, (18, 19, 28)>
- Node 27: <27, (2, 19, 23)>

The total number of 3-stars is 5, so the final answer is [5].
