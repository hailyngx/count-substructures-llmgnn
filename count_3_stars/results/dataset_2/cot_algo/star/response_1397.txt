Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (13, 11) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, the number of neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 11, 16)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (5, 3, 19, 12)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (18, 19, 14, 17)
- Node 3: 3 neighbors (1, 14, 16)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (6, 16)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 11, 0)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (7, 4, 16)
- Node 7: 3 neighbors (6, 12, 16)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (9, 19, 10, 17)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (8)
- Node 10: 3 neighbors (8, 12, 19)
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (5, 13, 0, 14)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (1, 7, 10)
- Node 13: 1 neighbor (11)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (3, 2, 11)
- Node 15: 2 neighbors (17, 19)
- Node 16: 5 neighbors (3, 4, 18, 7, 0)
- Node 17: 4 neighbors (8, 2, 15, 19)
- Node 18: 2 neighbors (2, 16)
- Node 19: 5 neighbors (1, 8, 2, 10, 15)

We can see that the following nodes have three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19. 

For each of these nodes, we need to calculate the number of unique 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up all the unique 3-stars, we get: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 11>, <1, 3, 19>, <1, 3, 12>, <1, 19, 12>, <2, 18, 16>, <2, 18, 7>, <2, 19, 17>, <2, 19, 15>, <3, 14, 11>, <8, 19, 10>, <8, 19, 17>, <8, 19, 15>, <11, 13, 0>, <11, 13, 14>, <16, 18, 7>, <16, 18, 0>, <16, 7, 12>, <16, 7, 0>, <16, 0, 11>, <16, 0, 14>.
