Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 25) (14, 13) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (0, 27) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 3) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 26) (23, 0) (23, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 12) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 11) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 2) (28, 11) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 1) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 18) (26, 8) (26, 10) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 21) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 25) (10, 13) (10, 26) (10, 2) (24, 17) (24, 19) (24, 29) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 1) (19, 23) (19, 24) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (7, 14) (7, 20) (7, 5) (12, 20) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 29) (29, 22) (29, 24) (29, 12) (5, 21) (5, 7) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 21) (3, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {27, 23}
- Node 1: {4, 16, 12, 18}
- Node 2: {11, 4, 10}
- Node 3: {27}
- Node 4: {6, 27, 2, 1}
- Node 5: {21, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 4, 16}
- Node 7: {14, 20, 5}
- Node 8: {9, 25, 26}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 18}
- Node 10: {13, 26, 2}
- Node 11: {15, 28, 2}
- Node 12: {20, 1, 21, 29}
- Node 13: {22, 10, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 17, 7}
- Node 15: {22, 20, 11}
- Node 16: {17, 6, 1, 21}
- Node 17: {22, 14, 16, 24, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 9, 1}
- Node 19: {23, 24}
- Node 20: {15, 7, 12}
- Node 21: {16, 12, 5, 25}
- Node 22: {13, 15, 17, 29, 25}
- Node 23: {0, 27, 19}
- Node 24: {17, 19, 29}
- Node 25: {22, 8, 21}
- Node 26: {8, 10}
- Node 27: {0, 4, 3}
- Node 28: {11}
- Node 29: {22, 24, 12}

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and then calculate the number of 3-stars formed using \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 1: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star 

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the final answer is [41], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 18, 21>, <1, 18, 25>, <1, 21, 25>, <4, 12, 21>, <4, 12, 29>, <4, 21, 29>, <12, 21, 29>, <16, 1, 21>, <16, 1, 25>, <16, 21, 25>, <16, 17, 24>, <17, 14, 7>, <17, 18, 9>, <17, 18, 1>, <17, 18, 24>, <17, 1, 9>, <17, 1, 12>, <17, 1, 18>, <17, 1, 24>, <17, 9, 18>, <17, 9, 1>, <17, 9, 12>, <17, 9, 24>, <17, 12, 1>, <17, 12, 9>, <17, 12, 24>, <17, 18, 1>, <17, 18, 9>, <17, 18, 24>, <22, 13, 14>, <22, 13, 10>, <22, 13, 29>, <22, 14, 17>, <22, 14, 7>, <22, 17, 24>, <22, 17, 18>, <22, 17, 24>, <24, 19, 29>, <25, 8, 21>, <25, 8, 22>, <25, 21, 22>
