Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (2, 8) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 9) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (14, 1) (14, 18) (13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 5, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 1: neighbors {14, 17}
- Node 2: neighbors {8}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 12, 15}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 3, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 10}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 4, 12}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 16, 19}
- Node 9: neighbors {5, 9, 17, 18}
- Node 10: neighbors {3, 6, 12}
- Node 11: neighbors {0, 16, 18, 19}
- Node 12: neighbors {4, 7, 10, 15}
- Node 13: neighbors {0, 3, 19}
- Node 14: neighbors {1, 18}
- Node 15: neighbors {4, 12, 16}
- Node 16: neighbors {8, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 17: neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 18: neighbors {9, 11, 14}
- Node 19: neighbors {8, 11, 13, 16}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star

Therefore, a total of 9 unique 3-stars are formed. Thus, the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 13, 19)>
<3, (5, 10, 13)>
<4, (7, 12, 15)>
<5, (0, 9, 13)>
<8, (11, 16, 19)>
<9, (5, 17, 18)>
<11, (16, 18, 19)>
<12, (4, 10, 15)>
<16, (8, 15, 19)>
