Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 4, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: No 3-star formed (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: 1 3-star formed
- Node 2: 1 3-star formed
- Node 3: 1 3-star formed
- Node 4: 1 3-star formed
- Node 5: 1 3-star formed
- Node 6: 1 3-star formed
- Node 7: 1 3-star formed
- Node 8: No 3-star formed (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 1 3-star formed

Total number of 3-stars = 8

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 4, 7>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 3, 7>
<2, 5, 7>
<3, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 7>
<5, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
