Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {7, 4, 1, 10}
Node 1: {9, 13, 0}
Node 2: {8, 12, 3}
Node 3: {8, 13, 2, 11, 6}
Node 4: {5, 12, 0, 11, 6}
Node 5: {9, 4, 7}
Node 6: {3, 4, 10}
Node 7: {5, 0, 14}
Node 8: {9, 13, 2, 14, 10, 3}
Node 9: {5, 8, 1, 12}
Node 10: {8, 12, 0, 6}
Node 11: {14, 3, 4}
Node 12: {9, 4, 2, 10, 14}
Node 13: {8, 1, 3}
Node 14: {8, 13, 7, 12, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3, Node 4, and Node 8 have 6 neighbors each, so they can each form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, and Node 14 have fewer than 3 neighbors and cannot form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 3 \times 20 + 10 = 74 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [74], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 10)>, <3, (6, 11, 13)>, <4, (6, 11, 12)>, <8, (3, 14, 10)>.
