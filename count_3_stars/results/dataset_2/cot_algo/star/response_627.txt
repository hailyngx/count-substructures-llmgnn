Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 9, 8, 3, 1}
- Node 1: {9, 6, 0, 7}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 6, 8, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {2, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 1}
- Node 8: {6, 4, 2, 0, 3}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 1, 0}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  Total 3-stars: 5 * 10 = 50
  
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 9, 8)>, <0, (5, 9, 3)>, <0, (5, 8, 3)>, <0, (9, 8, 3)>, <0, (9, 1, 8)>, 
<4, (9, 6, 8)>, <4, (9, 8, 3)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (6, 2, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 3)>,
<6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 8, 3)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 8, 3)>,
<8, (6, 4, 2)>, <8, (6, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 8, 3)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>,
<9, (6, 1, 0)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 0, 7)>, <9, (1, 0, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 2)>
