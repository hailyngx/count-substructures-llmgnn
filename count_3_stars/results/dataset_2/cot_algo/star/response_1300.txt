The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 0) (1, 29) (1, 19) (21, 13) (21, 6) (21, 16) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 15) (7, 19) (7, 27) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 15) (6, 21) (6, 2) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 20) (12, 27) (27, 7) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 28) (27, 16) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 10) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 15) (15, 4) (15, 25) (15, 18) (15, 20) (15, 26) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 0) (20, 19) (5, 8) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 8) (26, 13) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 15) (26, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 23) (23, 8) (23, 14) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 29) (17, 13) (17, 3) (10, 2) (10, 26) (16, 21) (16, 27) (16, 2) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 11) (29, 1) (29, 11) (28, 27) (28, 0) (14, 23) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 20) 

Response:
The graph has the following properties:
- 30 nodes
- 90 edges

Let's first find the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: {22, 20, 28, 24, 8}
2. Node 1: {29, 19}
3. Node 2: {6, 18, 16, 10}
4. Node 3: {25, 11, 17, 26}
5. Node 4: {22, 18, 15}
6. Node 5: {8}
7. Node 6: {21, 2}
8. Node 7: {19, 27}
9. Node 8: {9, 5, 0, 23}
10. Node 9: {25, 8, 20}
11. Node 10: {2, 26}
12. Node 11: {3, 24, 29}
13. Node 12: {27}
14. Node 13: {22, 26, 17, 21}
15. Node 14: {23}
16. Node 15: {25, 4, 18, 20, 26}
17. Node 16: {2, 21, 27}
18. Node 17: {13, 3}
19. Node 18: {4, 2, 15}
20. Node 19: {1, 7, 20}
21. Node 20: {9, 15, 0, 19}
22. Node 21: {13, 6, 16}
23. Node 22: {13, 4, 0}
24. Node 23: {8, 14}
25. Node 24: {27, 0, 11}
26. Node 25: {3, 9, 15, 26}
27. Node 26: {13, 3, 25, 15, 10}
28. Node 27: {7, 12, 16, 24, 28}
29. Node 28: {27, 0}
30. Node 29: {1, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 8, 20>, <0, 8, 23>, <0, 20, 28>, <0, 24, 27>, <2, 10, 26>, <2, 16, 27>, <2, 18, 4>, <2, 6, 21>, 
<3, 17, 13>, <3, 26, 13>, <3, 25, 9>, <3, 25, 15>, <4, 15, 25>, <7, 19, 20>, <15, 20, 0>, <15, 25, 26>, 
<16, 2, 21>, <16, 27, 24>, <16, 27, 28>, <21, 16, 27>, <22, 0, 28>, <22, 4, 18>, <22, 13, 21>, <24, 0, 11>, 
<26, 10, 2>, <26, 13, 17>, <26, 13, 21>, <26, 15, 4>, <26, 15, 25>, <27, 12, 7>, <27, 16, 2>, <27, 16, 21>
