Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 9) (0, 4) (0, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 --- 4 --- 9 --- 1 --- 17
|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |
17    7     10    9     0
|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |
1 --- 17 --- 0 --- 16 --- 8
|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |
7     19    11    18    6
|     |     |     |     |
|     |     |     |     |
4 --- 13 --- 3 --- 15 --- 12
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 17}
- Node 1: Neighbors {17, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {13, 6, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {13, 15}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {11, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 17, 19}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 12, 16}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4, 10, 15}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 11, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 10, 18}
- Node 12: Neighbors {6, 8, 15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 12, 18}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 9, 12}
- Node 16: Neighbors {8, 10, 18}
- Node 17: Neighbors {0, 1, 7}
- Node 18: Neighbors {11, 13, 16}
- Node 19: Neighbors {5, 7}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star (<4, 0, 9>)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (<6, 4, 13>)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars
- Node 9: 0 3-stars
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 12: 0 3-stars
- Node 13: 1 3-star (<13, 4, 6>)
- Node 16: 1 3-star (<16, 8, 10>)
- Node 17: 0 3-stars
- Node 18: 0 3-stars
- Node 19: 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [3] 

Unique 3-stars:
<4, 0, 9>
<6, 4, 13>
<16, 8, 10>
