Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 10) (0, 8) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 7) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 16) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (12, 15) (12, 18) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 14) (4, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 3, 15, 10, 8
- Node 2: 8, 5
- Node 3: 15, 0, 14, 19, 5
- Node 4: 14, 6
- Node 5: 3, 15, 2, 18, 7
- Node 6: 13, 7, 4
- Node 7: 8, 5, 6
- Node 8: 17, 2, 19, 0, 7
- Node 9: 10, 14, 16
- Node 10: 11, 0, 9
- Node 11: 10, 13
- Node 12: 15, 18
- Node 13: 11, 17, 6
- Node 14: 3, 9, 4, 16
- Node 15: 3, 0, 5, 12
- Node 16: 14, 9
- Node 17: 13, 8, 18
- Node 18: 17, 5, 12
- Node 19: 3, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 0, and 5 <3, (15, 0, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 0, and 19 <8, (17, 0, 19)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 16 <14, (9, 4, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
