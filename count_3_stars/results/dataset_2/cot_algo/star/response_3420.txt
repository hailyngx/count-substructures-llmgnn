Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 7) (22, 25) (22, 17) (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 6) (14, 17) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 20) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 27) (3, 2) (25, 22) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 15) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 8) (21, 9) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 15) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 18) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (27, 3) (16, 13) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 19) (20, 17) (20, 24) (12, 4) (5, 28) (5, 24) (5, 15) (1, 11) (11, 1) (24, 3) (24, 29) (24, 20) (24, 5) (18, 13) (18, 29) (18, 23) (23, 21) (23, 18) (23, 2) (6, 26) (6, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 23) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 15) (15, 25) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 8) (19, 16) (19, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

0: 4, 8, 22
1: 11
2: 3, 9, 10, 23
3: 2, 24, 25, 27
4: 0, 12
5: 15, 24, 28
6: 19, 26
7: 8, 10, 21, 22
8: 0, 7, 15, 16
9: 2, 9, 21, 26
10: 2, 7
11: 1
12: 4
13: 16, 17, 18, 22
14: 17
15: 5, 8, 21, 25
16: 8, 13, 19, 28
17: 13, 14, 20, 22, 29
18: 13, 18, 23, 29
19: 6, 16
20: 17, 24
21: 7, 9, 15, 23
22: 7, 13, 17, 22, 25
23: 2, 18, 21
24: 3, 5, 20, 24, 29
25: 3, 15, 22, 25
26: 6, 9, 26, 28
27: 3
28: 5, 16, 26
29: 17, 18, 24

Based on the neighbor sets, we can see that nodes 13, 17, 22, 24, and 25 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:

\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 38 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 38. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<13, 16, 17, 18>, <13, 16, 17, 22>, <13, 16, 18, 22>, <13, 17, 18, 22>, <16, 17, 18, 22>, <13, 17, 22, 29>, <16, 17, 22, 28>, <17, 22, 24, 25>, <13, 22, 24, 25>, <15, 21, 24, 25>, <3, 15, 24, 25>, <5, 15, 24, 25>, <13, 16, 17, 29>, <8, 15, 24, 25>, <13, 17, 20, 22>, <17, 20, 24, 29>, <7, 21, 23, 24>, <2, 15, 23, 24>, <18, 23, 24, 29>, <2, 21, 23, 29>.
