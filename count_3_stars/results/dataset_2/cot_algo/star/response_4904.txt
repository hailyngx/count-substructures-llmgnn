Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 1) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (7, 10) (7, 16) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 19) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 16) (5, 2) (9, 3) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 15, 17
Node 1: 0, 3, 8, 13, 15
Node 2: 5, 6, 15, 17
Node 3: 1, 9, 10, 12
Node 4: 0, 12, 13
Node 5: 2, 6, 16
Node 6: 0, 2, 5, 18
Node 7: 10, 16
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 3
Node 10: 3, 7, 11, 17
Node 11: 10, 18, 19
Node 12: 3, 4, 19
Node 13: 1, 4, 18
Node 15: 0, 1, 2
Node 16: 5, 7, 19
Node 17: 0, 2, 10
Node 18: 6, 11, 13, 19
Node 19: 11, 12, 16, 18

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of them:

Node 0: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
Node 1: 5 neighbors -> \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
Node 2: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
Node 3: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
Node 4: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star formed
Node 6: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
Node 10: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
Node 12: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star formed
Node 13: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star formed
Node 15: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star formed
Node 16: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star formed
Node 17: 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star formed
Node 18: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed
Node 19: 4 neighbors -> \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 15>, <0, 1, 17>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 15, 2>, <0, 15, 17>, <0, 15, 6>, <0, 4, 6>, <1, 3, 10>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 8, 3>, <1, 13, 18>, <2, 6, 17>, <2, 5, 6>, <2, 5, 16>, <2, 6, 0>, <3, 9, 12>, <10, 7, 16>, <10, 11, 18>, <10, 17, 2>, <12, 4, 19>, <13, 18, 11>, <16, 19, 11>.
