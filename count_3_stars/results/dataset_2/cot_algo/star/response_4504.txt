Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 12) (9, 26) (9, 25) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 8) (18, 22) (18, 21) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 25) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 2) (8, 26) (8, 23) (8, 6) (23, 26) (23, 8) (23, 25) (4, 21) (4, 1) (4, 2) (0, 17) (0, 1) (7, 6) (5, 19) (5, 29) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 12) (20, 29) (20, 3) (29, 5) (29, 20) (29, 12) (3, 20) (3, 24) (21, 18) (21, 4) (21, 16) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 24) (14, 2) (16, 21) (28, 17) (28, 12) (25, 13) (25, 9) (25, 11) (25, 23) (25, 2) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 15) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 27) (15, 5) (15, 24) (15, 6) (15, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 27) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 25) (2, 15) (12, 22) (12, 19) (12, 29) (12, 28) (27, 13) (27, 6) (27, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 27}
- Node 2: {4, 14, 15, 17, 25}
- Node 3: {20, 24}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 21}
- Node 5: {14, 15, 19, 29}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 15, 27}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {6, 23, 26}
- Node 9: {25, 26}
- Node 10: {11, 17}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 19, 25}
- Node 12: {19, 22, 28, 29}
- Node 13: {22, 25, 27}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 11, 24}
- Node 15: {5, 6, 14, 24}
- Node 16: {21}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 10, 28}
- Node 18: {21, 22}
- Node 19: {5, 11, 12}
- Node 20: {3, 29}
- Node 21: {4, 16, 18}
- Node 22: {12, 13, 18}
- Node 23: {8, 25, 26}
- Node 24: {3, 14, 15}
- Node 25: {2, 11, 13, 23}
- Node 26: {8, 9, 23}
- Node 27: {1, 6, 13}
- Node 28: {10, 12, 17}
- Node 29: {5, 12, 20}

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 11, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 17, Node 19, Node 21, Node 22, Node 23, Node 25, Node 26, Node 28, Node 29

Next, we calculate the number of unique 3-stars for each of these nodes:
\[ \text{Number of unique 3-stars} = \binom{n}{3} \]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes gives the answer. 

Let's now calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

\[ \binom{18}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{6}{3} = 456 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [456].
