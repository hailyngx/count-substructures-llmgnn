Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 6}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 7, 3, 14, 12}
- Node 2: {9, 8, 13, 11}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 11, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 12, 0}
- Node 5: {8, 1, 4, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {13, 11, 0, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 1}
- Node 8: {5, 3, 13, 2, 10}
- Node 9: {2, 1, 13}
- Node 10: {7, 8, 13, 12, 0}
- Node 11: {3, 2, 6}
- Node 12: {4, 1, 10}
- Node 13: {9, 8, 2, 10, 6}
- Node 14: {5, 1, 6}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars: nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 13. 

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors. 

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 65

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [65].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 5, 14>
<1, 3, 11>
<1, 12, 14>
<1, 7, 10>
<1, 7, 12>
<1, 9, 13>
<1, 5, 14>
<5, 8, 3>
<5, 8, 13>
<5, 3, 11>
<5, 14, 6>
<6, 0, 14>
<6, 11, 13>
<10, 7, 8>
<10, 7, 0>
<13, 8, 2>
