Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 16) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 29) (23, 19) (23, 15) (23, 29) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 29) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 7) (2, 9) (2, 12) (21, 4) (21, 28) (21, 19) (28, 17) (28, 21) (28, 5) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 5) (20, 17) (20, 3) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 7) (19, 23) (19, 21) (18, 17) (18, 26) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 7) (12, 2) (12, 29) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 25) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 1) (29, 12) (25, 14) (25, 9) (25, 24) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 24) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 24) (27, 10) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {22, 8, 24}
- Node 1: {26, 15, 29}
- Node 2: {9, 12}
- Node 3: {14, 20, 24}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 16, 21}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 28}
- Node 6: {9, 7}
- Node 7: {6, 26, 5, 10, 16}
- Node 8: {4, 10, 0}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 25, 16}
- Node 10: {8, 15, 7, 27}
- Node 11: {22, 15, 24}
- Node 12: {2, 29}
- Node 13: {4, 5}
- Node 14: {3, 17, 25}
- Node 15: {11, 1, 10, 23}
- Node 16: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 17: {14, 20, 28, 18}
- Node 18: {17, 26}
- Node 19: {23, 21}
- Node 20: {17, 3}
- Node 21: {4, 19, 28}
- Node 22: {11, 0, 29}
- Node 23: {19, 15, 29}
- Node 24: {11, 3, 25, 0}
- Node 25: {9, 14, 24}
- Node 26: {1, 18, 7}
- Node 27: {10}
- Node 28: {17, 21, 5}
- Node 29: {22, 1, 12, 23}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 1 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 2 forms [0] 3-stars
- Node 3 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 4 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 5 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 6 forms [0] 3-stars
- Node 7 forms [3] 3-stars: <7, (6, 16, 26)>, <7, (5, 10, 28)>, <7, (16, 4, 8)>
- Node 8 forms [0] 3-stars
- Node 9 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 10 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 11 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 12 forms [0] 3-stars
- Node 13 forms [0] 3-stars
- Node 14 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 15 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 16 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 17 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 18 forms [0] 3-stars
- Node 19 forms [0] 3-stars
- Node 20 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 21 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 22 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 23 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 24 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 25 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 26 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 27 forms [0] 3-stars
- Node 28 forms [1] 3-star
- Node 29 forms [0] 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get a total of [17] 3-stars.
