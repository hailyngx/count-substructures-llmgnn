Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 26) (29, 24) (29, 11) (3, 7) (25, 6) (25, 15) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 20) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 15) (12, 1) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 17) (15, 25) (15, 12) (15, 20) (15, 16) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 14) (20, 16) (9, 22) (9, 7) (22, 9) (22, 14) (26, 29) (26, 13) (26, 21) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 19) (21, 26) (21, 17) (21, 24) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 28) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 16) (10, 6) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 18) (7, 3) (7, 27) (7, 9) (23, 5) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 18) (14, 20) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 11) (24, 29) (24, 27) (24, 21) (24, 17) (28, 2) (28, 12) (28, 5) (17, 27) (17, 21) (17, 24) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 20) (16, 19) (16, 14) (11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {18}
- Node 1: {4, 12, 18}
- Node 2: {28, 29}
- Node 3: {7}
- Node 4: {1, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {19, 23, 28}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 19, 25}
- Node 7: {3, 9, 27}
- Node 8: {11, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 9: {7, 22}
- Node 10: {6}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 18, 29}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 15, 27, 28}
- Node 13: {8, 20, 26}
- Node 14: {4, 16, 20, 22}
- Node 15: {12, 16, 20, 25}
- Node 16: {8, 14, 15, 19, 20}
- Node 17: {21, 24, 27}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 11}
- Node 19: {5, 6, 16}
- Node 20: {13, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 21: {17, 24, 26}
- Node 22: {9, 14}
- Node 23: {5}
- Node 24: {17, 21, 27, 29}
- Node 25: {6, 15}
- Node 26: {13, 21, 29}
- Node 27: {7, 12, 17, 24}
- Node 28: {2, 5, 12}
- Node 29: {2, 11, 24, 26}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars using the inom{n}{3} formula for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total: 1
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total: 2
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total: 3
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total: 7
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total: 11
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total: 15
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. Total: 25
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total: 26
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total: 30
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total: 34
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars. Total: 44
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total: 45
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total: 49
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total: 50
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total: 54
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total: 58
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. Total: 59
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars. Total: 63

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [63].
