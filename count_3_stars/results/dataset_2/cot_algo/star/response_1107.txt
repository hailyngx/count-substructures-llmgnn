Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 4
- Node 1: 5, 6, 8, 7
- Node 2: 5, 6, 4, 3
- Node 3: 5, 6, 2
- Node 4: 9, 8, 0, 2
- Node 5: 9, 2, 1, 0, 3
- Node 6: 1, 7, 3, 2, 8
- Node 7: 9, 6, 8, 1
- Node 8: 9, 6, 4, 1, 7
- Node 9: 5, 8, 4, 7

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed with those nodes:

- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46, which is represented as [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 4)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <6, (1, 7, 3)>, <8, (9, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>.
