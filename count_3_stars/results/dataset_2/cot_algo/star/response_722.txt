Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (2, 10) (2, 13) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 19) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 9) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (1, 19) (1, 12) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
The task is to identify all the 3-star configurations in this graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges. 

Let's first find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 8, 9, 15
- Node 1: 12, 19
- Node 2: 6, 10, 13
- Node 3: 0, 12, 17
- Node 4: 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 4, 15, 18
- Node 6: 2, 7, 10, 12
- Node 7: 6, 9, 14
- Node 8: 0, 4, 12, 18
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7
- Node 10: 2, 6, 11
- Node 11: 10, 13, 14
- Node 12: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 13: 2, 11, 16
- Node 14: 7, 11, 19
- Node 15: 0, 5
- Node 16: 13, 17, 19
- Node 17: 3, 16, 19
- Node 18: 5, 8
- Node 19: 1, 14, 16, 17

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 8, 12, 19

Number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 2 3-stars
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
Therefore, we have a total of [5] unique 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 8, 12>
- <0, 8, 9>
- <0, 8, 15>
- <0, 9, 15>
- <8, 12, 18>
