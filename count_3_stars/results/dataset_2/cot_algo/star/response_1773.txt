Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 5) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 18) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (6, 13) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 12) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 5) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 16) (0, 2) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 16) (9, 14) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that act as centers. Since a 3-star graph has a center node with exactly 3 neighbors, we can identify the center nodes from the given edges:

- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 8, 13, 15
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 7, 16
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 5, 17, 19
- Node 14 has neighbors: 10, 11, 15

We notice that Node 3, Node 4, and Node 7 have 3 or more neighbors, making them potential center nodes for 3-star graphs. Therefore, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formable around these nodes.

Calculating for Node 3:
Node 3 can form a 3-star with its 3 neighbors: (1, 3, 8), (1, 3, 13), (1, 3, 15), (8, 3, 13), (8, 3, 15), (13, 3, 15)
In total, there are 6 unique 3-stars around Node 3.

Calculating for Node 4:
Node 4 can form a 3-star with its 3 neighbors: (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 16), (7, 4, 16)
In total, there are 3 unique 3-stars around Node 4.

Calculating for Node 7:
Node 7 can form a 3-star with its 3 neighbors: (4, 7, 17), (4, 7, 19), (17, 7, 19)
In total, there are 3 unique 3-stars around Node 7.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6 + 3 + 3] = [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 3, 8>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 15>, 
<4, 7, 17>, <4, 7, 19>, 
<7, 17, 19>.
