Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {5, 9, 14, 1, 2}
- Node 1: neighbors {9, 4, 10, 0, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {5, 7, 12, 0, 3}
- Node 3: neighbors {10, 2}
- Node 4: neighbors {7, 8, 1, 11}
- Node 5: neighbors {2, 11, 0}
- Node 6: neighbors {8, 13, 10, 1}
- Node 7: neighbors {4, 12, 2, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 7, 13, 6}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 0}
- Node 10: neighbors {13, 11, 3, 6, 1, 14}
- Node 11: neighbors {5, 4, 10, 12}
- Node 12: neighbors {7, 13, 11, 2, 14}
- Node 13: neighbors {8, 12, 10, 6}
- Node 14: neighbors {10, 12, 0}

Next, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: \( 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 82 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [82].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <1, 6, 10>
- <1, 6, 13>
- <1, 6, 4>
- <1, 10, 12>
- <1, 10, 14>
- <1, 10, 4>
- <1, 10, 6>
- <2, 0, 5>
- <2, 0, 12>
- <2, 3, 10>
- <2, 3, 12>
- <4, 11, 5>
- <4, 11, 7>
- <4, 12, 11>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <6, 13, 8>
- <7, 12, 11>
- <7, 12, 2>
- <8, 13, 6>
- <10, 11, 12>
- <10, 11, 3>
- <10, 12, 14>
- <10, 13, 6>
- <10, 14, 12>
