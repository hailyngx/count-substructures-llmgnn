Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 3) (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 2) (1, 9) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 9) (18, 22) (18, 19) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 14) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 20) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (5, 26) (5, 23) (19, 18) (19, 25) (19, 28) (19, 23) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 23) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 15) (25, 19) (25, 15) (10, 21) (10, 26) (26, 5) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 27) (6, 16) (6, 29) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 27) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 19) (23, 20) (23, 24) (12, 11) (12, 0) (15, 29) (15, 25) (15, 26) (15, 24) (28, 22) (28, 0) (28, 19) (9, 1) (9, 21) (9, 20) (9, 24) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 17) (3, 22) (3, 20) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 15) (24, 9) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: 16, 28, 12
Node 1 neighbors: 21, 29, 2, 9
Node 2 neighbors: 1, 20
Node 3 neighbors: 22, 20
Node 4 neighbors: 13, 8, 23, 14
Node 5 neighbors: 26, 23
Node 6 neighbors: 16, 29, 17
Node 8 neighbors: 4
Node 9 neighbors: 1, 21, 20, 24
Node 10 neighbors: 21, 26
Node 11 neighbors: 16, 14, 12
Node 12 neighbors: 11, 0
Node 13 neighbors: 22, 4
Node 14 neighbors: 11, 4
Node 15 neighbors: 29, 25, 26, 24
Node 16 neighbors: 0, 11, 6
Node 17 neighbors: 6, 27
Node 18 neighbors: 22, 19
Node 19 neighbors: 18, 25, 28, 23
Node 20 neighbors: 2, 29, 3, 9, 23
Node 21 neighbors: 1, 10, 27, 9
Node 22 neighbors: 13, 18, 28, 3, 24
Node 23 neighbors: 4, 5, 19, 20, 24
Node 24 neighbors: 22, 23, 15, 9
Node 25 neighbors: 19, 15
Node 26 neighbors: 5, 10, 15, 27
Node 27 neighbors: 21, 26, 17
Node 28 neighbors: 22, 19, 0
Node 29 neighbors: 1, 20, 6, 15

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 9 and Node 24 have 4 neighbors, so each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \), which can be represented as [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<9, (1, 21, 24)>
<9, (1, 20, 24)>
<9, (21, 27, 24)>
<9, (21, 20, 24)>
<24, (22, 23, 15)>
<24, (22, 19, 15)>
<24, (23, 20, 15)>
<24, (22, 20, 15)>
<15, (29, 26, 24)>
<15, (29, 25, 24)>
<15, (26, 27, 24)>
<15, (29, 20, 24)>
