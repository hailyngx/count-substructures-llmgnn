Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9}
Node 1: {0, 4, 6, 7}
Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 7}
Node 3: {0, 4, 9}
Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 7}
Node 5: {6, 7, 8}
Node 6: {1, 2, 5, 9}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5, 9}
Node 8: {0, 5, 9}
Node 9: {0, 6, 7, 8}

Using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula, we find the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 3: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: No 3-stars (Less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 6) + 10 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 9) = 32

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are:
