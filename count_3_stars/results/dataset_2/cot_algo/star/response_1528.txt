Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 22) (18, 22) (18, 7) (22, 16) (22, 18) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 0) (3, 25) (3, 6) (23, 1) (23, 21) (10, 11) (10, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 28) (5, 14) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 7) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 21) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 0) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 28) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 29) (9, 24) (9, 1) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 9) (29, 4) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 4) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 9) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 27) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 8) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 24) (15, 28) (21, 23) (21, 0) (24, 17) (24, 9) (24, 15) (28, 5) (28, 19) (28, 15) (27, 17) (27, 26) (27, 6) (14, 5) (14, 15) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 26) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

For each node, let's determine its neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {25, 8, 7, 21}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {25, 23, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {8, 9, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {25, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 26, 29}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {10, 19, 28, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {3, 26, 27}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {18, 17, 0}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 0, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {11, 2, 29, 24, 1}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {11, 5}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {16, 10, 9, 29}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {16, 20, 8}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {5, 15}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {19, 14, 24, 28}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {11, 12, 22}
- Node 17: Neighbors = {20, 24, 27, 7}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {22, 7}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {5, 15, 28}
- Node 20: Neighbors = {25, 17, 12}
- Node 21: Neighbors = {23, 0}
- Node 22: Neighbors = {16, 18}
- Node 23: Neighbors = {1, 21}
- Node 24: Neighbors = {17, 9, 15}
- Node 25: Neighbors = {20, 3, 1, 29, 0}
- Node 26: Neighbors = {6, 27, 4}
- Node 27: Neighbors = {17, 26, 6}
- Node 28: Neighbors = {5, 19, 15}
- Node 29: Neighbors = {25, 11, 9, 4}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes 11 and 16 each have exactly 3 neighbors, so they each form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 2 (from nodes 11 and 16) + 10 (from node 25) + 10 (from node 9) = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (16, 10, 9)>
<16, (11, 12, 22)>
<25, (20, 1, 0)>
<25, (3, 1, 0)>
<25, (3, 29, 0)>
<25, (6, 27, 0)>
<25, (3, 6, 27)>
<25, (1, 9, 29)>
<25, (1, 9, 4)>
<25, (29, 9, 4)>
<9, (11, 29, 4)>
<9, (2, 29, 4)>
<9, (2, 24, 1)>
<9, (2, 24, 15)>
<9, (29, 4, 26)>
