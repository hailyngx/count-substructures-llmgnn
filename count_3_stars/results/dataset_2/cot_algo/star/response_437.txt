Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) 

Response:
The nodes are connected in the following way:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 14
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 1, 11
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 14, 6, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 8, 6, 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 2, 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, 14
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 10, 11, 12, 0
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 10
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 4, 0
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 7, 12, 11, 13
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 13, 2, 10, 12, 7
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 10, 11
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 10, 11, 14
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 0, 13

From this information, we can determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Calculating for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 1: 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 2: 4 neighbors, so can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 3: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star. 
- Node 4: 5 neighbors, so can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 5: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star.
- Node 6: 4 neighbors, so can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 7: 5 neighbors, so can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 8: 4 neighbors, so can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 9: 3 neighbors, so no 3-star. 
- Node 10: 5 neighbors, so can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 11: 5 neighbors, so can form 2 3-stars.
- Node 12: 4 neighbors, so can form 1 3-star. 
- Node 13: 5 neighbors, so can form 2 3-stars. 
- Node 14: 4 neighbors, so can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (5, 8, 13)>
<4, (7, 8, 10)>
<4, (7, 8, 11)>
<6, (3, 6, 14)>
<7, (4, 7, 10)>
<7, (4, 7, 11)>
<10, (8, 10, 13)>
<10, (8, 10, 11)>
<11, (10, 11, 13)>
<11, (10, 11, 12)>
<12, (7, 12, 3)>
<13, (11, 13, 14)>
