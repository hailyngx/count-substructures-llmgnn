Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 16) (6, 22) (6, 19) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 20) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 19) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 13) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 8) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 26) (2, 1) (8, 27) (8, 25) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 28) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 12) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 25) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 24) (23, 14) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 24) (16, 21) (16, 7) (16, 29) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 26) (22, 6) (7, 27) (7, 16) (10, 3) (10, 23) (10, 26) (26, 0) (26, 4) (26, 10) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 16) (29, 4) (20, 1) (20, 9) (20, 13) (20, 5) (5, 20) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 23) (24, 27) (24, 3) (24, 13) (24, 23) (12, 28) (12, 25) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {14, 26, 29}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 20, 21}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {10, 11, 24}
- Node 4: {1, 26, 29}
- Node 5: {20}
- Node 6: {19, 22}
- Node 7: {16, 27}
- Node 8: {25, 27}
- Node 9: {17, 20, 28}
- Node 10: {3, 23, 26}
- Node 11: {3, 18, 23, 25}
- Node 12: {25, 28}
- Node 13: {17, 20, 24}
- Node 14: {0, 17, 18, 19, 23}
- Node 15: {27}
- Node 16: {7, 21, 29}
- Node 17: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 18: {11, 14, 23}
- Node 19: {6, 14, 28}
- Node 20: {1, 5, 9, 13}
- Node 21: {1, 16}
- Node 22: {6}
- Node 23: {10, 11, 14, 18, 24}
- Node 24: {3, 13, 23, 27}
- Node 25: {0, 8, 11, 12}
- Node 26: {0, 4, 10}
- Node 27: {7, 8, 15, 24}
- Node 28: {9, 12, 19}
- Node 29: {0, 4, 16}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form a 3-star: 1, 4, 14, 17, 20, 23, 25, 27, and 29.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 1: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 14: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 17: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star
- Node 20: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 23: 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 25: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 27: 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 29: 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 2, 4, 20>
- <14, 0, 26, 29>
- <17, 9, 13, 20>
- <23, 10, 11, 25>
- <25, 0, 8, 11>
