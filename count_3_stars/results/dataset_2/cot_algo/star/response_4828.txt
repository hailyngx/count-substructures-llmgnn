Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 8) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (5, 17) (5, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 0) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 16) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 4) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 3) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (1, 2) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 15) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 16}
- Node 1: {2, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {17, 18}
- Node 4: {10, 11}
- Node 5: {7, 17}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 15}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 10}
- Node 8: {6, 11, 12, 19}
- Node 9: {11, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 10: {4, 7, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 13: {2, 12, 17}
- Node 14: {0}
- Node 15: {6, 9, 12, 19}
- Node 16: {0, 17}
- Node 17: {3, 5, 7, 13, 16}
- Node 18: {3, 9, 12}
- Node 19: {8, 10, 15}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15, and 17 have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 37 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [37], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <6, (7, 8, 15)>
- <8, (6, 11, 12)>
- <9, (11, 15, 18)>
- <11, (1, 4, 8)>
- <12, (8, 13, 15)>
- <15, (6, 9, 12, 19)>
- <17, (3, 7, 13, 16)>
