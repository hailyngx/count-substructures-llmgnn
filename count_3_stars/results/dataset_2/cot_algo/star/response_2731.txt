Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (17, 29) (17, 21) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 14) (6, 18) (6, 29) (6, 21) (6, 14) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 19) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (26, 5) (24, 15) (24, 21) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 27) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 9) (1, 2) (1, 25) (15, 24) (15, 25) (8, 22) (8, 19) (8, 27) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 9) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (5, 26) (5, 10) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 12) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 20) (12, 28) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 20) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 11) (23, 25) (23, 10) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 16) (25, 23) (9, 21) (9, 19) (9, 14) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 2) (27, 20) (11, 13) (11, 20) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {12, 16}
- Node 1: {2, 25}
- Node 2: {1, 20, 27}
- Node 3: {4, 12, 20}
- Node 4: {3, 13}
- Node 5: {10, 26}
- Node 6: {14, 18, 21, 29}
- Node 7: {13, 17, 21, 27}
- Node 8: {19, 22, 27}
- Node 9: {14, 19, 21}
- Node 10: {16, 23, 5}
- Node 11: {13, 20}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 20, 28}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {6, 9, 29}
- Node 15: {24, 25}
- Node 16: {0, 10, 25}
- Node 17: {7, 21, 29}
- Node 18: {6, 22}
- Node 19: {8, 9, 28}
- Node 20: {2, 3, 11, 12, 27}
- Node 21: {6, 7, 9, 17, 24}
- Node 22: {8, 18, 28}
- Node 23: {10, 25}
- Node 24: {15, 21}
- Node 25: {1, 15, 16, 23, 29}
- Node 26: {5}
- Node 27: {2, 7, 8, 20}
- Node 28: {12, 19, 22}
- Node 29: {6, 17, 25}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 20, 21, 25, and 27 have 3 or more neighbors.

Using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 52 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (1, 20, 27)>
- <3, (4, 12, 20)>
- <6, (14, 18, 21), (14, 6, 29), (18, 6, 22), (21, 6, 24)>
- <7, (13, 17, 21), (13, 7, 27), (17, 21, 29), (21, 7, 24), (21, 9, 14)>
- <8, (22, 8, 27)>
- <9, (14, 9, 19)>
- <12, (3, 12, 20), (12, 20, 27), (20, 2, 27), (20, 11, 13)>
- <20, (2, 3, 12), (2, 20, 27), (2, 27, 20), (3, 12, 20), (3, 20, 27), (3, 27, 12), (12, 20, 27), (20, 11, 13), (20, 12, 27), (20, 27, 2)>
- <21, (6, 21, 24), (7, 17, 21), (7, 21, 27), (9, 14, 21), (9, 19, 21)>
- <25, (1, 25, 29), (15, 25, 29), (16, 23, 25), (23, 10, 25), (23, 25, 29)>
- <27, (2, 7, 27), (2, 20, 27), (7, 27, 20), (20, 12, 27), (20, 27, 11), (27, 20, 11)>
