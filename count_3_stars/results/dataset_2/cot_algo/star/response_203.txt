Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 15) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 1) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 10) (13, 15) (11, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 10, 14
- Node 1: 8, 10, 16, 17
- Node 2: 4, 16, 18
- Node 3: 6, 8, 12
- Node 4: 0, 16, 18
- Node 5: 6, 11, 17
- Node 6: 3, 5
- Node 7: 12
- Node 8: 1, 3, 18
- Node 9: 12, 14, 15
- Node 10: 0, 1, 13
- Node 11: 5
- Node 12: 3, 7, 9, 16
- Node 13: 10, 15, 18
- Node 14: 0, 9, 13, 17
- Node 15: 9, 13, 19
- Node 16: 1, 2, 4, 12
- Node 17: 5, 14, 19
- Node 18: 2, 4, 8, 13
- Node 19: 15, 17

Given the neighbor sets for each node, we can now determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Node 0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13, and 16 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate \( \binom{3}{3} \) for these nodes.

\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 8 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (10, 14, 17)>
<1, (10, 16, 17)>
<4, (0, 16, 18)>
<5, (6, 11, 17)>
<8, (1, 3, 18)>
<12, (3, 9, 12)>
<13, (10, 15, 18)>
<16, (1, 12, 16)>
