Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (18, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (0, 13) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 0) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 11) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 9) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 5) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 2) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) (5, 16) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {13}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 17}
- Node 2: {1, 6, 11, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 5: {16}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 10}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 17}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 12}
- Node 9: {10, 12, 16}
- Node 10: {6, 9, 15, 16}
- Node 11: {2, 14, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 9, 16}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 17}
- Node 14: {11}
- Node 15: {4, 10, 11}
- Node 16: {5, 9, 10, 12}
- Node 17: {1, 7, 13, 19}
- Node 18: {4}
- Node 19: {2, 11, 17}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: 3-stars = 1
- Node 2: 3-stars = 1
- Node 3: 3-stars = 1
- Node 4: 3-stars = 1
- Node 6: 3-stars = 1
- Node 7: 3-stars = 1
- Node 8: 3-stars = 1
- Node 10: 3-stars = 1
- Node 11: 3-stars = 1
- Node 12: 3-stars = 1
- Node 13: 3-stars = 1
- Node 15: 3-stars = 1
- Node 16: 3-stars = 1
- Node 17: 3-stars = 1
- Node 19: 3-stars = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 14, so [14].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 8, 17)>
<2, (1, 11, 19)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 13)>
<6, (7, 10, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 17)>
<8, (1, 3, 12)>
<10, (6, 15, 16)>
<11, (2, 14, 19)>
<12, (8, 9, 16)>
<13, (0, 4, 17)>
<15, (4, 10, 11)>
<16, (5, 9, 10, 12)>
<17, (1, 7, 13, 19)>
