Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (14, 6) (14, 8) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 12) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) 

Response:
First, let's define the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 18}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 10, 15}
- Node 2: {9, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9, 15}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {14, 16, 17}
- Node 7: {0, 8, 18, 19}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 14, 17}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 16}
- Node 10: {1, 5, 12}
- Node 11: {16, 17}
- Node 12: {10, 19}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 14: {6, 8}
- Node 15: {1, 4}
- Node 16: {6, 9, 11, 18}
- Node 17: {6, 8, 11}
- Node 18: {0, 7, 16}
- Node 19: {7, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to check for potential 3-stars:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9, Node 10, Node 16, Node 18

Next, we count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 10, 15)>, <1, (5, 9, 10)>, <1, (5, 9, 13)>, <1, (9, 15, 4)>, <3, (4, 8, 13)>, <4, (0, 15, 4)>, <8, (3, 7, 17)>, <9, (1, 4, 16)>, <16, (6, 11, 18)>
