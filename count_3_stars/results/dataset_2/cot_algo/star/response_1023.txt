Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {9, 11, 10, 13, 2}
- Node 1: {7, 14, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 0, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 7, 11}
- Node 4: {5, 13, 11, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 11, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 7, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {11, 14, 10, 6}
- Node 9: {5, 3, 0}
- Node 10: {8, 0}
- Node 11: {5, 4, 3, 0, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {11, 6, 14, 1}
- Node 13: {4, 0, 2, 6}
- Node 14: {8, 1, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0, 3, and 11 can form 3-stars since they each have 5 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 = 34

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 9, 11>
- <3, 5, 11>
- <11, 4, 12>
- <11, 6, 12>
