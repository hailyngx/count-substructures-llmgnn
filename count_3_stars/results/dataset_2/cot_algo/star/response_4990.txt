Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 7, 11}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 12}
- Node 10: {5, 11}
- Node 11: {7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 6, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 11}

Next, we identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1, with 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 3, with 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4, with 6 neighbors: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 6, with 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7, with 5 neighbors: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 11, with 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 12, with 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 13, with 4 neighbors: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 82

Therefore, the final answer is [82], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (4, 7, 14)>
<3, (1, 4, 13)>
<4, (1, 3, 14)>
<6, (0, 9, 12)>
<7, (1, 4, 11)>
<11, (7, 8, 14)>
<12, (0, 6, 13)>
<13, (1, 3, 6)>
