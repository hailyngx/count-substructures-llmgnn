Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 15) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (9, 15) (9, 7) (2, 29) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 10) (22, 29) (22, 23) (22, 5) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 27) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 20) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 20) (0, 3) (0, 17) (1, 6) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 12) (26, 1) (28, 6) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 21) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (21, 29) (21, 18) (21, 5) (13, 3) (17, 2) (17, 0) (17, 3) (17, 27) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 27) (19, 4) (15, 16) (15, 9) (27, 6) (27, 23) (27, 17) (27, 24) (12, 20) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 14) (14, 4) (14, 12) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 28 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total 3-stars from each node, we get:
\[ 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 66 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [66].
