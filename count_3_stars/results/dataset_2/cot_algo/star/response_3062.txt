Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 7) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (2, 0) (2, 19) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 14) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 2) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 2, 16}
- Node 1: {3, 15, 18, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 19}
- Node 3: {6, 1, 11}
- Node 4: {5, 17}
- Node 5: {12, 15, 4}
- Node 6: {9, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 12, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 7, 18, 14}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 17, 10}
- Node 10: {9, 11}
- Node 11: {3, 10, 0, 14}
- Node 12: {5, 7}
- Node 13: {15, 16, 14}
- Node 14: {11, 8, 13}
- Node 15: {5, 1, 18, 13}
- Node 16: {0, 17, 13}
- Node 17: {9, 4, 16}
- Node 18: {1, 15, 8}
- Node 19: {2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Total 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 15, 18)>, <3, (1, 11, 6)>, <6, (3, 9, 8)>, <8, (6, 9, 14)>, <9, (6, 8, 17)>, <11, (1, 10, 14)>, <13, (15, 16, 14)>, <15, (1, 3, 18)>, <16, (0, 13, 17)>, <17, (4, 9, 16)>
