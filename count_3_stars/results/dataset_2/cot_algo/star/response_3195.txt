Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 13) (1, 27) (3, 10) (3, 12) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 25) (23, 15) (23, 21) (23, 10) (12, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 1) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 26) (4, 22) (4, 14) (4, 26) (8, 16) (8, 25) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 13) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 21) (26, 22) (26, 27) (26, 4) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 25) (11, 2) (24, 1) (24, 20) (20, 29) (20, 17) (20, 24) (15, 1) (15, 23) (21, 23) (21, 17) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 22) (14, 4) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 19) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 13) (10, 3) (10, 23) (18, 12) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {13, 15, 24, 27}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 11, 28}
- Node 3: Neighbors {10, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {14, 22, 26}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {18, 19}
- Node 8: Neighbors {16, 25}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5, 16, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 23}
- Node 11: Neighbors {2, 28, 29, 25}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 18, 27}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 19, 25, 28}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 22}
- Node 15: Neighbors {1, 23}
- Node 16: Neighbors {8, 9, 18}
- Node 17: Neighbors {20, 21, 29}
- Node 18: Neighbors {7, 12, 16, 27}
- Node 19: Neighbors {7, 9, 13}
- Node 20: Neighbors {17, 24, 29}
- Node 21: Neighbors {17, 23}
- Node 22: Neighbors {4, 14, 25, 26}
- Node 23: Neighbors {10, 15, 21}
- Node 24: Neighbors {1, 20}
- Node 25: Neighbors {8, 11, 13, 22}
- Node 26: Neighbors {4, 22, 27}
- Node 27: Neighbors {12, 16, 18, 26}
- Node 28: Neighbors {2, 11, 13, 29}
- Node 29: Neighbors {11, 17, 20, 28}

Now, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
Nodes {9, 11, 13, 18, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29} have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

Unique 3-stars found:
