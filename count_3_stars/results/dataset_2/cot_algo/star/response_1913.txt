Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 11) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 8) (17, 2) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 29) (8, 17) (8, 25) (8, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 9) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 7) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 5) (26, 19) (26, 25) (15, 7) (15, 20) (15, 5) (15, 11) (20, 15) (28, 24) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 24) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 16) (29, 3) (29, 27) (29, 6) (6, 25) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 27) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 16) (22, 14) (22, 8) (11, 21) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 5) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 25) (16, 24) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 4) (27, 21) (27, 29) (27, 6) (0, 18) (0, 23) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 9) (23, 1) (23, 17) (23, 6) (23, 0) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
The three nodes linked to each node are as follows:

Node 1: {21, 3, 23}
Node 21: {1, 27, 19}
Node 14: {17, 22, 2}
Node 17: {14, 23, 8}
Node 3: {1, 10, 29}
Node 8: {17, 25, 22}
Node 13: {16, 10, 9}
Node 7: {12, 25, 11}
Node 12: {7}
Node 4: {2}
Node 18: {7, 16, 0}
Node 19: {21, 26, 5}
Node 26: {19, 25}
Node 15: {7, 20, 5}
Node 20: {15}
Node 28: {24}
Node 5: {19, 15, 11}
Node 25: {8, 7, 26}
Node 29: {3, 27, 6}
Node 6: {25, 29, 23}
Node 24: {28, 5, 16}
Node 22: {14, 8}
Node 11: {21, 7, 15}
Node 16: {13, 18, 25}
Node 2: {14, 17, 4}
Node 27: {21, 29, 6}
Node 0: {18, 23}
Node 10: {3, 13, 9}
Node 9: {13, 10}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 21, 14, 17, 3, 8, 13, 7, 18, 19, 26, 15, 5, 25, 29, 6, 24, 16, 2, 27, 0, 10

Calculations:
1. Number of 3-stars formed from nodes with 3 neighbors:
\( \binom{21}{3} + \binom{17}{3} + \binom{12}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1330 \)

2. Number of 3-stars formed from nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
\( \binom{19}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{15}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{10}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 3461 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1330 + 3461 = 4791

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4791].
