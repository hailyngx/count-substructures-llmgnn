Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 4) (10, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 15) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 4) (7, 16) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 5) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 14) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 6) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (6, 19) (6, 15) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 19) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 16) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 15) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 2) (9, 13) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 19}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 9, 16}
- Node 3: {4, 13, 17}
- Node 4: {3, 14, 17}
- Node 5: {11, 12, 16}
- Node 6: {2, 15, 19}
- Node 7: {14, 16}
- Node 8: {0, 15, 17}
- Node 9: {2, 13}
- Node 10: {12}
- Node 11: {5, 14, 15}
- Node 12: {5, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 14: {4, 7, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 15: {6, 8, 11}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 7}
- Node 17: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 18: {14, 19}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 14, 18}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: [0 choose 3] = 0
- Node 1: [0 choose 3] = 0
- Node 2: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 3: <3, (4, 13, 17)> = 1
- Node 4: <4, (3, 14, 17)> = 1
- Node 5: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 6: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 7: [2 choose 3] = 0
- Node 8: <3, (0, 15, 17)> = 1
- Node 9: [2 choose 3] = 0
- Node 10: [1 choose 3] = 0
- Node 11: <3, (5, 14, 15)> = 1
- Node 12: [2 choose 3] = 0
- Node 13: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 14: <5, (4, 7, 11)> = 1
- Node 15: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 16: <3, (2, 5, 7)> = 1
- Node 17: <3, (3, 4, 8)> = 1
- Node 18: [1 choose 3] = 0
- Node 19: <3, (6, 14, 18)> = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
