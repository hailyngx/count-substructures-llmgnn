Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in a more visual way. Here is the adjacency list for each node:

0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9
1: 0, 8
2: 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
3: 0, 2
4: 0, 2, 6, 7
5: 8, 9
6: 0, 2, 4, 7, 9
7: 2, 4, 6, 9
8: 0, 1, 5, 9
9: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, we need to find all the 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 0 as the center are:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 1, 6>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 1, 9>, 
<0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 6>, <0, 3, 8>, <0, 3, 9>, 
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 7>, <0, 4, 8>, <0, 4, 9>, 
<0, 6, 7>, <0, 6, 8>, <0, 6, 9>, 
<0, 8, 9>, 
<0, 1, 8>

Node 2 also has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars with node 2 as the center are:
<2, 3, 4>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 3, 9>, 
<2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 4, 9>, 
<2, 6, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, 
<2, 7, 9>

Adding these up, we have a total of 20 + 10 = 30 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [30].
