Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8: 2, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 8

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with (0, 4, 5)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with (1, 7, 9)
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with (1, 5, 9)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with (1, 4, 7)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (4, 8, 9)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with (3, 4, 8)

Therefore, there are a total of 6 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [6].
