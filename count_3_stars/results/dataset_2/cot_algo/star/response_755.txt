Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors (6, 7, 3, 11, 10, 1)
- Node 1: Neighbors (8, 5, 0, 2)
- Node 2: Neighbors (9, 7, 10, 14, 1)
- Node 3: Neighbors (9, 12, 11, 0)
- Node 4: Neighbors (9, 5, 14, 11)
- Node 5: Neighbors (8, 4, 12, 1)
- Node 6: Neighbors (9, 7, 11, 0)
- Node 7: Neighbors (6, 12, 0, 2)
- Node 8: Neighbors (5, 10, 1)
- Node 9: Neighbors (6, 4, 2, 14, 10, 3)
- Node 10: Neighbors (9, 8, 0, 2)
- Node 11: Neighbors (6, 4, 3, 0)
- Node 12: Neighbors (7, 5, 3)
- Node 13: Neighbor (14)
- Node 14: Neighbors (9, 4, 2, 13)

Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0: [inom{6}{3} ] = [20]
- Node 2: <2, (9, 7, 14)>
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3} ] = [4]
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3} ] = [4]
- Node 9: <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 14, 10)>, <9, (4, 5, 14)>
- Node 14: [inom{4}{3} ] = [4]

Summing up the configurations, we have a total of [20+4+4+4] = [32] 3-stars.
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (9, 7, 14)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 14, 10)>, and <9, (4, 5, 14)>.
