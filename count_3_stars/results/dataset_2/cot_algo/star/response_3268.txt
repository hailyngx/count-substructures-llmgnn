Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 1, 7, and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 0, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 3, 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 4, 1.

Now, let's determine the number of 3-star graphs in this network:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 52 \), thus, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (9, 2, 4)>, <1, (9, 2, 3)>, <1, (9, 2, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (9, 1, 8)>, <4, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (6, 3, 2)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (9, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 1, 3)>.
