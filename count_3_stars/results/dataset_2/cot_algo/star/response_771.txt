Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 4, 6, 8, 9
Node 1: 5, 9
Node 2: 3, 6, 8
Node 3: 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7
Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
Node 9: 1, 7, 8, 0

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

Calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us 32, so the final answer is [32].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 5)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<7, (4, 5, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<9, (1, 7, 8)>.
