Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 17) (26, 13) (26, 21) (26, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (21, 26) (21, 5) (21, 15) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 20) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 14) (2, 25) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 11) (13, 26) (13, 25) (13, 28) (13, 19) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 22) (4, 27) (4, 24) (27, 4) (27, 23) (15, 21) (15, 0) (15, 25) (7, 25) (7, 28) (25, 2) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 7) (11, 29) (11, 12) (23, 2) (23, 27) (23, 19) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 22) (10, 14) (18, 16) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 23) (22, 17) (22, 10) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 12) (24, 4) (24, 0) (0, 26) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 24) (28, 13) (28, 17) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 14) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 5) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 28) (5, 21) (5, 3) (5, 16) (8, 10) (8, 20) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 28) (20, 6) (20, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 15, 17, 24, 26}
- Node 1: {10, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {14, 23, 25, 29}
- Node 3: {5, 12, 16}
- Node 4: {24, 27}
- Node 5: {3, 16, 21}
- Node 6: {9, 19, 20}
- Node 7: {25, 28}
- Node 8: {10, 20}
- Node 9: {6, 17, 29}
- Node 10: {1, 8, 14, 22}
- Node 11: {12, 29}
- Node 12: {3, 11, 28}
- Node 13: {19, 25, 26, 28}
- Node 14: {2, 10, 28}
- Node 15: {0, 21, 25}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 5, 18}
- Node 17: {0, 1, 9, 22, 28}
- Node 18: {16}
- Node 19: {6, 13, 23}
- Node 20: {6, 8}
- Node 21: {5, 15, 26}
- Node 22: {10, 17}
- Node 23: {2, 19, 27}
- Node 24: {0, 4}
- Node 25: {2, 7, 13, 15}
- Node 26: {0, 13, 15, 21}
- Node 27: {4, 23}
- Node 28: {7, 12, 13, 14, 17}
- Node 29: {2, 9, 11}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to count the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0, 5C3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 1, 3C3 = 1 3-star
- Node 2, 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3, 3C3 = 1 3-star
- Node 6, 3C3 = 1 3-star
- Node 9, 3C3 = 1 3-star
- Node 10, 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 13, 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 14, 3C3 = 1 3-star
- Node 15, 3C3 = 1 3-star
- Node 16, 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 17, 5C3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 19, 3C3 = 1 3-star
- Node 21, 3C3 = 1 3-star
- Node 23, 3C3 = 1 3-star
- Node 25, 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 26, 4C3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 28, 5C3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 29, 3C3 = 1 3-star

Total 3-stars: 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].
