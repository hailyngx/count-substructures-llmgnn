Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 19) (15, 4) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 18) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 5) (1, 5) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 16) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 6) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 10) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 14) (2, 10) (12, 3) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 7) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 13) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 11, 16, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 14, 10
- Node 3: 5, 12, 4
- Node 4: 11, 3, 15, 14, 10
- Node 5: 3, 9, 1
- Node 6: 17, 19, 7, 13
- Node 7: 6, 13
- Node 8: 11, 0, 19
- Node 9: 17, 5
- Node 10: 18, 4, 2
- Node 11: 16, 0, 8, 17, 4
- Node 12: 3
- Node 13: 16, 6, 7
- Node 14: 4, 2
- Node 15: 19, 4
- Node 16: 11, 0, 13, 19
- Node 17: 11, 9, 18, 6
- Node 18: 17, 19, 10
- Node 19: 16, 15, 8, 18, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 11, 16, 8
- Node 4: 11, 3, 15, 14, 10
- Node 5: 3, 9, 1
- Node 6: 17, 19, 7, 13
- Node 11: 16, 0, 8, 17, 4
- Node 16: 11, 0, 13, 19
- Node 17: 11, 9, 18, 6
- Node 18: 17, 19, 10
- Node 19: 16, 15, 8, 18, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 16: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 19: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 35

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [35], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 11, 16, 8>
- <4, 11, 3, 15>
- <4, 11, 3, 14>
- <4, 11, 3, 10>
- <4, 15, 14, 10>
- <5, 3, 9, 1>
- <6, 17, 19, 7>
- <6, 17, 19, 13>
- <11, 16, 0, 8>
- <11, 16, 0, 17>
- <11, 16, 0, 4>
- <16, 11, 0, 13>
- <16, 11, 0, 19>
- <17, 11, 9, 18>
- <17, 11, 9, 6>
- <17, 18, 19, 10>
- <19, 16, 15, 8>
- <19, 16, 15, 18>
- <19, 11, 8, 18>
- <19, 17, 18, 6>
