Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 15) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 18) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 10) (12, 6) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (15, 4) (15, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: neighbors {11, 16, 19}
- Node 1: neighbors {7, 17, 19}
- Node 2: neighbors {6, 9, 15}
- Node 3: neighbors {5, 18}
- Node 4: neighbors {8, 9, 13, 15}
- Node 5: neighbors {3, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 6: neighbors {2, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 11}
- Node 8: neighbors {4, 5, 13}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 4, 16}
- Node 10: neighbors {16, 18}
- Node 11: neighbors {0, 5, 7, 13}
- Node 12: neighbors {6, 14}
- Node 13: neighbors {4, 8, 11}
- Node 14: neighbors {5, 6, 12}
- Node 15: neighbors {2, 4}
- Node 16: neighbors {0, 9, 10}
- Node 17: neighbors {1, 18, 19}
- Node 18: neighbors {3, 6, 10, 17}
- Node 19: neighbors {0, 1, 17}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 19 \)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, (8, 13, 11)>
- <5, (3, 11, 14)>
- <6, (2, 12, 14)>
- <8, (4, 5, 13)>
- <9, (2, 4, 16)>
- <11, (0, 7, 13)>
