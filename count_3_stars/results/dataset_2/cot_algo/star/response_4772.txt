Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 8) (15, 24) (15, 21) (27, 4) (27, 23) (4, 27) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (23, 27) (23, 1) (23, 9) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 1) (20, 0) (20, 24) (21, 15) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 11) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 21) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 2) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 8) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 24) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 5) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 19) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 25) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (25, 12) (25, 14) (25, 17) (25, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 25) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 24) (16, 6) (1, 23) (1, 0) (2, 11) (9, 4) (9, 23) (9, 21) (29, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 17, 20}
- Node 1: {0, 23}
- Node 2: {11}
- Node 3: {11, 16, 18}
- Node 4: {7, 9, 12, 27}
- Node 5: {8, 18, 19, 24, 28}
- Node 6: {16, 17, 19}
- Node 7: {4, 10, 18}
- Node 8: {5, 15, 25, 26, 28}
- Node 9: {4, 21, 23}
- Node 10: {7, 19, 21}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 21, 24}
- Node 12: {4, 17, 25}
- Node 13: {16, 17}
- Node 14: {25, 29}
- Node 15: {8, 21, 24}
- Node 16: {3, 6, 13, 24}
- Node 17: {0, 6, 12, 13, 25}
- Node 18: {3, 5, 7, 19, 26}
- Node 19: {5, 6, 10}
- Node 20: {0, 24}
- Node 21: {9, 10, 11, 15}
- Node 23: {1, 9, 27}
- Node 24: {11, 15, 16, 20, 5}
- Node 25: {8, 12, 14, 17}
- Node 26: {8, 18, 28}
- Node 27: {4, 23}
- Node 28: {5, 8, 26}
- Node 29: {14}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with {13, 25, 6}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with {25, 26, 28}.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with {18, 24, 28}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with {27, 7, 12}.
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with {11, 15, 16}.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars are <17, 13, 25, 6>, <8, 25, 26, 28>, <5, 18, 24, 28>, <4, 27, 7, 12>, <24, 11, 15, 16>.
