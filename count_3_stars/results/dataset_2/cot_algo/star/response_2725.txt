Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (1, 5, 11)>
<4, (3, 7, 11)>
<4, (3, 11, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 5)>
<12, (1, 2, 9)>
<12, (1, 9, 14)>
<12, (2, 9, 14)>
<0, (2, 6, 14)>
<0, (2, 6, 14)>
<9, (3, 11, 12)>
<9, (2, 11, 14)>
<9, (2, 12, 14)>
