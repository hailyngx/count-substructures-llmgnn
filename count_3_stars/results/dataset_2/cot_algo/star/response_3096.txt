Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 7}

Next, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 6, and Node 7 have 4 neighbors each.
- Node 2 and Node 8 have 6 neighbors each.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we will apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [62].

Finally, the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 4, 7)>
