Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
We will first list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {0, 1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {0, 2, 4, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8}

Now, we will check each node that has three or more neighbors to see if they can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 4 neighbors
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors
- Node 9: No 3-star can be formed as it has only 3 neighbors

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

Unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (8, 9, 6)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>,
<3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
