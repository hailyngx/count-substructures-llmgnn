Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, let's organize the given edges by node:

Node 0: {4, 8, 12, 11, 10}
Node 1: {9, 4, 13, 14}
Node 2: {4, 5}
Node 3: {6, 11, 14, 12}
Node 4: {7, 13, 0, 10, 1, 2}
Node 5: {7, 13, 2, 10, 14}
Node 6: {10, 3, 11}
Node 7: {4, 5, 8}
Node 8: {7, 14, 0}
Node 9: {11, 10, 1}
Node 10: {6, 9, 4, 13, 5, 0}
Node 11: {9, 6, 3, 0}
Node 12: {3, 0}
Node 13: {4, 7, 1, 10, 14}
Node 14: {8, 13, 1, 3, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
There are a total of \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars involving Node 4.
There are a total of \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars involving Node 10.
There are a total of \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars involving Nodes 0, 5, 13, and 14.
There are a total of \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars involving Nodes 1, 3, and 11.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 54. 
Thus, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (7, 13, 10)>
<10, (6, 9, 13)>
<0, (4, 8, 12)>
<0, (4, 10, 13)>
<0, (8, 12, 11)>
<1, (9, 13, 14)>
<3, (6, 11, 14)>
<4, (7, 1, 2)>
<4, (10, 13, 5)>
<5, (7, 13, 14)>
<10, (6, 4, 13)>
<13, (7, 1, 14)>
<14, (8, 13, 5)>
