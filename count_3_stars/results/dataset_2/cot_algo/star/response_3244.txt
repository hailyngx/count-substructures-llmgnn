Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 10) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 21) (1, 26) (1, 12) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 19) (18, 9) (18, 29) (22, 9) (22, 24) (25, 29) (25, 10) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 24) (15, 12) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 27) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 21) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 24) (9, 18) (9, 22) (9, 27) (24, 22) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 28) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 10) (28, 23) (5, 17) (5, 12) (5, 21) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 21) (0, 29) (13, 14) (13, 20) (13, 21) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 0) (21, 13) (23, 28) (23, 7) (23, 29) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 24) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 19) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 0) (29, 23) (7, 14) (7, 23) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 4) (10, 16) (10, 25) (10, 28) (10, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edge list:

Node 0: 11, 3, 4, 21, 29
Node 1: 26, 12
Node 2: 11, 8, 21
Node 3: 0, 19, 28
Node 4: 0, 6
Node 5: 17, 12, 21
Node 6: 11, 16, 4
Node 7: 14, 23
Node 8: 2, 24
Node 9: 18, 22, 27
Node 10: 16, 25, 28, 19
Node 11: 0, 2, 6
Node 12: 1, 15, 5, 19
Node 13: 14, 20, 21
Node 14: 17, 13, 7
Node 15: 12
Node 16: 10, 6
Node 17: 14, 5, 21
Node 18: 9, 29
Node 19: 3, 10, 12
Node 20: 26, 13, 27
Node 21: 17, 2, 5, 0, 13
Node 22: 9, 24
Node 23: 28, 7, 29
Node 24: 22, 8, 26, 27, 28
Node 25: 10, 29
Node 26: 1, 20, 24
Node 27: 9, 20, 24
Node 28: 3, 10, 24, 23
Node 29: 18, 25, 0, 23

Now, we will identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars formed:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 21, 24, 28
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 0, 12

For nodes with 4 or more neighbors, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
Node 21: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 24: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 28: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 12: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, 21, 13>
<0, 21, 5>
<0, 21, 17>
<0, 29, 23>
<0, 29, 18>
<0, 29, 25>
<0, 29, 23>
