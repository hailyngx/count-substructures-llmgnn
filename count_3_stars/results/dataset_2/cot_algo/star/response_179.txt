Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 27) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 25) (17, 6) (2, 8) (2, 12) (18, 14) (18, 21) (18, 25) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 19) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 26) (8, 27) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 0) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 26) (6, 17) (6, 28) (6, 20) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 22) (9, 21) (22, 9) (22, 0) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 16) (5, 20) (19, 12) (19, 25) (19, 16) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 24) (10, 15) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 4) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 10) (21, 16) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 23) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 25) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 21) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 13) (27, 3) (27, 8) (27, 29) (20, 6) (20, 5) (20, 4) (24, 1) (24, 0) (4, 10) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 4) (25, 14) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {22, 24, 10, 28, 13}
- Node 1: {15, 11, 24}
- Node 2: {8, 12}
- Node 3: {27}
- Node 4: {10, 13, 20, 23}
- Node 5: {20}
- Node 6: {17, 28, 20, 13}
- Node 7: {14, 12, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 11, 26, 27}
- Node 9: {7, 22, 21}
- Node 10: {15, 21, 0, 4}
- Node 11: {8, 1, 23}
- Node 12: {2, 7, 19}
- Node 13: {6, 0, 4}
- Node 14: {7, 18, 25}
- Node 15: {1, 10}
- Node 16: {26, 21, 19}
- Node 17: {6}
- Node 18: {14, 21, 25}
- Node 19: {12, 16, 25}
- Node 20: {6, 5, 4}
- Node 21: {18, 10, 9, 16}
- Node 22: {9, 0}
- Node 23: {11, 4, 25}
- Node 24: {1, 0}
- Node 25: {14, 18, 19, 23}
- Node 26: {8, 28, 29, 16}
- Node 27: {3, 8, 29}
- Node 28: {29, 6, 26, 0}
- Node 29: {28, 27, 26}

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 10: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [1]
- Node 15: [1]
- Node 16: [1]
- Node 18: [1]
- Node 19: [1]
- Node 21: [1]
- Node 23: [1]
- Node 25: [1]
- Node 26: [1]
- Node 28: [1]
- Node 29: [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 10, 24>
- <1, 15, 10>
- <2, 8, 27>
- <3, 27, 8>
- <4, 10, 13>
- <5, 20, 6>
- <6, 13, 0>
- <7, 12, 9>
- <8, 11, 27>
- <9, 21, 10>
- <11, 8, 1>
- <12, 2, 7>
- <13, 6, 4>
- <14, 7, 18>
- <15, 1, 10>
- <16, 19, 26>
- <17, 6, 28>
- <18, 14, 25>
- <19, 12, 25>
