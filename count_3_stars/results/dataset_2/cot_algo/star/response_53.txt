Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 2) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:  
Node 0: degree 4  
Node 1: degree 2  
Node 2: degree 3  
Node 3: degree 3  
Node 4: degree 4  
Node 5: degree 2  
Node 6: degree 4  
Node 7: degree 3  
Node 8: degree 3  
Node 9: degree 4  
Node 12: degree 2  
Node 13: degree 2  
Node 14: degree 5  
Node 15: degree 5  
Node 16: degree 1  
Node 17: degree 3  
Node 18: degree 4  
Node 19: degree 4    

Now, let's identify the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 11, 14, 19, 2  
Node 1 neighbors: 9, 3  
Node 2 neighbors: 14, 0, 19, 7  
Node 3 neighbors: 14, 1, 4  
Node 4 neighbors: 11, 3, 18, 6  
Node 5 neighbors: 19, 18  
Node 6 neighbors: 4, 8, 15, 13  
Node 7 neighbors: 17, 15, 2  
Node 8 neighbors: 9, 19, 6  
Node 9 neighbors: 8, 14, 1, 13  
Node 12 neighbors: 18, 15  
Node 13 neighbors: 9, 6  
Node 14 neighbors: 9, 17, 0, 3, 2  
Node 15 neighbors: 16, 18, 7, 6, 12  
Node 16 neighbors: 15  
Node 17 neighbors: 14, 7, 15  
Node 18 neighbors: 5, 4, 15, 12  
Node 19 neighbors: 5, 0, 8, 2  

Now, we can see that nodes 14 and 15 have 5 neighbors each, which means we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars involving each of these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].  
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<14, (9, 17, 3)>  
<14, (9, 17, 0)>  
<14, (9, 3, 2)>  
<14, (17, 0, 2)>  
<14, (17, 3, 2)>  
<15, (16, 7, 6)>  
<15, (16, 7, 12)>  
<15, (7, 6, 12)>  
<15, (18, 6, 12)>  
<15, (18, 7, 12)>
