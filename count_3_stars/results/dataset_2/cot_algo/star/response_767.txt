Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 20) (1, 14) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 12) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 13) (11, 13) (11, 20) (28, 9) (28, 18) (28, 17) (28, 24) (5, 21) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 29) (13, 6) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 24) (25, 7) (25, 15) (15, 25) (15, 16) (15, 23) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 0) (10, 19) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (24, 28) (24, 7) (24, 19) (19, 10) (19, 24) (19, 22) (19, 2) (22, 19) (22, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 17) (17, 28) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 27) (2, 19) (2, 27) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 29) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 27) (23, 18) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 20) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 18) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 11) (20, 23) (20, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 20) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 10, 6}
- Node 1: {14}
- Node 2: {19, 27}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 22, 17}
- Node 4: {14, 3}
- Node 5: {21}
- Node 6: {13, 0, 12}
- Node 7: {25, 3, 24}
- Node 8: {14, 16, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {28, 27}
- Node 10: {0, 19}
- Node 11: {20, 13}
- Node 12: {8, 6, 20}
- Node 13: {18, 11, 29, 6}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 8, 18}
- Node 15: {16, 23, 25}
- Node 16: {21, 8, 15, 29}
- Node 17: {28, 3, 23, 27}
- Node 18: {23, 13, 14, 28}
- Node 19: {10, 24, 22, 2}
- Node 20: {26, 21, 11, 23, 12}
- Node 21: {16, 20, 5}
- Node 22: {19, 3}
- Node 23: {18, 15, 17, 20}
- Node 24: {28, 7, 19}
- Node 25: {7, 15}
- Node 26: {20}
- Node 27: {9, 17, 2, 29}
- Node 28: {18, 9, 17, 24}
- Node 29: {13, 16, 27}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0: [1] (as it has only three neighbors)
- Node 6: [1] (as it has only three neighbors)
- Node 8: [1] (as it has only three neighbors)
- Node 12: [1] (as it has only three neighbors)
- Node 13: [1] (as it has only three neighbors)
- Node 14: [1] (as it has only three neighbors)
- Node 16: [1] (as it has only three neighbors)
- Node 21: <21, (5, 20, 16)>
- Node 23: <23, (15, 17, 18)>
- Node 27: <27, (9, 2, 29)>
- Node 28: <28, (18, 17, 24)>

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
