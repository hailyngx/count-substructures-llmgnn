Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 4) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 17) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 14) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 0) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 4) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 12, 15}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 15}
- Node 2: {12, 19}
- Node 3: {8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 17}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 14, 17}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 13, 16}
- Node 8: {3, 12, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 6}
- Node 10: {6, 12, 15}
- Node 11: {13}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 8, 10, 18}
- Node 13: {7, 11, 17, 19}
- Node 14: {6, 15, 18}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 10, 14}
- Node 16: {7, 17}
- Node 17: {4, 6, 8, 13, 16}
- Node 18: {12, 14, 19}
- Node 19: {2, 13, 18}

Now, we identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 12, Node 13, Node 15, Node 17
- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: Node 6, Node 7

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 15>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 12, 18>, <0, 12, 2>, <12, 10, 15>, <12, 10, 18>, <12, 10, 0>, <12, 18, 14>, <13, 7, 17>, <13, 17, 16>, <13, 17, 19>, <13, 17, 6>, <17, 6, 14>, <17, 13, 16>, <17, 13, 19>, <17, 13, 7>, <17, 8, 12>, <17, 8, 3>, <7, 1, 15>, <7, 1, 5>, <15, 0, 12>, <15, 10, 6>, <15, 10, 14>, <15, 14, 18>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 9, 10>, <6, 9, 17>, <6, 10, 15>, <6, 14, 18>, <8, 3, 9>, <8, 3, 12>, <8, 17, 13>, <8, 17, 16> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [32].
