Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 14) (2, 5) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 13) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- 0: 1, 4, 8, 13
- 1: 0, 7, 11, 13
- 2: 5, 11, 14
- 3: 4, 6, 9, 10, 11
- 4: 0, 3, 5, 10
- 5: 2, 4, 11, 12
- 6: 3, 7, 13, 14
- 7: 1, 6, 13, 14
- 8: 0, 10, 11, 12
- 9: 3, 11, 13, 14
- 10: 3, 4, 8
- 11: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 14
- 12: 5, 8, 13
- 13: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9, 12
- 14: 2, 6, 7, 9, 11

Nodes 0, 3, 11, and 13 have 4 or more neighbors, so we need to count the number of 3-stars centered at these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 8, 13)>
- <3, (4, 11, 13)>
- <11, (1, 8, 14)>
- <13, (1, 6, 9)>
