Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 17) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (12, 4) (12, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 10) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (15, 5) (15, 17) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 19}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 10, 13, 17}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 6, 17}
- Node 4: Neighbors {12, 16, 19}
- Node 5: Neighbors {10, 13, 15, 18}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 8, 19}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 6, 18}
- Node 10: Neighbors {2, 5, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 14, 16}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 10}
- Node 13: Neighbors {1, 2, 5, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {8, 11}
- Node 15: Neighbors {5, 17}
- Node 16: Neighbors {4, 11, 17, 19}
- Node 17: Neighbors {2, 3, 15, 16}
- Node 18: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 7, 16, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. The unique 3-stars are: 

<1, 6, 13>
<2, 9, 17>
<3, 0, 17>
<5, 10, 13>
<9, 6, 18>
<10, 2, 12>
<13, 1, 2>
<16, 4, 19>
<17, 3, 15>
<19, 0, 7>
