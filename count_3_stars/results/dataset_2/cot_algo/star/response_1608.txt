Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 9) (3, 19) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 9) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 2) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 16) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 11) (28, 1) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 27) (28, 12) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 23) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 6) (7, 0) (7, 28) (7, 10) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 24) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (25, 21) (27, 28) (27, 21) (27, 18) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 20) (5, 22) (5, 16) (5, 11) (5, 21) (10, 7) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 29) (24, 17) (24, 15) (24, 4) (18, 27) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (4, 16) (4, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 15) (12, 14) (12, 28) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 5) (29, 22) (29, 14) (29, 21) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {6, 9, 28}
- Node 2: {13, 17, 19}
- Node 3: {19}
- Node 4: {16, 24}
- Node 5: {11, 16, 21, 22}
- Node 6: {1, 8, 20, 23}
- Node 7: {0, 10, 28}
- Node 8: {6, 13, 17}
- Node 9: {1, 15, 20, 23}
- Node 10: {7}
- Node 11: {5, 22, 26}
- Node 12: {14, 28}
- Node 13: {2, 8, 21}
- Node 14: {12, 16, 19, 29}
- Node 15: {9, 24}
- Node 16: {4, 5, 14, 15}
- Node 17: {2, 8, 20, 24}
- Node 18: {27}
- Node 19: {2, 3, 14}
- Node 20: {6, 9, 17, 23, 26}
- Node 21: {5, 13, 21, 25, 27, 29}
- Node 22: {5, 11, 29}
- Node 23: {6, 9, 20}
- Node 24: {4, 15, 17}
- Node 25: {21}
- Node 26: {11, 20, 28}
- Node 27: {18, 21, 28}
- Node 28: {1, 7, 12, 26, 27}
- Node 29: {14, 21, 22}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 20 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 21 forms 20 3-stars. (Calculated using \( \binom{6}{3} \))
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 26 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 27 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 28 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 29 forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of 34 3-stars. So, the final answer is [34].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 6, 23>
- <5, 16, 21>
- <6, 1, 8>
- <8, 13, 21>
- <9, 20, 23>
- <13, 2, 21>
- <14, 19, 29>
- <16, 4, 24>
- <17, 8, 20>
- <20, 6, 23>
- <21, 13, 27>
- <22, 5, 29>
- <26, 11, 22>
- <27, 21, 28>
- <28, 1, 12>
- <29, 14, 21>
