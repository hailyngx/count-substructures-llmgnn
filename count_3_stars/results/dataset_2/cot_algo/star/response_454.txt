Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 6) (13, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 14) (16, 15) (16, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 19) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17) 

Response:
First, let's list down the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 9
Node 1: 3, 15
Node 2: 0, 5, 12
Node 3: 0, 1, 4
Node 4: 3, 7, 9, 11, 18
Node 5: 2, 5, 10, 11
Node 6: 12, 13, 17, 19
Node 7: 4, 10, 18
Node 8: 9, 13
Node 9: 0, 4, 8, 10
Node 10: 5, 7, 9, 11
Node 11: 4, 5, 10, 17
Node 12: 2, 6, 19
Node 13: 6, 8
Node 14: 16, 18
Node 15: 1, 16
Node 16: 14, 15
Node 17: 6, 11, 19
Node 18: 4, 7, 14
Node 19: 6, 12, 17

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <4, (3, 9, 11)>, <4, (7, 10, 18)>, <4, (7, 11, 18)>, <4, (10, 9, 11)>, <4, (10, 5, 11)>, <4, (18, 7, 14)>, <4, (18, 14, 16)>, <4, (18, 7, 16)>, <4, (18, 14, 16)>, <4, (18, 16, 7)>.

The total number of 3-stars is 10, so the final answer is [10].
