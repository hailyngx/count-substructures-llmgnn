Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5, 7}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 = 30
Therefore, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (1, 8, 3)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 8, 6)>
<4, (3, 8, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 4, 3)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 4)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 7, 4)>
<8, (5, 7, 6)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<8, (5, 1, 6)>
