Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (11, 4) (11, 0) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (2, 7) (1, 19) (1, 8) (1, 18) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {13, 16, 11, 18}
Node 1: {19, 8, 18}
Node 2: {7}
Node 3: {5, 17, 12, 19, 13}
Node 4: {5, 14, 11}
Node 5: {3, 4}
Node 6: {13, 8, 18}
Node 7: {12, 10, 2}
Node 8: {10, 15, 6, 1}
Node 9: {15, 19}
Node 10: {7, 15, 8, 18}
Node 11: {4, 0}
Node 12: {7, 3}
Node 13: {17, 3, 0, 6}
Node 14: {17, 4}
Node 15: {9, 10, 8, 16}
Node 16: {15, 0}
Node 17: {14, 13, 3}
Node 18: {10, 0, 6, 1}
Node 19: {9, 1, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars 
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 13, 6>, <0, 13, 18>, <0, 16, 15>, <0, 18, 1>, <1, 19, 8>, <3, 5, 17>, <3, 5, 19>, <3, 12, 7>, <3, 13, 17>, <3, 13, 19>, <4, 5, 14>, <8, 10, 15>, <8, 10, 18>, <8, 15, 16>, <10, 15, 9>, <10, 15, 18>, <13, 17, 3>, <15, 16, 0>, <18, 0, 6>, <18, 1, 19>.
