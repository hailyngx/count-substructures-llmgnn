Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {5, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 7, 8}

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 3 3-stars <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 3 3-stars <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10, which we represent as [10].

Unique 3-stars found: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>.
