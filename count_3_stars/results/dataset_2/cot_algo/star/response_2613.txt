Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 5, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it is a part of:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 68 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8-<1, 3, 6>
