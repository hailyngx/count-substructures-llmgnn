Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {2, 6, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 3: {4, 6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 3, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 9: {3, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 4, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {9, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [64].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <3, 4, 11>
- <4, 10, 12>
- <4, 10, 11>
- <10, 11, 13>
- <10, 11, 12>
