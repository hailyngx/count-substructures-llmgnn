Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 11, 13
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 8, 14
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13
- Node 4: 6, 10, 11, 13
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 10
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 12
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 14
- Node 8: 2, 9, 13
- Node 9: 7, 8, 14
- Node 10: 4, 5, 7, 12
- Node 11: 0, 4
- Node 12: 6, 10
- Node 13: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 14: 2, 7, 9

Now, let's find all the 3-stars:
- Node 0: has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars
- Node 1: has 4 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars
- Node 3: has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star
- Node 5: has 5 neighbors, so it forms 10 3-stars
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star
- Node 7: has 6 neighbors, so it forms 20 3-stars
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star
- Node 10: has 4 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star
- Node 11: has 2 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star
- Node 12: has 2 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star
- Node 13: has 4 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star
- Node 14: has 3 neighbors, so it forms no 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 13>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 13>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 7, 10>
- <2, 3, 7>
- <2, 3, 13>
- <2, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 14>
- <3, 7, 14>
- <4, 6, 10>
- <4, 6, 13>
- <6, 10, 12>
- <7, 9, 14>
- <7, 10, 14>
- <8, 9, 13>
