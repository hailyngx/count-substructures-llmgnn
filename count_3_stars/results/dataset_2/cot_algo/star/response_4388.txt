Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {10, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 10, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 12, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 7, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 12, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9, 11}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 4, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 4, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 11, 14}: <5, (9, 11, 14)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {11, 13, 14}: <7, (11, 13, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 13, 14}: <12, (4, 13, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
