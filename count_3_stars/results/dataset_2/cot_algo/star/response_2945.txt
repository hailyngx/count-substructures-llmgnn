Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 16) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 26) (22, 17) (22, 6) (26, 8) (26, 28) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 27) (28, 26) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 4) (6, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 4) (5, 1) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 16) (7, 2) (7, 11) (1, 5) (1, 20) (1, 12) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 1) (20, 18) (20, 9) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 9) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 16) (23, 9) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 18) (29, 13) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 24) (9, 23) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 10) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 23) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to each node. 

For example:
- Node 3 is connected to 4 nodes: 15, 24, 10, and 19.
- Node 15 is connected to 5 nodes: 3, 14, 4, 17, and 16.
- Node 14 is connected to 6 nodes: 15, 17, 9, 16, 21, and 13.

We repeat this process for all nodes in the graph. After calculating the neighbor sets for all nodes, we identify the ones that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars they can form.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each eligible node:
- Node 14 forms 6 3-stars: <14, (15, 17, 16)>, <14, (15, 17, 21)>, <14, (15, 17, 13)>, <14, (15, 21, 16)>, <14, (15, 16, 21)>, <14, (17, 16, 21)>.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star: <16, (14, 10, 23)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
