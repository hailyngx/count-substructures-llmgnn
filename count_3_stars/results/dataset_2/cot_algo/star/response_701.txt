Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5, 8}

Next, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars:

- Node 4 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9} -> Inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 9 has neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5, 8} -> Inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Finally, summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us 30:
[30]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
