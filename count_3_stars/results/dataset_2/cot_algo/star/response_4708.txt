Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 60 \), which is written as [60]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 5, 6)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (8, 7, 9)>
- <4, (1, 7, 9)>
- <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- <4, (8, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (0, 7, 8)>
