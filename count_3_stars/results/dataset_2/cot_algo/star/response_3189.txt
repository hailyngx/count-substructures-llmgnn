Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 5, 7}

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars using the combinatorial calculation mentioned in the introduction \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- From Node 0: 1 combination
- From Node 1: 1 combination
- From Node 2: 1 combination
- From Node 3: 1 combination
- From Node 4: 1 combination
- From Node 5: 1 combination
- From Node 7: 1 combination
- From Node 8: 1 combination
- From Node 9: 1 combination

There is only 1 3-star formed with each of these nodes, as they have exactly 3 neighbors.

Adding the individual combinations, we get a total of 8 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are <0, 4, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 5>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 4, 7>, <2, 7, 8>, <3, 4, 7>, and <4, 7, 9>.
