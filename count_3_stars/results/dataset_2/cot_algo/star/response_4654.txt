Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, let's create a neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 8, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {8, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 12, 14}
- Node 7: {10, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 7, 9, 13}

Now, we'll check the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 0: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- Node 1: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 5: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 8: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 12: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 13: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 14: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)

Adding these up: 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 91

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [91].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 13>
<0, 8, 12>
<0, 13, 4>
<1, 3, 4>
<3, 6, 12>
<4, 11, 13>
<5, 8, 13>
<7, 10, 12>
<7, 10, 13>
<7, 12, 14>
<9, 11, 14>
<9, 13, 14>
