Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

For node 11: It has neighbors 15, 16, 20. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (15, 16, 20).
For node 16: It has neighbors 6, 11, 24. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 11, 24).
For node 21: It has neighbors 1, 7, 10, 14. So, it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 7: It has neighbors 21, 19, 28. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (21, 19, 28).
For node 3: It has neighbors 5, 13. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.
For node 23: It has neighbors 4, 18, 26. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 18, 26).
For node 29: It has neighbors 1, 7, 17, 27, 12. So, it forms 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
For node 0: It has neighbors 8, 17. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.
For node 14: It has neighbors 6, 9, 21. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (6, 9, 21).
For node 10: It has neighbors 15, 21, 22, 27. So, it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 15: It has neighbors 10, 11, 13, 22. So, it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 22: It has neighbors 2, 5, 10, 15. So, it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 20: It has neighbors 5, 11, 27. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 11, 27).
For node 2: It has neighbors 4, 6, 22, 28. So, it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 26: It has neighbors 18, 23. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.
For node 24: It has neighbors 12, 16, 25. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (12, 16, 25).
For node 4: It has neighbors 2, 23. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.
For node 27: It has neighbors 10, 20, 28, 29. So, it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 18: It has neighbors 13, 23, 25. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (13, 23, 25).
For node 6: It has neighbors 2, 14, 16. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (2, 14, 16).
For node 28: It has neighbors 2, 7, 19, 27. So, it forms 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
For node 12: It has neighbors 18, 24, 29. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (18, 24, 29).
For node 5: It has neighbors 3, 20, 22. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 20, 22).
For node 25: It has neighbors 18, 24. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.
For node 19: It has neighbors 7, 28. Since it has less than 3 neighbors, it doesn't form any 3-star.
For node 13: It has neighbors 3, 15, 18. So, it forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 15, 18).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1] = [48].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<15, 11, 20>, <6, 11, 24>, <21, 1, 7>, <21, 1, 10>, <21, 1, 14>, <21, 7, 10>, <21, 7, 14>, <21, 10, 14>, <7, 21, 19>, <7, 21, 28>, <7, 19, 28>, <3, 5, 20>, <4, 18, 23>, <29, 1, 7>, <29, 1, 17>, <29, 1, 27>, <29, 1, 12>, <29, 7, 17>, <29, 7, 27>, <29, 7, 12>, <29, 17, 27>, <29, 17, 12>, <29, 27, 12>, <6, 9, 21>, <10, 15, 21>, <10, 21, 22>, <10, 21, 27>, <15, 11, 22>, <15, 10, 22>, <15, 10, 13>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 4, 28>, <2, 6, 28>, <16, 24, 12>, <18, 13, 23>.
