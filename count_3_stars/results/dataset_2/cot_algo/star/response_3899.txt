Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 5, 8}

We can see that nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (0, 2, 4)>
- <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- <5, (0, 1, 6)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>
