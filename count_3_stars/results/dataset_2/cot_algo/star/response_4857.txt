Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 10) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 11, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 12, 13}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 8, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 6, 8, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 8, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 2, 7, 10}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 44, thus [44].

Unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 10)>
- <0, (3, 4, 14)>
- <0, (3, 9, 10)>
- <0, (3, 9, 14)>
- <0, (3, 10, 14)>
- <0, (4, 9, 10)>
- <0, (4, 9, 14)>
- <0, (4, 10, 14)>
- <3, (4, 7, 13)>
- <3, (7, 13, 14)>
- <4, (11, 13, 1)>
- <7, (13, 14, 10)>
