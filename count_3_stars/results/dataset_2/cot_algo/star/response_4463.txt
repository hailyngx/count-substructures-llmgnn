Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors [1, 2, 5, 9]
- Node 1: Neighbors [0, 2, 6, 7]
- Node 2: Neighbors [0, 1, 6, 7]
- Node 3: Neighbors [6, 7, 8]
- Node 4: Neighbors [5, 6, 7, 9]
- Node 5: Neighbors [0, 4, 8]
- Node 6: Neighbors [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
- Node 7: Neighbors [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]
- Node 8: Neighbors [3, 5, 7, 9]
- Node 9: Neighbors [0, 4, 8]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 and Node 1 have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each.
- Node 4 and Node 7 have 5 neighbors, so they can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 6)>
