Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 2, 4}
- Node 2: {6, 1, 4, 8, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 4, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {3, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 3, 2, 0}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 3, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 3, 0}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 53 \).
Therefore, the answer is [53].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (8, 9, 4)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 5)>, <4, (1, 6, 2)>, <4, (2, 6, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 5)>
