Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 5, 8}

Now, we look for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors, and calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 5C3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4C3 = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 40.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (8, 9, 1)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 5, 7)>
