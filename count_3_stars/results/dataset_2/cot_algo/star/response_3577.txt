Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 7, 14, 10, 6}
- Node 1: {8, 7, 11, 10, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 10, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 14, 5}
- Node 4: {8, 12, 5, 6, 3}
- Node 5: {13, 4, 2, 12, 3}
- Node 6: {4, 0}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {14, 1, 10, 2, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 9, 2}
- Node 11: {8, 12, 1, 9}
- Node 12: {4, 14, 5, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 0, 3, 9, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: In the neighbor set, it has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1: In the neighbor set, it has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2: In the neighbor set, it has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: In the neighbor set, it has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5: In the neighbor set, it has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9: In the neighbor set, it has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10: In the neighbor set, it has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 11: In the neighbor set, it has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 12: In the neighbor set, it has 4 neighbors, so it can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 14: In the neighbor set, it has 5 neighbors, so it can form [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 76

Therefore, the final answer is [76].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (8, 7, 14)>
<1, (8, 7, 10)>
<2, (5, 7, 10)>
<4, (8, 12, 5)>
<5, (13, 4, 2)>
<9, (14, 1, 10)>
<10, (0, 1, 9)>
<11, (8, 12, 1)>
<12, (4, 5, 6)>
<14, (13, 9, 12)>
