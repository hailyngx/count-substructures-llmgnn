Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 3) (9, 7) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 11) (27, 3) (27, 7) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 28) (22, 19) (22, 28) (22, 20) (23, 26) (23, 28) (1, 26) (1, 19) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 21) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 28) (14, 16) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 28) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 23) (28, 14) (28, 21) (17, 13) (17, 4) (2, 19) (2, 15) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (10, 26) (10, 6) (10, 24) (19, 22) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 18) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 11) (11, 27) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 18) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 15) (3, 9) (3, 27) (25, 9) (25, 24) (29, 16) (24, 10) (24, 25) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 12) (12, 5) (12, 20) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 29) (4, 0) (4, 17) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by first determining the neighbor set for each node. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {27, 21, 4, 14}
Node 1: {26, 19}
Node 2: {15, 19}
Node 3: {27, 9}
Node 4: {0, 17}
Node 5: {9, 12, 16, 14}
Node 6: {8, 10, 11}
Node 7: {27, 9, 11}
Node 8: {13, 6}
Node 9: {5, 25, 3, 7}
Node 10: {26, 6, 24}
Node 11: {27, 6, 7, 18}
Node 12: {5, 20}
Node 13: {8, 17, 15, 28}
Node 14: {5, 0, 28, 16}
Node 15: {13, 2, 18}
Node 16: {5, 14, 29}
Node 17: {13, 4}
Node 18: {19, 11, 15}
Node 19: {22, 1, 2, 18}
Node 20: {22, 26, 12}
Node 21: {0, 26, 28}
Node 22: {19, 28, 20}
Node 23: {26, 28}
Node 24: {10, 25}
Node 25: {9, 24}
Node 26: {23, 1, 10, 21, 14, 20}
Node 27: {0, 3, 7, 11}
Node 28: {22, 23, 13, 14, 21}
Node 29: {16}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 12, 16)>
<9, (5, 3, 7)>
<14, (0, 26, 28)>
<26, (23, 1, 20)>
<28, (22, 13, 21)>
