Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to each node. 

Here is the list of neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 1 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, 9
- Node 2 neighbors: 4, 7, 5, 1
- Node 3 neighbors: 6, 9
- Node 4 neighbors: 7, 9, 0, 1, 6, 2
- Node 5 neighbors: 6, 2, 8, 1, 0
- Node 6 neighbors: 4, 5, 1, 3
- Node 7 neighbors: 4, 9, 2, 8
- Node 8 neighbors: 7, 5, 1
- Node 9 neighbors: 4, 7, 1, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these together, we get a total of 54 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 0)>, <4, (7, 9, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 1)>, <4, (9, 0, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (2, 8, 1)>, <9, (4, 7, 1)>
