Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 1) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: {9, 13, 11, 1}
2. Node 1: {12, 10, 0}
3. Node 2: {9, 4, 7, 14}
4. Node 3: {8, 11, 14, 12}
5. Node 4: {7, 12, 13, 10, 2}
6. Node 5: {9, 12, 11, 14}
7. Node 6: {13, 11, 14}
8. Node 7: {4, 2}
9. Node 8: {9, 13, 10, 3}
10. Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 10, 0}
11. Node 10: {9, 4, 8, 1}
12. Node 11: {5, 13, 3, 0, 6}
13. Node 12: {4, 7, 3, 1, 5}
14. Node 13: {4, 8, 11, 0, 6}
15. Node 14: {5, 2, 3, 6}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors, calculate the number of 3-stars they form, and count the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 three-star: <0, 9, 13>
- Node 2 forms 1 three-star: <2, 9, 4>
- Node 3 forms 1 three-star: <3, 8, 14>
- Node 4 forms 1 three-star: <4, 7, 12>
- Node 5 forms 1 three-star: <5, 9, 12>
- Node 9 forms 1 three-star: <9, 5, 8>
- Node 10 forms 1 three-star: <10, 9, 4>
- Node 11 forms 1 three-star: <11, 5, 13>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
