Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 5) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors. 

Here are the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 12, 13, 2}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 0, 14, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 13, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 1, 10, 11, 7}
- Node 5: {6, 1, 3, 13, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 12}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 4, 14, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 11, 7, 5}
- Node 9: {6, 4, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {7, 4, 2}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 8, 4}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 0}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 0}
- Node 14: {7, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Forms 3-star with nodes (9, 12, 13), total 1 3-star.
- Node 1: Forms 3-star with nodes (3, 4, 5), total 1 3-star.
- Node 5: Forms 3-star with nodes (3, 2, 8), total 1 3-star.
- Node 4: Forms 3-star with nodes (1, 10, 11), total 1 3-star.
- Node 7: Forms 3-star with nodes (10, 11, 8), total 1 3-star.
- Node 2: Has exactly 3 neighbors, forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 5, 14).
- Node 3: Has exactly 3 neighbors, forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 5, 13).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 12, 13)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <5, (3, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 10, 11)>, <7, (10, 11, 8)>.
