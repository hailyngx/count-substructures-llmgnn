Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4, 14, 3
Node 1: 11, 8, 6, 12
Node 2: 5, 10, 4, 8, 13, 6
Node 3: 8, 0, 7, 13
Node 4: 10, 8, 2, 0
Node 5: 9, 2, 12, 14
Node 6: 10, 11, 2, 1, 13
Node 7: 9, 10, 3
Node 8: 4, 2, 12, 3, 1
Node 9: 5, 14, 7, 13
Node 10: 6, 7, 4, 2
Node 11: 14, 1, 6
Node 12: 5, 8, 1
Node 13: 9, 2, 3, 6
Node 14: 5, 9, 11, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 2 and Node 6 have 6 neighbors, so they each form \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.
Node 9 and Node 13 have 4 neighbors, so they each form \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars.
Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 10, Node 11, and Node 12 have less than 3 neighbors and do not form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (5, 10, 13)>
<2, (5, 12, 14)>
<2, (10, 13, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 10)>
<2, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (2, 8, 10)>
<2, (2, 8, 6)>
<6, (10, 11, 13)>
<6, (10, 1, 13)>
<6, (2, 11, 13)>
<6, (2, 1, 13)>
<9, (5, 14, 13)>
<9, (5, 9, 13)>
<9, (9, 14, 13)>
<9, (13, 9, 14)>
