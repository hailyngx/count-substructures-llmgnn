Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (16, 11) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 7) (10, 3) (10, 12) (4, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 18) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 7) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 3) (1, 7) (1, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 19) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can analyze the neighbors of each node to identify the 3-stars formed. 

Here is a list of the 3-stars found:
[44]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 17, 8)>
<1, (7, 12, 13)>
<2, (8, 18, 12)>
<3, (5, 10, 19)>
<5, (0, 17, 6)>
<9, (11, 8, 19)>
<12, (1, 7, 13)>
<14, (17, 6, 18)>
<15, (5, 7, 19)>
<16, (11, 9, 19)>
