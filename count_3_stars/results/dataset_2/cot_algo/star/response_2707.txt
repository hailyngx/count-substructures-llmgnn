Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 10) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 10, 6}
- Node 1: {9, 14, 12}
- Node 2: {5, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 3: {14, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 2, 4, 0}
- Node 6: {12, 0, 11}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 8: {9, 4, 2}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 11, 7, 1, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 0, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {9, 4, 7, 12, 2, 6}
- Node 12: {1, 14, 6, 11}
- Node 13: {5, 3, 7, 10}
- Node 14: {9, 1, 3, 12, 10}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 3: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 10: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 12: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 5, 10>
- <1, 9, 14>
- <2, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 11>
- <2, 5, 11>
- <2, 8, 11>
- <4, 8, 11>
- <5, 9, 13>
- <9, 11, 14>
- <9, 11, 7>
- <9, 11, 4>
- <9, 11, 2>
