Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (19, 14) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {11, 13, 14}
- Node 1 neighbors: {6, 7, 11}
- Node 2 neighbors: {12, 18}
- Node 3 neighbors: {12, 16}
- Node 4 neighbors: {5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 5 neighbors: {4, 6, 13, 18}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 5, 18}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 4, 9, 13, 17}
- Node 8 neighbors: {18}
- Node 9 neighbors: {7, 17}
- Node 10 neighbors: {11, 16}
- Node 11 neighbors: {0, 1, 10, 15}
- Node 12 neighbors: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 13 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 7, 14}
- Node 14 neighbors: {0, 13, 17, 19}
- Node 15 neighbors: {11}
- Node 16 neighbors: {3, 10, 17}
- Node 17 neighbors: {7, 9, 14, 16}
- Node 18 neighbors: {2, 5, 6, 8, 19}
- Node 19 neighbors: {14, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 13)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (4, 13, 18)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 9, 17)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (0, 1, 15)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (0, 7, 14)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (0, 17, 19)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (5, 6, 19)>
  
The total number of 3-stars formed is 7, so the final answer is [7].
