Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 12) (14, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 0) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 12) (0, 13) (0, 19) (10, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {13, 19}
- Node 1: {8, 12, 16}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {2, 5, 7, 13, 16}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 13, 15}
- Node 6: {10, 18, 19}
- Node 7: {3, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 8: {1, 16, 17}
- Node 9: {12, 18}
- Node 10: {6}
- Node 11: {7, 16}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 5, 19}
- Node 14: {19}
- Node 15: {5, 7, 17, 18}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 17: {8, 15}
- Node 18: {6, 9, 15}
- Node 19: {0, 6, 13, 14}

Now, we'll identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors

For the nodes listed above, we will calculate the possible 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

Thus, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 5, 13)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 15)>, 
<7, (3, 12, 15)>, 
<12, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<15, (5, 7, 17)>, 
<16, (1, 8, 11)>, 
<19, (0, 6, 13)>.
