Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 10) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to identify the number of 3-stars formed within the graph. Let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 7, 11, 1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 10, 12}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 12, 5, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 9, 7, 8, 0, 10}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 13, 12, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 10, 11, 4}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 0, 3, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 2, 14, 3}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 4, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 9, 4, 12, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 0, 12, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {2, 5, 10, 11, 1}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 2, 5}
- Node 14: Neighbors {8, 5, 11, 3}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars by considering the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10 + 10 = 20. 
Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [20].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <4, (6, 9, 10)>, <12, (2, 5, 11)>.
