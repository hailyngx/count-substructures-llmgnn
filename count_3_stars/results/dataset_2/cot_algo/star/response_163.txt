Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 24) (9, 20) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 3) (3, 26) (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 17) (4, 19) (4, 28) (7, 14) (7, 13) (25, 1) (1, 25) (1, 5) (1, 12) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 14) (27, 16) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 22) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 0) (20, 21) (2, 17) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 21) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 28) (6, 3) (6, 5) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 14) (22, 11) (8, 5) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (24, 9) (24, 0) (24, 11) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 28) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 11) (28, 17) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 14) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 28) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 8) (21, 20) (21, 18) (16, 27) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 10) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 22) (14, 10) (14, 29) (29, 27) (29, 14) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {16, 20, 22, 24}
- Node 1: {5, 12, 25}
- Node 2: {17}
- Node 3: {6, 15, 26}
- Node 4: {19, 28}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 8, 17, 28}
- Node 6: {3, 5}
- Node 7: {13, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 19, 23}
- Node 9: {18, 20, 24, 26}
- Node 10: {14, 15, 16}
- Node 11: {22, 24, 28}
- Node 12: {1, 19, 27}
- Node 13: {7}
- Node 14: {7, 10, 22, 27, 29}
- Node 15: {3, 10, 17}
- Node 16: {0, 10, 18, 27}
- Node 17: {2, 5, 15, 28}
- Node 18: {9, 16, 21}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 12}
- Node 20: {0, 9, 21, 26}
- Node 21: {18, 20}
- Node 22: {11, 14, 26}
- Node 23: {8}
- Node 24: {0, 9, 11}
- Node 25: {1}
- Node 26: {3, 9, 20, 22}
- Node 27: {12, 14, 16, 29}
- Node 28: {4, 5, 11, 17}
- Node 29: {14, 27}

Node 9, Node 14, and Node 26 have 4 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each.
Node 5, Node 16, and Node 17 have 5 neighbors each, so they can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.

Total number of 3-stars = \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 42 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [42], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (18, 20, 24)>, <9, (18, 20, 26)>, <9, (18, 24, 26)>, <9, (20, 24, 26)>, <14, (10, 22, 27)>, <14, (10, 27, 29)>, <14, (22, 27, 29)>, <14, (14, 22, 27)>, <26, (3, 20, 22)>, <26, (3, 20, 26)>, <26, (3, 22, 26)>, <26, (9, 20, 26)>, <5, (1, 8, 12)>, <5, (1, 8, 19)>, <5, (1, 12, 19)>, <5, (5, 8, 19)>, <16, (0, 10, 27)>, <16, (0, 16, 27)>, <16, (0, 18, 27)>, <16, (10, 18, 27)>, <17, (5, 15, 28)>, <17, (5, 17, 28)>, <17, (5, 28, 55)>, <17, (15, 17, 28)>
