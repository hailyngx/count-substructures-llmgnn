Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 21) (1, 14) (1, 24) (1, 23) (1, 27) (21, 22) (21, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (12, 11) (12, 27) (27, 1) (27, 12) (5, 6) (5, 26) (6, 21) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 24) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 5) (26, 2) (17, 11) (17, 29) (17, 8) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 18) (28, 13) (28, 3) (28, 7) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 4) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 20) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 18) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 23) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 16) (25, 19) (25, 29) (2, 22) (2, 6) (2, 26) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 10) (7, 28) (7, 15) (7, 23) (20, 9) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 7) (24, 1) (24, 14) (24, 19) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
1: 14, 24, 23, 27
2: 22, 6, 26
3: 6, 28, 23
4: 22, 6, 15
5: 6, 26
6: 21, 5, 3, 2, 4
7: 10, 28, 15, 23
8: 17, 9
9: 13, 10, 8, 20
10: 11, 0, 7, 9
11: 10, 12, 17
12: 11, 27
13: 22, 16, 28, 9, 23
14: 1, 0, 24
15: 7, 18, 4
16: 13, 0, 18
17: 11, 29, 8
18: 29, 15, 16
19: 25, 24
20: 9
21: 22, 6
22: 13, 2, 4, 21
23: 13, 1, 3, 7
24: 1, 14, 19
25: 19, 29
26: 5, 2
27: 1, 12
28: 13, 3, 7
29: 17, 25, 18

Now, let's look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.

Adding them up: \(10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 37\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].
