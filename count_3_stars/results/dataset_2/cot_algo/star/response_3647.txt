Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7}

Next, we will check each node to see if it can form any 3-stars:

- Node 0: Cannot form any 3-stars with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star <1, (2, 5, 9)>.
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star <2, (1, 5, 9)>.
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star <3, (1, 2, 9)>.
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star <4, (0, 6, 8)>.
- Node 5: Forms 1 3-star <5, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star <6, (0, 1, 9)>.
- Node 7: Cannot form any 3-stars with less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star <8, (0, 5, 6)>.
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star <9, (1, 2, 6)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed is 6, so the answer is [6].
