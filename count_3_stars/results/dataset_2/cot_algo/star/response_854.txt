Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {2, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 3, 7}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 2, Node 3, and Node 8 each have 5 neighbors, therefore each can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 4, Node 5, and Node 7 each have 4 neighbors, therefore each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [46], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 0, 3)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
