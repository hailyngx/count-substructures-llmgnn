Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 24) (1, 12) (21, 23) (21, 14) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 24) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 20) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 7) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 14) (25, 3) (25, 14) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 29) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 17) (2, 22) (18, 5) (18, 28) (19, 29) (19, 7) (19, 14) (26, 6) (26, 23) (26, 16) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 15) (28, 18) (28, 11) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 29) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 5) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 11) (22, 15) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 16) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 19) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 19) (29, 10) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 23) (5, 17) (14, 21) (14, 3) (14, 25) (14, 19) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 17) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 16) (20, 8) (20, 24) (24, 1) (24, 9) (24, 13) (24, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 1: {29, 24, 12}
- Node 2: {22}
- Node 3: {25, 7, 14}
- Node 4: {8, 22, 17}
- Node 5: {18, 15, 23, 17}
- Node 6: {9, 26, 16}
- Node 7: {13, 3, 19}
- Node 8: {9, 13, 4, 20}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 24}
- Node 10: {12, 15, 29}
- Node 11: {28, 22, 17, 15}
- Node 12: {1, 29, 10}
- Node 13: {8, 16, 24, 7}
- Node 14: {21, 3, 25, 19}
- Node 15: {11, 10, 22, 5}
- Node 16: {6, 13, 26, 23, 17}
- Node 17: {4, 11, 5, 16}
- Node 18: {5, 28}
- Node 19: {29, 7, 14}
- Node 20: {8, 24}
- Node 21: {23, 14}
- Node 22: {4, 2, 11, 15}
- Node 23: {21, 26, 5, 16}
- Node 24: {1, 9, 13, 20}
- Node 25: {3, 14}
- Node 26: {6, 23, 16}
- Node 28: {18, 11}
- Node 29: {1, 12, 19, 10}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3 and does not form any 3-star.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 49

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [49].
