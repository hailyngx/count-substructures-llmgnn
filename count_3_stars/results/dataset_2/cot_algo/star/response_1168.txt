Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first determine the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 2: 0, 5, 6
Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 2
Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 8: 1, 4, 9
Node 9: 3, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7. 3-star: <0, (1, 4, 7)>
Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7. 3-star: <1, (0, 4, 7)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3. 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 3)>
Node 9 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 2 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 5 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 8 does not form a 3-star as it does not have 3 or more neighbors.

There are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
