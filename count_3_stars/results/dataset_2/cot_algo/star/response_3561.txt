Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 4, 5} <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 5, 6} <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {3, 4, 7} <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 8, 2} <9, (4, 8, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, which is represented as [4].
