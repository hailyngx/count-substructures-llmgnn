Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are:
\[ V = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\} \]

And the edges are given as:
\[ E = \{(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 2), (1, 4), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 13), (2, 0), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 11), (3, 14), (4, 7), (4, 2), (4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 1), (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 12), (5, 14), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 0), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 2), (8, 13), (8, 0), (8, 12), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 14), (9, 3), (10, 4), (10, 13), (10, 14), (11, 3), (11, 13), (11, 12), (12, 5), (12, 11), (12, 8), (12, 14), (13, 10), (13, 11), (13, 8), (13, 2), (14, 5), (14, 9), (14, 4), (14, 10), (14, 3), (14, 12)\} \]

Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph.
