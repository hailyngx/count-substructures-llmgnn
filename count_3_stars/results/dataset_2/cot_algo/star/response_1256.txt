Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 8) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 10) (27, 13) (27, 8) (2, 12) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (8, 7) (8, 27) (8, 15) (8, 26) (23, 7) (23, 1) (28, 29) (28, 9) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 22) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 9) (26, 12) (26, 8) (6, 15) (21, 2) (21, 3) (21, 11) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 12) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 0) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 15) (1, 12) (1, 23) (1, 20) (1, 19) (19, 29) (19, 1) (22, 29) (22, 24) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 24) (10, 5) (10, 14) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 10) (11, 7) (11, 21) (11, 5) (11, 20) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 9) (9, 28) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 25) (14, 10) (20, 1) (20, 11) (5, 18) (5, 10) (5, 11) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 10, 17}
- Node 1: {12, 19, 20, 23}
- Node 2: {12, 17, 18, 21}
- Node 3: {0, 12, 16, 21}
- Node 5: {10, 11, 18}
- Node 6: {15}
- Node 7: {8, 11, 23}
- Node 8: {7, 15, 26, 27}
- Node 9: {13, 16, 25, 28}
- Node 10: {0, 5, 14, 24, 27}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 20, 21}
- Node 12: {1, 2, 3, 26}
- Node 13: {9, 17, 18, 27}
- Node 14: {10}
- Node 15: {6, 8, 17}
- Node 16: {3, 9, 25}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 13, 15}
- Node 18: {2, 5, 13}
- Node 19: {1, 29}
- Node 20: {1, 11}
- Node 21: {2, 3, 11}
- Node 22: {24, 29}
- Node 23: {1, 7}
- Node 24: {10, 16, 22}
- Node 25: {9, 16, 28}
- Node 26: {8, 12}
- Node 27: {8, 10, 13}
- Node 28: {9, 19, 25}
- Node 29: {19, 22}

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 22: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 28: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 29: No 3-star (has less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 23, 20>, <1, 23, 19>, <1, 12, 26>, <1, 12, 3>, <2, 21, 11>, <2, 18, 17>, <2, 18, 13>, <2, 17, 13>, <3, 21, 11>, <8, 27, 13>, <8, 27, 10>, <8, 27, 14>, <8, 26, 12>, <10, 27, 13>, <10, 27, 14>, <11, 21, 5>, <12, 26, 8>, <17, 0, 3>, <17, 0, 10>, <17, 0, 15>, <21, 3, 16>, <24, 10, 16>.
