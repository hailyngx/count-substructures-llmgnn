Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (10, 7) (17, 12) (17, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (4, 13) (4, 18) (0, 9) (0, 6) (14, 9) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {9, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {3, 2, 19}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 8, 18, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {16, 5, 1, 6, 18}
- Node 4: neighbors {13, 18}
- Node 5: neighbors {19, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 6: neighbors {11, 3, 0}
- Node 7: neighbors {5, 8, 10, 2}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 7}
- Node 9: neighbors {15, 14, 0}
- Node 10: neighbors {7}
- Node 11: neighbors {16, 19, 13, 6}
- Node 12: neighbors {5, 17, 18}
- Node 13: neighbors {11, 4}
- Node 14: neighbors {9}
- Node 15: neighbors {16, 9, 17}
- Node 16: neighbors {11, 15, 3, 18}
- Node 17: neighbors {12, 15}
- Node 18: neighbors {16, 3, 2, 4, 12}
- Node 19: neighbors {11, 5, 1}

Next, let's find the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 5 neighbors
- Node 19: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{n}{3} \]

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 44

Listing unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 2, 19)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 12)>, <1, (3, 18, 12)>, <1, (5, 7, 12)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 12)>, <2, (18, 4, 12)>, <3, (16, 18, 12)>, <5, (19, 1, 11)>, <7, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (15, 17, 12)>, <11, (16, 15, 3)>, <12, (5, 17, 18)>, <16, (15, 17, 12)>, <18, (3, 2, 4)>
