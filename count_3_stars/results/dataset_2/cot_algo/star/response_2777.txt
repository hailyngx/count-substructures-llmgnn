Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (11, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 19) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 13) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 13) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 18) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a graph format:

```
10---2       11---19
|              |
4---8---0   15---19
|   |       |    |
13  14   7---16  9
|   |   |    |   |
 \  |   |    |   |
   5---6---1   18
    \  |
      17
```

Next, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {7, 12, 13, 16, 18}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 17}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 14}
- Node 7: {3, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 15}
- Node 9: {0, 19}
- Node 10: {2}
- Node 11: {19}
- Node 12: {2, 3}
- Node 13: {3, 4, 16, 18, 19}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 15: {7, 8, 16, 19}
- Node 16: {3, 7, 13, 15, 17}
- Node 17: {5, 16, 18}
- Node 18: {3, 13, 17}
- Node 19: {9, 11, 13, 15}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 41 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [41]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (7, 13, 16)>
- <4, (8, 13, 14)>
- <6, (1, 5, 14)>
- <7, (3, 14, 15)>
- <8, (0, 4, 15)>
- <13, (3, 16, 19)>
- <15, (7, 16, 19)>
- <16, (3, 13, 17)>
- <17, (5, 16, 18)>
- <18, (3, 13, 17)>
