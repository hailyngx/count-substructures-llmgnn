Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9.

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>

<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
