Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0: Neighbors {1, 5, 6}
Node 1: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 7, 8}
Node 3: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 9}
Node 4: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 5}
Node 5: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7}
Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 8, 9}
Node 7: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 9}
Node 8: Neighbors {2, 6, 9}
Node 9: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7, 8}
  
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 3: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 6: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-stars
Node 9: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 45\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>
