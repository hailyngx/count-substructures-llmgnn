Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 5, 7}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 2: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 7}
- Node 5: neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {0, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: neighbors {2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
- Node 1: has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
- Node 7: has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
- Node 8: has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <2, 3, 8>
- <5, 6, 9>
- <7, 8, 9> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is [50].
