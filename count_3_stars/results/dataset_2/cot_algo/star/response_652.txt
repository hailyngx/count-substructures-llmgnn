Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
In this case, we first need to determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2: 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 2, 3, 7

Nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28 3-stars. So, the final answer will be [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
