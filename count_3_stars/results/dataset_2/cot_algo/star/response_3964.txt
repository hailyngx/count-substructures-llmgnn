Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 0) (16, 11) (9, 26) (9, 20) (9, 10) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 2) (13, 4) (13, 29) (22, 11) (22, 27) (2, 26) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 28) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 28) (7, 18) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 15) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 0) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 3) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 17) (1, 26) (1, 4) (1, 19) (5, 6) (5, 28) (5, 27) (6, 21) (6, 5) (6, 25) (28, 2) (28, 29) (28, 5) (28, 3) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 24) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 28) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 25) (25, 6) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 14) (10, 9) (10, 14) (12, 25) (23, 26) (23, 25) (23, 24) (23, 27) (14, 11) (14, 25) (14, 10) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 19) (19, 1) (19, 24) (27, 22) (27, 5) (27, 23) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {11, 18, 24}
- Node 1: {4, 19, 26}
- Node 2: {8, 26, 28, 29}
- Node 3: {20, 21, 28}
- Node 4: {13, 17, 18, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 27, 28}
- Node 6: {5, 21, 25}
- Node 7: {18}
- Node 8: {2, 17, 24}
- Node 9: {10, 20, 26}
- Node 10: {9, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 14, 16, 22}
- Node 12: {25}
- Node 13: {4, 29}
- Node 14: {10, 11, 25}
- Node 15: {17, 20, 21}
- Node 16: {11}
- Node 17: {15, 25, 4, 8}
- Node 18: {0, 4, 7}
- Node 19: {1, 24}
- Node 20: {3, 9, 15}
- Node 21: {3, 6, 15}
- Node 22: {11, 27}
- Node 23: {24, 25, 26, 27}
- Node 24: {0, 8, 19, 23}
- Node 25: {6, 12, 14, 17, 23}
- Node 26: {2, 9, 23, 1}
- Node 27: {22, 23, 5}
- Node 28: {2, 3, 5, 29}
- Node 29: {2, 13, 28}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (8, 28, 29)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (20, 21, 28)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 17, 18)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 27, 28)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (2, 17, 24)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (10, 20, 26)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (14, 16, 22)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (10, 11, 25)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (4, 8, 15)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star: <21, (3, 15, 20)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star: <23, (24, 25, 26)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star: <24, (8, 19, 23)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star: <25, (6, 14, 17, 23)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star: <26, (9, 23, 1)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star: <28, (3, 5, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
