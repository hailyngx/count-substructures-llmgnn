Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 0) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {11, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 5: {4, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 13, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 2, 3, 9}
- Node 12: {5, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 7, 8, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 7, 12}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes {1, 11, 13}
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 13, 6}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 12, 14}
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {8, 10, 9}
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes {13, 14, 0}
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes {12, 13, 6}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 10, 11}
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 12, 8}
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 12, 7}

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars.
The final number of 3-stars is [9].
