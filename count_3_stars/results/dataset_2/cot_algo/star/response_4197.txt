Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, we can construct the following neighbor sets for each node:
1. Node 0: {2, 4, 7}
2. Node 1: {2, 4, 7, 8}
3. Node 2: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
4. Node 3: {5, 7, 8, 9}
5. Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
6. Node 5: {3, 7, 8, 9}
7. Node 6: {4}
8. Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
9. Node 8: {1, 2, 3, 5}
10. Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}

There are no nodes with less than 3 neighbors. Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node.
1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
2. Node 1: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
3. Node 2: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)
4. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
5. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)
6. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
7. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)
8. Node 8: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
9. Node 9: \( \binom{5}{2} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 6 + 10 + 6 + 10 + 6 + 10 + 6 + 10 = 67

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [67], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 7>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 5, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 9>, <7, 8, 9>
