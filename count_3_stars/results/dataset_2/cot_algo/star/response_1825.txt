Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list down the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 1: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 5, 6

Nodes 5 and 9 have 4 neighbors each, therefore we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with each of these nodes. So far, we have 8 3-stars.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars:
<5, 2, 6>, <5, 2, 9>, <5, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 9>, <9, 1, 6>, <1, 7, 8>, <0, 3, 4>, <0, 3, 8>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
