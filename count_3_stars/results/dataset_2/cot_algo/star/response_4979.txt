Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 0) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (10, 13) (10, 7) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {8, 13, 6, 5, 0}
- Node 2: Neighbors {14, 7, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {13, 9, 0}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 11, 14, 7, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7, 12}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 11, 14, 10, 2, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 12, 0, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {8, 13, 4, 12}
- Node 10: Neighbors {13, 7}
- Node 11: Neighbors {13, 14, 7, 5, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {8, 9, 6, 11, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 9, 1, 10, 11}
- Node 14: Neighbors {11, 7, 12, 2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 88

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [88].

The unique 3-stars found are:
