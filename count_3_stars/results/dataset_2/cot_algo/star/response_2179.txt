Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 19) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 16) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 15) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 14) (8, 6) (16, 14) (16, 18) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 17) (9, 7) (9, 10) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 1) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

1: {7, 10}
2: {0, 7}
3: {0, 4, 5}
4: {3, 5, 6}
5: {3, 4, 19}
6: {4, 8, 18}
7: {1, 2, 9, 10, 12}
8: {6, 14}
9: {7, 10}
10: {1, 7, 9}
11: {13, 14, 17}
12: {7, 19}
13: {11, 15, 17}
14: {0, 8, 11, 16}
15: {13, 17, 19}
16: {14, 18}
17: {0, 11, 13, 15}
18: {6, 16}
19: {5, 12, 15}

Nodes with three or more neighbors are:
7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 12: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- For node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<7, (1, 9, 10)>
<3, (4, 5, 19)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 19)>
<6, (4, 8, 18)>
<11, (13, 17, 19)>
<13, (11, 15, 17)>
<14, (8, 11, 16)>
<17, (11, 13, 15)>
