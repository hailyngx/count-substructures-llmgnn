Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (8, 4) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (16, 3) (12, 13) (12, 16) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 16) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 7, 15, 18}
- Node 1: {13, 15, 16, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 15}
- Node 3: {4, 5, 9, 16}
- Node 4: {3, 8, 10, 17}
- Node 5: {3, 13, 18}
- Node 6: {19}
- Node 7: {0, 11, 15}
- Node 8: {4}
- Node 9: {2, 3}
- Node 10: {4, 14}
- Node 11: {7, 14}
- Node 12: {13, 16}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 12, 19}
- Node 14: {10, 11, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 16: {1, 3, 12}
- Node 17: {1, 4, 14}
- Node 18: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 19: {6, 13, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 7, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the final answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 7, 15>
<1, 13, 15, 16>
<3, 4, 5, 16>
<4, 10, 14, 17>
<5, 13, 18>
<7, 11, 14>
<13, 1, 19>
<14, 10, 17>
<15, 0, 2>
<16, 1, 12>
<17, 1, 14>
<18, 0, 5>
<19, 6, 13>
