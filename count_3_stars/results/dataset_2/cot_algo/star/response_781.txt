Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (17, 1) (17, 5) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 18) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 18) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (6, 15) (6, 19) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (4, 11) (4, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {15, 7, 12, 2}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {17, 14, 18}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {13, 0}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {15, 11, 7}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {11, 16}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {17, 19, 18}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {15, 19}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {3, 15, 0}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {10, 11, 13}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {15, 14, 16}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {11, 8, 13}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {3, 10, 8, 4}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {14, 0, 18}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {10, 8, 2, 19}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {12, 1, 9}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {3, 7, 9, 6}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {9, 4}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {1, 5}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {12, 1, 5}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {13, 5, 6}

Now, we need to check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
2. Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
6. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
7. Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
8. Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
9. Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
10. Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
11. Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
12. Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
13. Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
14. Node 16: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
15. Node 17: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
16. Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
17. Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
