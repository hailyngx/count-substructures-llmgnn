Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 1) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 12) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {6, 7, 10, 14, 4}
- Node 1: Neighbors {10, 5, 8, 4}
- Node 2: Neighbors {7, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {14, 11, 7, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {6, 0, 2, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {11, 2, 12, 8, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 4, 0, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {9, 0, 3, 10, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {11, 5, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 14, 10, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 0, 14, 7, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors {3, 13, 5, 8}
- Node 12: Neighbors {3, 13, 5}
- Node 13: Neighbors {6, 11, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {9, 0, 3, 10}

Next, let's identify nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed from each:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 14

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 65 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 65. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 4, 6>, <0, 1, 4>, <0, 10, 7>, <0, 10, 14>, <0, 5, 4>, <1, 5, 10>, <2, 4, 5>, <3, 7, 14>, <3, 5, 11>, <6, 13, 11>, <7, 9, 10>, <7, 2, 5>, <9, 6, 13>, <14, 3, 10>, <14, 9, 0>
