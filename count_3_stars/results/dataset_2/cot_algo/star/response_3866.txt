Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 2, 3, 6
Node 1: 5, 6, 9
Node 2: 0, 8, 9
Node 3: 0, 6, 9
Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up: 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 44.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
