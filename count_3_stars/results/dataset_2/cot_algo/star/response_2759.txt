Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 14) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 13) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (10, 16) (10, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (19, 15) (19, 7) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {14}
- Node 1: {11, 6, 14}
- Node 2: {11, 4, 5, 17}
- Node 4: {6, 8, 5, 2}
- Node 5: {4, 12, 2}
- Node 6: {1, 18, 8, 4}
- Node 7: {8, 19, 18}
- Node 8: {6, 10, 7, 4}
- Node 9: {11, 16, 13}
- Node 10: {16, 8}
- Node 11: {16, 14, 1, 9, 2}
- Node 12: {5, 13}
- Node 13: {9, 17, 12}
- Node 14: {11, 15, 0, 1}
- Node 15: {14, 19, 18}
- Node 16: {11, 18, 9, 10}
- Node 17: {13, 2}
- Node 18: {16, 15, 6, 7}
- Node 19: {15, 7}

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation to nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <1, (11, 6, 14)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <2, (11, 4, 5)>, <2, (11, 4, 17)>, <2, (4, 5, 17)>, <2, (5, 12, 13)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <4, (6, 8, 5)>, <4, (6, 8, 2)>, <4, (6, 2, 17)>, <4, (8, 5, 2)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <5, (4, 12, 13)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <6, (1, 18, 8)>, <6, (1, 18, 4)>, <6, (1, 8, 4)>, <6, (18, 8, 4)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <8, (6, 10, 7)>, <8, (6, 10, 18)>, <8, (6, 7, 18)>, <8, (10, 7, 18)>
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <11, (16, 9, 14)>, <11, (16, 1, 14)>, <11, (16, 1, 6)>, <11, (16, 1, 2)>, <11, (9, 1, 2)>, <11, (14, 15, 0)>, <11, (14, 15, 1)>, <11, (15, 0, 1)>, <11, (15, 0, 14)>, <11, (15, 1, 14)>
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <13, (9, 12, 17)>
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <14, (11, 15, 0)>, <14, (11, 15, 1)>, <14, (11, 0, 1)>, <14, (15, 0, 1)>
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <15, (14, 19, 18)>
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <16, (18, 9, 10)>, <16, (18, 9, 8)>, <16, (18, 10, 8)>, <16, (9, 10, 8)>
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <18, (16, 15, 7)>, <18, (16, 15, 19)>, <18, (16, 7, 19)>, <18, (15, 7, 19)>

Adding up all the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 41 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [41].
