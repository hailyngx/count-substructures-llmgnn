Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {6, 10, 14}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {4, 9, 10}
- Node 12: {3, 8}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 88

Therefore, the final answer is [88].

And the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 9, 13)>
<3, (6, 10, 13)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 10)>
<8, (0, 3, 12)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<10, (1, 6, 13)>
<13, (1, 3, 10)>
