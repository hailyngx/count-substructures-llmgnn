Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 4, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 65\).

Thus, the final answer is [65], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 9, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>
