Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 18) (16, 12) (9, 5) (9, 3) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 21) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 28) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (20, 4) (20, 6) (17, 3) (17, 23) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 8) (21, 26) (21, 28) (28, 5) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 19) (1, 26) (1, 24) (1, 27) (22, 11) (22, 26) (22, 12) (22, 25) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 23) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 29) (7, 0) (7, 19) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 6) (23, 13) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 27) (27, 1) (27, 25) (27, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (24, 1) (24, 6) (24, 19) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 28) (8, 3) (12, 16) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 18) (2, 5) (2, 27) (19, 28) (19, 7) (19, 24) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 18) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 14) (4, 20) (4, 0) (13, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {24, 26, 27}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 27}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8, 9, 10, 17}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 20}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 9, 28}
- Node 6: Neighbors {20, 23, 24}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 19, 29}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 8, 15, 28, 29}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 3, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {18, 22, 23}
- Node 12: Neighbors {14, 16, 18, 22}
- Node 13: Neighbors {23}
- Node 14: Neighbors {10, 12, 18}
- Node 15: Neighbors {8, 18, 25}
- Node 16: Neighbors {12}
- Node 17: Neighbors {3, 23}
- Node 18: Neighbors {11, 12, 14, 15}
- Node 19: Neighbors {7, 24, 28}
- Node 20: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 21: Neighbors {26, 28}
- Node 22: Neighbors {11, 12, 22, 25, 26}
- Node 23: Neighbors {6, 11, 13, 17}
- Node 24: Neighbors {1, 6, 19}
- Node 25: Neighbors {15, 22, 27}
- Node 26: Neighbors {1, 21, 22, 26}
- Node 27: Neighbors {1, 2, 25}
- Node 28: Neighbors {5, 8, 19, 21, 29}
- Node 29: Neighbors {7, 8, 28}

Now we can identify the 3-stars:
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {18, 22, 23}: <11, (18, 22, 23)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {8, 18, 25}: <15, (8, 18, 25)>

Since there are 2 unique 3-stars identified, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
