Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 17) (26, 3) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (10, 17) (10, 22) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (8, 27) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (29, 25) (29, 17) (29, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 24) (16, 6) (16, 23) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 25) (19, 18) (19, 24) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 20) (12, 15) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (13, 21) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (27, 8) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 18) (23, 20) (20, 9) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 23) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 14) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the provided edge list:

- Node 0: {1, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 13}
- Node 3: {2, 11, 25, 26}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 24}
- Node 6: {5, 16, 21}
- Node 7: {5, 8, 24}
- Node 8: {7, 27}
- Node 9: {15, 20, 22}
- Node 10: {17, 22}
- Node 11: {3, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 15, 20, 22}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 2, 21}
- Node 14: {11, 15, 18, 25}
- Node 15: {9, 12, 14, 18}
- Node 16: {6, 23}
- Node 17: {10, 23, 26, 29}
- Node 18: {14, 15, 19, 23, 29}
- Node 19: {18, 24, 25}
- Node 20: {9, 12, 20, 28}
- Node 21: {6, 13, 28}
- Node 22: {9, 10, 12}
- Node 23: {16, 17, 18, 20, 25}
- Node 24: {5, 7, 19}
- Node 25: {3, 14, 19, 23, 29}
- Node 26: {3, 17}
- Node 27: {8}
- Node 28: {21, 20}
- Node 29: {17, 18, 25}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of unique 3-stars formed by each node. 

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 22, Node 26
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 3, Node 15
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: Node 18, Node 25

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 22: 1 3-star (it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 26: 1 3-star (it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<22, 9, 10, 12>, <26, 3, 17, 29>, <3, 11, 25, 14>, <3, 25, 18, 29>, <3, 2, 12, 13>, <15, 9, 12, 18>, <18, 14, 15, 25>, <18, 19, 23, 29>, <18, 23, 20, 25>, <18, 23, 29, 25>
