Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 9) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 4) (12, 18) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 17) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 17) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 6) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 14) (10, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 5, 16, 17}
- Node 1: {2, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 13, 15, 16}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {12, 18, 19}
- Node 5: {0, 14, 18}
- Node 6: {7, 15, 17}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 9, 10, 17}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 19}
- Node 9: {7, 14, 18, 19}
- Node 10: {7}
- Node 11: {1}
- Node 12: {4, 18}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 18}
- Node 14: {5, 9}
- Node 15: {2, 6}
- Node 16: {0, 2}
- Node 17: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 18: {4, 5, 9, 12, 13, 19}
- Node 19: {4, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 forms 1 3-star
- Node 15 forms 1 3-star
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star
- Node 17 forms 1 3-star
- Node 18 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 19 forms 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 48

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 16, 17)>
<2, (1, 13, 16)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 10, 17)>
<8, (1, 19, 3)>
<9, (7, 14, 18)>
<13, (2, 3, 18)>
<15, (2, 6, 17)>
<16, (0, 2, 17)>
<17, (0, 6, 7)>
<18, (4, 9, 13)>
<19, (4, 8, 9)>
