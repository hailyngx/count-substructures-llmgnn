Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {18, 26}
- Node 1: {5, 22}
- Node 2: {4, 12, 20, 24}
- Node 4: {2, 8, 10, 22}
- Node 5: {1, 10, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 6: {14, 15, 20}
- Node 7: {13}
- Node 8: {4, 11, 16, 18}
- Node 9: {13, 17, 21, 24}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 17}
- Node 11: {8, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 11, 15, 29}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 23, 24}
- Node 14: {5, 6, 11}
- Node 15: {5, 6, 12}
- Node 16: {5, 8, 28}
- Node 17: {9, 10, 28}
- Node 18: {0, 8, 20, 23}
- Node 19: {28}
- Node 20: {2, 6, 18, 21, 26}
- Node 21: {9, 20, 22}
- Node 22: {4, 1, 21}
- Node 23: {13, 18, 24, 25, 26}
- Node 24: {2, 9, 13, 23}
- Node 25: {23}
- Node 26: {0, 20, 23, 29}
- Node 28: {16, 17, 19}
- Node 29: {12, 26}

Next, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 75.

So, the final number of 3-stars is [75].
