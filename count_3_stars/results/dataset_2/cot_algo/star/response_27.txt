Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 22) (15, 25) (15, 24) (6, 9) (6, 26) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 25) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 29) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 5) (12, 10) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 17) (19, 8) (19, 20) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 5) (26, 2) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 4) (17, 27) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 0) (25, 15) (25, 7) (16, 29) (16, 23) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 14) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 24) (22, 3) (22, 4) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 0) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 8) (14, 28) (14, 8) (14, 2) (29, 10) (29, 16) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (18, 12) (18, 13) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 2) (20, 23) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 20) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 13, 17}
- Node 1: {4, 24, 28}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 14, 20, 26}
- Node 3: {6, 9, 22}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 13, 17, 22, 27}
- Node 5: {2, 11, 26}
- Node 6: {3, 9, 26}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3} = 4] 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3} = 10] 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it forms [inom{6}{3} = 20] 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (2, 13, 17)>
- <0, (2, 13, 4)>
- <0, (2, 17, 4)>
- <0, (13, 17, 4)>
- <2, (0, 5, 20)>
- <2, (0, 5, 14)>
- <2, (0, 5, 26)>
- <2, (0, 14, 26)>
- <2, (5, 14, 26)>
- <0, (4, 1, 17)>
- <0, (4, 1, 24)>
- <0, (1, 17, 24)>
- <1, (4, 17, 24)>
- <0, (4, 27, 17)>
- <0, (4, 13, 27)>
- <0, (13, 17, 27)>
- <4, (13, 17, 27)>
- <2, (0, 5, 26)>
- <2, (0, 14, 26)>
- <2, (5, 14, 26)>
- <4, (1, 17, 27)>
- <4, (13, 17, 27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].
