Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 20) (6, 13) (6, 21) (9, 2) (9, 15) (1, 7) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 16) (14, 21) (17, 13) (17, 25) (21, 6) (21, 14) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 3) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 15) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 15) (18, 21) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 0) (26, 11) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 8) (7, 1) (7, 11) (25, 17) (25, 24) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 0) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 10) (19, 4) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 11) (2, 9) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 27) (12, 28) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 24) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 4) (10, 29) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 24) (24, 25) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 5) (4, 19) (4, 10) (29, 10) (29, 0) (0, 18) (0, 23) (0, 29) (20, 22) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 16) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 20) (27, 28) (27, 2) (27, 10) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {18, 23, 29}
Node 1: {7}
Node 2: {5, 9, 12, 15, 23, 27}
Node 3: {16, 20, 28}
Node 4: {10, 19}
Node 5: {2, 12, 24}
Node 6: {13, 21}
Node 7: {1, 11}
Node 8: {10, 24, 26}
Node 9: {2, 15}
Node 10: {4, 8, 10, 26, 27, 29}
Node 11: {7, 15, 23, 26}
Node 12: {2, 5, 24, 28}
Node 13: {6, 17, 22}
Node 14: {21}
Node 15: {2, 11, 15, 28}
Node 16: {3, 20, 22}
Node 17: {13, 25}
Node 18: {0, 20, 21, 26}
Node 19: {4}
Node 20: {3, 16, 18, 22}
Node 21: {6, 14, 18, 21, 28}
Node 22: {13, 16, 20}
Node 23: {0, 2, 11}
Node 24: {5, 8, 12, 24, 25}
Node 25: {17, 24}
Node 26: {8, 10, 11, 18, 26}
Node 27: {2, 10, 27, 28}
Node 28: {3, 12, 15, 21, 27}
Node 29: {0, 10}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

Node 2 forms a 3-star with {5, 12, 15}.
Node 10 forms a 3-star with {4, 8, 10}.
Node 15 forms a 3-star with {11, 15, 28}.
Node 26 forms a 3-star with {18, 26, 28}.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are: 
<2, (5, 12, 15)>, 
<10, (4, 8, 10)>, 
<15, (11, 15, 28)>,
<26, (18, 26, 28)>.
