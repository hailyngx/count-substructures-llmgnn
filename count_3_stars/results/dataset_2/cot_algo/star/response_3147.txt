Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {0, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 9}
- Node 1: Forms two 3-stars with neighbors {2, 5, 6} and {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 6, 4}
- Node 3: No 3-star formed
- Node 4: No 3-star formed
- Node 5: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 7}
- Node 6: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 7} and {3, 9, 2}
- Node 7: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: No 3-star formed
- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 5, 6}

Total number of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
