Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 2) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 5) (18, 1) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 8) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 5) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 4) (8, 12) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 8) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 8) (4, 10) (4, 15) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5}
- Node 1: {13, 17, 18, 19}
- Node 2: {5, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {8, 9, 14}
- Node 4: {10, 15}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 19}
- Node 7: {5, 12, 15}
- Node 8: {3, 12, 15, 19}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 10, 17}
- Node 10: {4, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {12}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 18}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 10, 17}
- Node 15: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 16: {2, 19}
- Node 17: {1, 2, 9, 14}
- Node 18: {1, 13}
- Node 19: {1, 6, 8, 16}

Now, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {13, 17, 18}
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 7, 13}

Counting these unique 3-stars gives us a total of [2]. Thus, the final answer is [2].
