Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 21) (4, 21) (4, 25) (7, 9) (7, 28) (12, 13) (12, 8) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 1) (2, 18) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 6) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 11) (20, 18) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 28) (14, 0) (14, 3) (8, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (22, 26) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 16) (17, 6) (29, 24) (29, 11) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 21) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 23) (25, 4) (25, 1) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 22) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 23) (11, 0) (11, 29) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 5) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 21) (13, 12) (13, 21) (13, 28) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 15) (21, 23) (21, 13) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 14) (3, 8) (5, 24) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 13) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {20, 14, 10, 11, 16}
- Node 1 neighbors: {27, 15, 6, 25, 16}
- Node 2 neighbors: {18, 3}
- Node 3 neighbors: {2, 20, 14, 8}
- Node 4 neighbors: {21, 25}
- Node 5 neighbors: {24}
- Node 6 neighbors: {18, 17, 1, 23}
- Node 7 neighbors: {9, 28}
- Node 8 neighbors: {12, 22, 3}
- Node 9 neighbors: {26, 7, 23, 19}
- Node 10 neighbors: {27, 0, 23}
- Node 11 neighbors: {0, 29}
- Node 12 neighbors: {13, 8}
- Node 13 neighbors: {12, 21, 28}
- Node 14 neighbors: {0, 3}
- Node 15 neighbors: {1, 21}
- Node 16 neighbors: {0, 22, 1}
- Node 17 neighbors: {6}
- Node 18 neighbors: {2, 19, 20, 6}
- Node 19 neighbors: {18, 22, 9}
- Node 20 neighbors: {18, 0, 3, 28}
- Node 21 neighbors: {4, 26, 15, 23, 13}
- Node 22 neighbors: {26, 8, 19, 16}
- Node 23 neighbors: {9, 6, 10, 21}
- Node 24 neighbors: {27, 29, 5}
- Node 25 neighbors: {4, 1}
- Node 26 neighbors: {9, 22, 21}
- Node 27 neighbors: {24, 10, 1}
- Node 28 neighbors: {7, 20, 13}
- Node 29 neighbors: {24, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with neighbors {14, 3, 28} <0, (14, 3, 28)>.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {15, 21, 27} <1, (15, 21, 27)>.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 14, 8} <3, (2, 14, 8)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {18, 1, 23} <6, (18, 1, 23)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {7, 19, 23} <9, (7, 19, 23)>.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 0, 1} <16, (22, 0, 1)>.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 6, 19} <18, (2, 6, 19)>.
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with neighbors {3, 0, 28} <20, (3, 0, 28)>.
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 15, 13} <21, (4, 15, 13)>.
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 19, 16} <22, (8, 19, 16)>.

Total number of 3-stars = 10, so the answer is [10].
