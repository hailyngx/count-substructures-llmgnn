Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 7, 13}
- Node 1: {8, 2, 14, 10}
- Node 2: {5, 7, 1}
- Node 3: {9, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 9, 12, 14, 6}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 4, 0}
- Node 6: {7, 12, 14, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 10, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 10, 3, 4}
- Node 10: {9, 8, 3, 1, 12}
- Node 11: {12, 14, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 6, 11}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 11, 6}
- Node 14: {11, 4, 6, 1}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (5, 7, 13)>, <1, (8, 2, 14)>, <4, (5, 9, 12)>, <5, (9, 8, 4)>, <6, (7, 12, 14)>, <9, (5, 8, 10)>, <10, (9, 8, 3)>, <12, (4, 10, 6)>, <13, (0, 3, 11)>, <14, (11, 4, 6)>
