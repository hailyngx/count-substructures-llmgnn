Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 10, 11, 12
- Node 1: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 10, 14
- Node 4: 5, 8, 11, 12, 13
- Node 5: 4, 10, 12, 13
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 2, 13
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 9, 14
- Node 9: 2, 8, 10, 14
- Node 10: 0, 3, 5, 9
- Node 11: 0, 4, 13
- Node 12: 0, 4, 5, 13
- Node 13: 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 14
- Node 14: 3, 8, 9, 13

Next, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors
- Node 10: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 6 neighbors
- Node 14: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, 11, 12>
- <0, 11, 13>
- <0, 11, 4>
- <0, 11, 5>
- <0, 12, 13>
- <0, 12, 4>
- <0, 12, 5>
- <0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 8>
- <1, 3, 6>
- <1, 3, 10>
- <1, 3, 14>
- <1, 6, 8>
- <2, 8, 14>
- <4, 11, 13>
- <5, 10, 12>
- <5, 10, 13>
- <5, 12, 13>
- <8, 2, 9>
- <13, 11, 14>
