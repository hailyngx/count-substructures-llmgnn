Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 16) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 7) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (5, 15) (5, 19) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 16) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 7) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 8) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 14, 8}
- Node 1: {9, 13, 19}
- Node 2: {15, 14, 17}
- Node 3: {15, 0, 10, 9}
- Node 4: {10, 13, 12}
- Node 5: {15, 19}
- Node 6: {16}
- Node 7: {18, 19, 16}
- Node 8: {10, 18, 0, 17}
- Node 9: {3, 11, 1}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 4}
- Node 11: {9, 13}
- Node 12: {13, 4, 16}
- Node 13: {11, 4, 1, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 0}
- Node 15: {3, 5, 2, 16}
- Node 16: {6, 15, 12, 7}
- Node 17: {2, 19, 8}
- Node 18: {7, 8}
- Node 19: {5, 7, 17, 1}

Now let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-star graph configurations:

- Node 0, Node 8, Node 13, and Node 15 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars each.
- Node 3, Node 9, Node 10, Node 16, and Node 19 each have 3 neighbors, so they can form 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star each.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 4 * 4 + 5 * 1 = 16 + 5 = 21.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the provided graph is [21].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
- <0, 3, 8, 14>
- <0, 3, 8, 17>
- <0, 3, 10, 8>
- <0, 8, 14, 17>
- <3, 9, 1, 13>
- <3, 9, 1, 19>
- <3, 9, 11, 1>
- <3, 13, 4, 12>
- <8, 10, 4, 13>
- <15, 2, 5, 16>
