Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {9, 11, 14}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 11, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 4, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 3, 7, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {4, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 4, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. These are nodes 3, 4, and 14. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the final answer is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are <3, (7, 9, 10)>, <4, (6, 12, 13)>, and <14, (2, 3, 13)>.
