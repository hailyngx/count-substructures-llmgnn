Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 27) (22, 4) (22, 11) (27, 13) (27, 12) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 21) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 20) (7, 23) (2, 8) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 1) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 0) (28, 4) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 19) (3, 6) (3, 21) (3, 9) (21, 12) (21, 3) (9, 18) (9, 3) (9, 29) (9, 24) (29, 9) (29, 16) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 29) (16, 14) (23, 7) (23, 2) (23, 26) (23, 17) (26, 23) (26, 17) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 23) (17, 26) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 22) (11, 7) (11, 20) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 1) (20, 12) (20, 7) (20, 11) (24, 9) (25, 5) (25, 14) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 5) (14, 2) (14, 16) (14, 25) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (8, 14, 16)>
<3, (6, 9, 21)>
<4, (18, 19, 21)>
<7, (12, 16, 20)>
<8, (19, 8, 13)>
<9, (3, 9, 18)>
<10, (0, 10, 13)>
<11, (7, 11, 20)>
<13, (0, 10, 13)>
<16, (7, 14, 16)>
<17, (17, 19, 23)>
<18, (4, 18, 19)>
<19, (8, 13, 19)>
<20, (7, 11, 20)>
<21, (12, 19, 21)>
<23, (17, 19, 23)>
