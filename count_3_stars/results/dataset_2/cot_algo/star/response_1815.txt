Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 11, 12}

Now let's identify the nodes that could form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 70. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 1, 12>
- <0, 1, 13>
- <0, 1, 5>
- <0, 5, 6>
- <0, 5, 12>
- <0, 5, 13>
- <1, 11, 12>
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 11>
- <1, 11, 14>
- <3, 10, 14>
- <4, 11, 12>
- <4, 11, 14>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 13, 0>
- <5, 9, 14>
- <6, 10, 12>
- <6, 10, 13>
- <6, 10, 2>
- <6, 12, 11>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <8, 6, 10>
- <10, 12, 14>
