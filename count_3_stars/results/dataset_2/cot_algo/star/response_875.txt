Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (3, 11) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 11) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 19) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (19, 4) (19, 1) 

Response:
Since we know this is a 3-star graph problem, we will first find the neighbors of each node. Then we will count the number of unique 3-stars. 

The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 14, 15
- Node 1: 6, 7, 17, 19
- Node 2: 4, 6, 12, 14
- Node 3: 11
- Node 4: 2, 6, 12, 18, 19
- Node 5: 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1
- Node 8: 10, 13
- Node 9: 5, 10, 16
- Node 10: 8, 9
- Node 11: 3, 14, 15, 18
- Node 12: 2, 4, 14
- Node 13: 8, 15, 17
- Node 14: 0, 2, 11, 12, 13, 17
- Node 15: 0, 11, 13
- Node 16: 9, 18
- Node 17: 1, 13, 14
- Node 18: 4, 11, 16
- Node 19: 1, 4

Now we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. 
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up all the 3-stars, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 51 \) 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [51], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (17, 19, 4)>
- <2, (4, 12, 14)>
- <4, (12, 14, 2)>
- <6, (1, 2, 4)>
- <9, (10, 5, 16)>
- <11, (18, 14, 15)>
- <14, (0, 13, 17)>
- <15, (0, 11, 13)>
- <17, (1, 13, 14)>
- <18, (4, 11, 16)>
