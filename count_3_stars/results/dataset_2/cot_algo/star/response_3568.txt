Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 12) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: {3, 5, 12, 14}
Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 7, 14}
Node 2: {3, 5, 12, 13, 14}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7, 10}
Node 4: {1, 5, 6, 12, 13}
Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10}
Node 6: {4, 5, 14}
Node 7: {1, 3, 8, 9, 10}
Node 8: {7, 11}
Node 9: {7, 11}
Node 10: {3, 5, 7, 11, 14}
Node 11: {8, 9, 10}
Node 12: {0, 2, 4}
Node 13: {2, 4}
Node 14: {0, 1, 2, 6, 10}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars formed:  
Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 3: 1 3-star
Node 5: 1 3-star
Node 10: 1 3-star
Node 14: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 4, 5>
<3, 0, 7>
<5, 0, 10>
<10, 7, 14>
<14, 2, 5>
