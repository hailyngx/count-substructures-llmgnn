Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 20) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 20) (13, 22) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 15) (22, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 27) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 27) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 1) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 28) (23, 11) (23, 5) (25, 11) (25, 21) (25, 15) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 29) (28, 8) (18, 9) (18, 0) (3, 26) (3, 0) (3, 27) (24, 2) (24, 29) (19, 4) (20, 16) (20, 9) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 10) (12, 22) (12, 20) (12, 15) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 12) (4, 16) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 10) (29, 26) (29, 14) (29, 24) (10, 20) (10, 4) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 27) (27, 6) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we need to first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {3, 7, 18}
- Node 1: {5, 16, 17}
- Node 2: {7, 13, 24}
- Node 3: {0, 26, 27}
- Node 4: {10, 16, 19, 21}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 9, 11, 23}
- Node 6: {5, 14, 27}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8, 20}
- Node 8: {7, 28}
- Node 9: {5, 18, 20}
- Node 10: {4, 20}
- Node 11: {5, 14, 16, 23, 25}
- Node 12: {15, 20, 22}
- Node 13: {2, 22}
- Node 14: {6, 11, 22, 29}
- Node 15: {12, 22, 25}
- Node 16: {1, 4, 11, 20}
- Node 17: {1}
- Node 18: {0, 9}
- Node 19: {4}
- Node 20: {4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 16}
- Node 21: {4, 25, 26}
- Node 22: {12, 13, 14, 15}
- Node 23: {5, 11}
- Node 24: {2, 29}
- Node 25: {11, 15, 21}
- Node 26: {3, 21, 27, 29}
- Node 27: {2, 3, 6, 26}
- Node 28: {8}
- Node 29: {14, 24, 26}

Nodes 0, 3, 17, 28, and 19 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form a 3-star.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least three neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
  <1, 5, 16>, <1, 5, 17>, <1, 16, 17>

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
  <2, 7, 13>, <2, 7, 24>, <2, 13, 24>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <4, 10, 16>, <4, 10, 19>, <4, 10, 21>, <4, 16, 21>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <5, 9, 11>, <5, 11, 16>, <5, 11, 23>, <5, 16, 23>, <5, 9, 23>,
  <5, 1, 16>, <5, 1, 17>, <5, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 6>, <5, 6, 11>

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
  <6, 14, 27>, <6, 14, 29>, <6, 27, 29>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
  <7, 20, 0>, <7, 20, 2>, <7, 20, 9>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
  <9, 18, 20>, <9, 18, 0>, <9, 18, 5>

- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <11, 14, 23>, <11, 16, 25>, <11, 23, 25>, <11, 14, 5>, <11, 5, 16>,
  <11, 5, 23>, <11, 5, 9>, <11, 5, 6>, <11, 6, 14>, <11, 6, 27>

- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
  <12, 15, 20>, <12, 15, 22>, <12, 20, 22>

- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <14, 22, 29>, <14, 22, 6>, <14, 6, 27>, <14, 27, 29>

- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
  <15, 22, 25>, <15, 25, 21>, <15, 21, 26>

- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <16, 20, 4>, <16, 20, 1>, <16, 4, 21>, <16, 4, 10>

- Node 20: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  <20, 9, 18>, <20, 9, 7>, <20, 9, 5>, <20, 7, 0>, <20, 7, 2>,
  <20, 7, 10>, <20, 0, 3>, <20, 3, 26>, <20, 3, 27>, <20, 3, 0>,
  <20, 10, 4>, <20, 10, 21>, <20, 10, 19>, <20, 10, 16>, <20, 4, 19>,
  <20, 12, 15>, <20, 12, 22>, <20, 12, 16>, <20, 12, 25>, <20, 12, 22>

- Node 21: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
  <21, 25, 26>, <21, 26, 29>, <21, 26, 27>

- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <22, 12, 15>, <22, 12, 20>, <22, 12, 25>, <22, 15, 25>

- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <26, 21, 25>, <26, 21, 27>, <26, 21, 4>, <26, 21, 29>

- Node 27: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <27, 2, 3>, <27, 2, 7>, <27, 2, 24>, <27, 3, 26>

- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
  <29, 24, 2>, <29, 24, 26>, <29, 2, 14>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 3 + 3 + 10 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 94].
