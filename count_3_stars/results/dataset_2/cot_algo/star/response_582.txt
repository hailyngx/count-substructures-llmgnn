Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 7) (15, 17) (15, 11) (12, 5) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 5) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 16) (11, 1) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 11) (0, 17) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 9) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11) 

Response:
Since we have 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can begin by constructing the adjacency list representation of the graph. Then we can calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph following the provided method.

The adjacency list representation of the given graph is as follows:

- Node 0: [11, 17]
- Node 1: [11, 9, 7]
- Node 2: [18, 5]
- Node 3: [19, 14, 13]
- Node 4: [8, 14, 13]
- Node 5: [2, 12, 16]
- Node 6: [8, 18, 11]
- Node 7: [1, 16, 10, 9, 13]
- Node 8: [4, 16, 6]
- Node 9: [1, 7, 13]
- Node 10: [7, 14]
- Node 11: [1, 15, 0, 6, 17]
- Node 12: [5]
- Node 13: [4, 7, 3, 9]
- Node 14: [4, 19, 3, 10]
- Node 15: [17, 11]
- Node 16: [8, 7, 5]
- Node 17: [15, 11, 0]
- Node 18: [2, 19, 6]
- Node 19: [18, 14, 3]

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, therefore we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 1 as the center.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so only 1 3-star can be formed with Node 4 as the center.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, therefore we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 7 as the center.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, therefore we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with Node 11 as the center.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, therefore we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 13 as the center.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, therefore we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with Node 14 as the center.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the given graph is \([39]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 7, 13>
- <1, 7, 16>
- <1, 7, 10>
- <1, 7, 11>
- <4, 8, 16>
- <7, 13, 9>
- <7, 13, 4>
- <7, 13, 3>
- <7, 9, 1>
- <7, 9, 13>
- <7, 16, 8>
- <7, 16, 5>
- <7, 16, 6>
- <7, 16, 11>
- <7, 16, 18>
- <7, 16, 19>
- <11, 15, 17>
- <13, 4, 14>
- <13, 4, 19>
- <13, 4, 3>
- <13, 9, 7>
- <14, 4, 19>
- <14, 4, 3>
- <14, 7, 10>
- <14, 7, 4>
