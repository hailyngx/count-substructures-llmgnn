Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the number of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8, 5)
Node 1: 5 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
Node 2: 2 neighbors (5, 8)
Node 3: 5 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 8, 9)
Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6)
Node 5: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Node 6: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 9)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 3)
Node 8: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 9)
Node 9: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 8)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 1>
<0, 5, 3>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 5, 8>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 8>
<1, 5, 0>
<1, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 7>
<1, 5, 8>
<3, 1, 5>
