Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (10, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 18) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 19) (12, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 1) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given edges in a more readable format:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 18.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 13, 17.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 14, 15, 19.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 15, 16.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 13, 17, 19.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 9, 18.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 14.
- Node 10 is connected to node 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 17, 18.
- Node 12 is connected to node 16.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, 10.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 11, 19.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 5.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 5, 12.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 11.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 11.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 14.

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the number of 3-stars in this graph. The nodes with three or more neighbors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. Since all of these nodes have exactly three neighbors, there is only one 3-star associated with each of these nodes. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 5, 18)>
<2, (1, 13, 17)>
<3, (5, 14, 19)>
<4, (8, 9, 14)>
<5, (1, 3, 15)>
<6, (13, 17, 19)>
<8, (4, 9, 18)>
<9, (4, 8, 14)>
<11, (14, 17, 18)>
<13, (2, 6, 7)>
<14, (3, 9, 19)>
<17, (2, 6, 11)>
<18, (1, 8, 11)>
<19, (3, 6, 14)>
