Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 6, 8, 3, 14, 7, 0
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 13
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 7, 2, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 6, 2, 10, 14
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 0

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

So, the final answer is [36] and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (6, 8, 3)>
- <2, (6, 8, 14)>
- <2, (6, 3, 14)>
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, 14)>
- <2, (8, 3, 14)>
- <4, (5, 9, 1)>
- <4, (5, 9, 13)>
- <4, (9, 1, 13)>
- <6, (9, 7, 2)>
- <6, (9, 7, 8)>
- <6, (2, 7, 8)>
- <7, (6, 2, 10)>
- <7, (6, 2, 14)>
- <7, (6, 7, 10)>
- <7, (6, 7, 14)>
- <8, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (5, 6, 2)>
- <8, (5, 8, 0)>
- <8, (6, 2, 0)>
- <8, (2, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 7, 8)>
- <8, (2, 7, 0)>
- <8, (3, 0, 8)>
- <8, (7, 0, 8)>
