Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

- Node 0: {6, 8, 5, 7, 3, 12}
- Node 1: {10, 13, 4, 12}
- Node 2: {11, 12, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 14}
- Node 4: {9, 11, 1, 2}
- Node 5: {10, 13, 0, 7, 14}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {9, 11, 5, 0, 14}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 0, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {8, 1, 13, 5}
- Node 11: {7, 8, 12, 4, 2}
- Node 12: {11, 8, 0, 1, 2}
- Node 13: {9, 10, 5, 1}
- Node 14: {5, 7, 3}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors that can form 3-stars are:
- Node 0, Node 5, Node 7, Node 8, Node 12

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54 \). 
So, the final answer is [54].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 8, 12)>, <5, (10, 13, 0)>, <5, (10, 13, 7)>, <7, (9, 11, 5)>, <7, (9, 13, 5)>, <8, (10, 11, 12)>, <12, (11, 8, 0)>.
