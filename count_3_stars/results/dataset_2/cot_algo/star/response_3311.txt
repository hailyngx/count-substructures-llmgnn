Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 17) (19, 9) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (16, 10) (16, 17) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 17) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 17) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

For each node, we need to find its neighbors. Then for each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with it. 

From the provided edges, the neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 5}
- Node 2: {13, 15, 18}
- Node 3: {6, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {15, 17}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 17}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 12}
- Node 7: {6, 8, 11, 15}
- Node 8: {7, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 10: {12, 16}
- Node 11: {7, 8, 12}
- Node 12: {3, 6, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 15: {2, 4, 7, 17, 18}
- Node 16: {10, 17}
- Node 17: {4, 5, 9, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {2, 15}
- Node 19: {9}

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 44

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 5>, <2, 13, 15>, <3, 6, 12>, <5, 7, 17>, <7, 15, 17>, <9, 14, 17>
