Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 28) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 13) (29, 2) (29, 16) (28, 9) (28, 18) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 14) (12, 22) (26, 2) (26, 25) (26, 11) (1, 7) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 24) (16, 29) (16, 10) (8, 9) (8, 18) (10, 16) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 25) (21, 12) (21, 10) (21, 4) (21, 5) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 10) (25, 27) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 5) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 1) (0, 11) (0, 23) (13, 6) (13, 2) (11, 26) (11, 27) (11, 0) (19, 17) (19, 20) (24, 1) (24, 23) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 21) (20, 19) (20, 23) (22, 12) (22, 10) (22, 17) (17, 19) (17, 22) (17, 18) (23, 0) (23, 24) (23, 20) (18, 28) (18, 8) (18, 17) (5, 7) (5, 21) (5, 27) 

Response:
First, we need to find the set of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 23}
- Node 1: {7, 14, 24, 25}
- Node 2: {13, 15, 26, 29}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 14, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 9, 21}
- Node 5: {7, 21, 27}
- Node 6: {9, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 12}
- Node 8: {9, 18, 28}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 6, 8, 28}
- Node 10: {16, 21, 22, 25}
- Node 11: {0, 26, 27}
- Node 12: {6, 7, 14, 21, 22}
- Node 13: {2, 6}
- Node 14: {1, 3, 12}
- Node 15: {2, 3}
- Node 16: {10, 29}
- Node 17: {19, 20, 22}
- Node 18: {8, 17, 28}
- Node 19: {17, 20}
- Node 20: {19, 23}
- Node 21: {10, 12, 4, 5}
- Node 22: {10, 12, 17}
- Node 23: {0, 20, 24}
- Node 24: {1, 23}
- Node 25: {1, 10, 26, 27}
- Node 26: {2, 11, 25}
- Node 27: {5, 11, 25}
- Node 28: {8, 9, 18}
- Node 29: {2, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 3: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 10: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 12: 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 17: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 18: 3 choose 3 = 1
- Node 21: 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 25: 4 choose 3 = 4

Total number of unique 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

Unique 3-stars:
- <2, 13, 15, 26>
- <3, 4, 9, 14>
- <3, 4, 9, 15>
- <3, 9, 14, 15>
- <9, 8, 18, 28>
- <10, 16, 21, 25>
- <12, 7, 21, 25>
- <12, 14, 21, 25>
- <1, 14, 24, 25>
- <12, 14, 22, 25>
- <5, 7, 21, 27>
- <25, 26, 27, 11>
- <5, 25, 27, 11>
- <17, 18, 28, 8>
- <22, 17, 18, 28>
- <0, 11, 23, 24>
- <20, 19, 17, 22>
- <23, 20, 19, 17>
- <23, 24, 1, 14>
- <2, 29, 16, 10>
- <12, 7, 1, 5>
- <12, 22, 10, 17>
- <13, 6, 9, 3>
