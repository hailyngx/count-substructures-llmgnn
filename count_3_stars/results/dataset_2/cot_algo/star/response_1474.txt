Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 26) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 16) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 13) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 8) (21, 5) (4, 8) (4, 25) (8, 21) (8, 4) (8, 25) (28, 0) (28, 25) (29, 9) (29, 11) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 10) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 14) (0, 28) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 21) (5, 0) (5, 24) (5, 15) (13, 7) (13, 21) (13, 17) (17, 12) (17, 13) (17, 20) (17, 24) (20, 17) (20, 19) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 5) (25, 6) (25, 4) (25, 8) (25, 28) (25, 27) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 23) (10, 12) (10, 1) (2, 14) (22, 16) (22, 24) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 3) (19, 7) (19, 20) (16, 9) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 18) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 22) (24, 23) (11, 6) (11, 29) (11, 27) (3, 18) (23, 27) (23, 24) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 28, 14, 5
- Node 1: 7, 15, 10
- Node 2: 14
- Node 3: 18
- Node 4: 8, 25
- Node 5: 21, 0, 24, 15
- Node 6: 25, 11, 26
- Node 7: 21, 12, 19, 1, 13
- Node 8: 21, 4, 25
- Node 9: 29, 18, 16
- Node 10: 12, 1
- Node 11: 6, 29, 27
- Node 12: 7, 10, 17, 15
- Node 13: 7, 21, 17
- Node 14: 26, 0, 2
- Node 15: 12, 1, 5
- Node 16: 9, 27, 22, 18
- Node 17: 12, 13, 20, 24
- Node 18: 9, 16, 3
- Node 19: 7, 20
- Node 20: 17, 19
- Node 21: 7, 8, 26, 5, 13
- Node 22: 16, 24
- Node 23: 27, 24
- Node 24: 5, 17, 22, 23
- Node 25: 6, 4, 8, 28, 27
- Node 26: 21, 6, 14
- Node 27: 25, 11, 16, 23
- Node 28: 0, 25
- Node 29: 9, 11

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars
- Node 1: 0 3-stars
- Node 2: 0 3-stars
- Node 3: 0 3-stars
- Node 4: 0 3-stars
- Node 5: 0 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star: <6, 25, 11>
- Node 7: 1 3-star: <7, 21, 13>
- Node 8: 0 3-stars
- Node 9: 0 3-stars
- Node 10: 0 3-stars
- Node 11: 0 3-stars
- Node 12: 0 3-stars
- Node 13: 0 3-stars
- Node 14: 0 3-stars
- Node 15: 0 3-stars
- Node 16: 0 3-stars
- Node 17: 0 3-stars
- Node 18: 0 3-stars
- Node 19: 0 3-stars
- Node 20: 0 3-stars
- Node 21: 0 3-stars
- Node 22: 0 3-stars
- Node 23: 0 3-stars
- Node 24: 0 3-stars
- Node 25: 0 3-stars
- Node 26: 0 3-stars
- Node 27: 0 3-stars
- Node 28: 0 3-stars
- Node 29: 0 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <6, 25, 11> and <7, 21, 13>.
