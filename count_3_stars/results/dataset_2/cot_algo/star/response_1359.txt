Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (3, 9) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 18) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (16, 17) (16, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (2, 19) (2, 9) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 8, 14, 15
Node 1: 6, 7, 8, 11, 12
Node 2: 9, 19
Node 3: 9
Node 4: 8, 13, 15
Node 5: 12, 16, 18
Node 6: 1, 10, 13
Node 7: 1, 12
Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 17
Node 9: 2, 3, 15
Node 10: 6, 13, 19
Node 11: 1, 18, 19
Node 12: 1, 5, 7, 14
Node 13: 4, 6, 10
Node 14: 0, 12, 15, 19
Node 15: 0, 4, 9, 14
Node 16: 5, 17
Node 17: 8, 16
Node 18: 5, 11
Node 19: 2, 10, 11, 14

Now let's identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors to form 3-stars:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors
Node 4 has 3 neighbors
Node 5 has 3 neighbors
Node 6 has 3 neighbors
Node 8 has 4 neighbors
Node 9 has 3 neighbors
Node 10 has 3 neighbors
Node 11 has 3 neighbors
Node 12 has 4 neighbors
Node 13 has 3 neighbors
Node 14 has 4 neighbors
Node 15 has 4 neighbors
Node 19 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node using \( \binom{n}{3} \) where n is the number of neighbors for each node, we get:

Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 4: 0 3-stars
Node 5: 0 3-stars
Node 6: 0 3-stars
Node 8: 4 3-stars
Node 9: 0 3-stars
Node 10: 0 3-stars
Node 11: 0 3-stars
Node 12: 4 3-stars
Node 13: 0 3-stars
Node 14: 4 3-stars
Node 15: 4 3-stars
Node 19: 4 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 7, 12)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 12)>
<8, (0, 4, 15)>
<12, (1, 5, 14)>
<12, (1, 7, 14)>
<12, (5, 14, 19)>
<14, (0, 12, 15)>
<14, (0, 12, 19)>
<14, (12, 15, 19)>
<15, (0, 12, 14)>
<15, (0, 12, 19)>
<15, (4, 9, 15)>
<15, (9, 14, 15)>
<19, (10, 11, 14)>
<19, (10, 14, 15)>
