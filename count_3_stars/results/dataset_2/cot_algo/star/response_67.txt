Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (7, 13) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 14) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 6, 10}
- Node 2: {8, 10, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 8, 10}
- Node 7: {9, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 9: {7, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 9, 11}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding all the 3-stars from the listed nodes gives a total of 69 unique 3-stars.
Therefore, the final answer is [69].
