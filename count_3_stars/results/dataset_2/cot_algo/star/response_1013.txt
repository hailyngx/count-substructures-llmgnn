Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:
- 0: {1, 4, 5, 9}
- 1: {0, 4, 9}
- 2: {4, 6}
- 3: {4, 5, 7, 8}
- 4: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- 5: {0, 3, 4, 8}
- 6: {2, 7, 9}
- 7: {3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- 8: {3, 5, 7, 9}
- 9: {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 35 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 73 \), so the final answer is [73].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 2)>, 
<7, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<8, (3, 5, 7)>, 
<9, (0, 1, 4)>.
