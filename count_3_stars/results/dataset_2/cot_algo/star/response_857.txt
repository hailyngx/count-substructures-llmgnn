Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 7, 2}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, 1, 2, and 3 can form 3-stars since they have 4 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>
