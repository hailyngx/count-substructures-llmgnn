Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Since there are 10 nodes, let's denote them as nodes 0 to 9. The given edges can be represented in an adjacency list format as follows:

0: [9, 2, 7]
1: [5, 3, 4, 7]
2: [3, 4, 8, 7, 0]
3: [9, 1, 2, 8]
4: [9, 6, 1, 8, 2]
5: [8, 1]
6: [8, 4]
7: [9, 1, 8, 2, 0]
8: [5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7]
9: [4, 3, 7, 0]

Now, we will identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 9, 2, 7 (3 neighbors)
Node 1 neighbors: 5, 3, 4, 7 (4 neighbors)
Node 2 neighbors: 3, 4, 8, 7, 0 (5 neighbors)
Node 3 neighbors: 9, 1, 2, 8 (4 neighbors)
Node 4 neighbors: 9, 6, 1, 8, 2 (5 neighbors)
Node 5 neighbors: 8, 1 (2 neighbors)
Node 6 neighbors: 8, 4 (2 neighbors)
Node 7 neighbors: 9, 1, 8, 2, 0 (5 neighbors)
Node 8 neighbors: 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7 (6 neighbors)
Node 9 neighbors: 4, 3, 7, 0 (4 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0, 1 combination: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 2 combination: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3 combination: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 4 combination: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7 combination: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 8 combination: inom{6}{3} = 20
Node 9 combination: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 59.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7, 0)>
<3, (9, 1, 2, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 1, 8, 2)>
<7, (9, 1, 8, 2, 0)>
<8, (5, 6, 3, 4, 2, 7)>
<9, (4, 3, 7, 0)>
