Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (1, 29) (1, 23) (21, 11) (21, 23) (21, 2) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 26) (8, 6) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 9) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 24) (19, 26) (26, 3) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 4) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 4) (28, 17) (28, 10) (28, 15) (5, 26) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 20) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 27) (20, 13) (20, 7) (20, 27) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 22) (25, 29) (25, 27) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 25) (22, 5) (22, 29) (22, 17) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 28) (17, 22) (24, 18) (24, 4) (24, 15) (15, 26) (15, 28) (15, 24) (9, 11) (9, 23) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 28) (14, 18) (4, 26) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 24) (12, 11) (12, 9) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

Now, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0 neighbors: {16, 7, 9}
- Node 1 neighbors: {29, 23}
- Node 2 neighbors: {21, 18, 10, 7}
- Node 3 neighbors: {10, 13, 26}
- Node 4 neighbors: {26, 6, 5, 24}
- Node 5 neighbors: {26, 13, 22, 4}
- Node 6 neighbors: {8, 17, 4}
- Node 7 neighbors: {2, 0, 20, 27}
- Node 8 neighbors: {6}
- Node 9 neighbors: {11, 23, 0, 12}
- Node 10 neighbors: {3, 2, 28}
- Node 11 neighbors: {16, 9, 21, 12}
- Node 12 neighbors: {11, 9}
- Node 13 neighbors: {3, 5, 20}
- Node 14 neighbors: {18}
- Node 15 neighbors: {26, 28, 24}
- Node 16 neighbors: {11, 0, 17}
- Node 17 neighbors: {16, 6, 28, 22}
- Node 18 neighbors: {2, 14, 24}
- Node 19 neighbors: {26}
- Node 20 neighbors: {13, 7, 27}
- Node 21 neighbors: {11, 23, 2}
- Node 22 neighbors: {5, 29, 17}
- Node 23 neighbors: {1, 21, 9}
- Node 24 neighbors: {18, 4, 15}
- Node 25 neighbors: {29, 27}
- Node 26 neighbors: {3, 19, 5, 15, 4}
- Node 27 neighbors: {7, 20, 25}
- Node 28 neighbors: {17, 10, 15}
- Node 29 neighbors: {1, 25, 22}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (9, 16, 21)>
Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (0, 11, 17)>
Node 26 forms two 3-stars: <26, (3, 4, 15)> and <26, (5, 15, 28)>
Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (10, 21, 7)>
Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (0, 20, 27)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (11, 12, 23)>
Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (16, 22, 28)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 24, 26)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [8].
