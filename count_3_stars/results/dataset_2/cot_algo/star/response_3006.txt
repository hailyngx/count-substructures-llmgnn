Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 24) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 18) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 19) (11, 23) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 11) (23, 14) (10, 16) (10, 14) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 22) (21, 24) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 2) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 19) (12, 21) (12, 13) (20, 21) (20, 29) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 1) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 14) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 27) (26, 8) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 24) (22, 21) (22, 0) (22, 25) (22, 27) (27, 1) (27, 22) (24, 9) (24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 23) (14, 10) (14, 25) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {16, 2, 22}
- Node 1: Neighbors {29, 25, 27}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 0, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 7, 23}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 18, 14, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 6, 23}
- Node 6: Neighbors {15, 5, 18}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 4, 14, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {9, 29, 26}
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 8, 25, 24}
- Node 10: Neighbors {16, 14}
- Node 11: Neighbors {23}
- Node 12: Neighbors {21, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 12, 24}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 7, 23, 10, 25}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 6, 16}
- Node 16: Neighbors {15, 10, 0}
- Node 17: Neighbors {4, 19, 24}
- Node 18: Neighbors {4, 6, 19}
- Node 19: Neighbors {18, 2, 17}
- Node 20: Neighbors {21, 29}
- Node 21: Neighbors {20, 12, 22, 24}
- Node 22: Neighbors {21, 0, 25, 27}
- Node 23: Neighbors {3, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 24: Neighbors {9, 21, 17, 13}
- Node 25: Neighbors {9, 1, 22, 14}
- Node 26: Neighbors {8}
- Node 27: Neighbors {1, 22}
- Node 29: Neighbors {8, 20, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star graphs formed by each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 21 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 22 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 24 forms 1 3-star graph
- Node 25 forms 1 3-star graph

The total number of 3-star graphs is 11, which we represent as [11].

The unique 3-star graphs are:
- <3, (2, 7, 23)>
- <4, (7, 17, 14)>
- <5, (9, 6, 23)>
- <6, (18, 15, 5)>
- <7, (13, 3, 14)>
- <9, (8, 24, 25)>
- <14, (23, 4, 25)>
- <21, (20, 22, 24)>
- <22, (21, 25, 27)>
- <24, (21, 13, 9)>
- <25, (1, 22, 14)>
