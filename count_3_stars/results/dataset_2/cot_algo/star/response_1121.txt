Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 6) (14, 13) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 17) (15, 7) (15, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 17) (4, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {9, 17, 12, 13}
Node 1: {6, 2, 7}
Node 2: {8, 1, 19, 10}
Node 3: {8, 11, 12}
Node 4: {11}
Node 5: {9, 18}
Node 6: {1, 14}
Node 7: {1, 15, 19, 18}
Node 8: {2, 16, 3}
Node 9: {5, 0, 19}
Node 10: {2}
Node 11: {3, 18, 12, 4}
Node 12: {3, 11, 0, 17}
Node 13: {0, 14, 18}
Node 14: {6, 13}
Node 15: {7, 16}
Node 16: {8, 17, 15}
Node 17: {0, 16, 12, 19}
Node 18: {5, 11, 7, 13}
Node 19: {9, 2, 7, 17}

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 1 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 2 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 3 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 7 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 9 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 11 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 12 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 13 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 14 has 2 neighbors -> no 3-star
Node 15 has 2 neighbors -> no 3-star
Node 16 has 3 neighbors -> 1 3-star
Node 17 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 18 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 19 has 4 neighbors -> inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found: <0, (9, 17, 12)>, <1, (6, 2, 7)>, <2, (8, 1, 19)>, <3, (8, 11, 12)>, <7, (1, 15, 16)>, <8, (2, 16, 3)>, <9, (5, 0, 19)>, <11, (18, 3, 12)>, <12, (3, 11, 17)>, <13, (18, 0, 14)>, <16, (8, 17, 15)>, <17, (0, 16, 12)>, <18, (5, 11, 7)>, <19, (9, 2, 7)>.
