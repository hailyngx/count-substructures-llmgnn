Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 12) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 7, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 11: {12, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {2, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 11}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: No 3-star (has only 4 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: No 3-star (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: No 3-star (has only 4 neighbors)
- Node 10: No 3-star (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: No 3-star (has only 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [58].
