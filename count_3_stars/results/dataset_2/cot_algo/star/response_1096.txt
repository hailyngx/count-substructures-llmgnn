Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 11) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first determine the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0 neighbors: {3, 9, 11}
- Node 1 neighbors: {5, 7, 11}
- Node 2 neighbors: {5, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4 neighbors: {3, 10, 13}
- Node 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 13}
- Node 6 neighbors: {3, 8, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 7 neighbors: {1, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 8 neighbors: {2, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 9 neighbors: {0, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 10 neighbors: {4, 7, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 11 neighbors: {0, 1, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 12 neighbors: {6, 10}
- Node 13 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 7, 11}
- Node 14 neighbors: {2, 6, 11}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

From the combinatorial calculation, we see that nodes 0, 9, 11 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we can form inom{n}{3} 3-stars with each of these nodes.

- inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star with node 0: <0, 9, 11>
- inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars with node 9: <9, 0, 11>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 0, 7>, <9, 0, 8>, <9, 0, 10>, <9, 11, 6>, <9, 11, 7>, <9, 11, 8>, <9, 11, 10>, <9, 6, 7>, <9, 6, 8>, <9, 6, 10>, <9, 7, 8>, <9, 7, 10>, <9, 8, 10>, <9, 6, 12>, <9, 8, 12>, <9, 10, 12>, <9, 7, 12>, <9, 0, 12>
- inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars with node 11: <11, 9, 0>, <11, 9, 6>, <11, 9, 7>, <11, 9, 8>, <11, 9, 10>, <11, 0, 6>, <11, 0, 7>, <11, 0, 8>, <11, 0, 10>, <11, 6, 7>, <11, 6, 8>, <11, 6, 10>, <11, 7, 8>, <11, 7, 10>, <11, 8, 10>, <11, 6, 14>, <11, 8, 14>, <11, 10, 14>, <11, 7, 14>, <11, 0, 14>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 20 + 20 = 41, so the final answer is [41].
