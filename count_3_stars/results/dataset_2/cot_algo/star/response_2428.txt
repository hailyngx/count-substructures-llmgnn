Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 13) (3, 8) (26, 1) (26, 6) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 10) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 5) (22, 12) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 6) (19, 22) (19, 5) (19, 23) (29, 21) (29, 10) (25, 1) (25, 16) (25, 0) (27, 21) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 17) (16, 25) (16, 7) (16, 4) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 11) (0, 25) (0, 28) (0, 24) (28, 9) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 4) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 8) (24, 14) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 12) (4, 16) (4, 28) (4, 17) (21, 29) (21, 27) (21, 17) (12, 22) (12, 5) (12, 28) (12, 8) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 24) (14, 18) (14, 15) (18, 13) (18, 14) (10, 9) (10, 29) (15, 14) (2, 11) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 20) (6, 26) (6, 13) (11, 20) (11, 2) (11, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 21) (17, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 1: 3, 20, 25, 14
- Node 3: 1, 24, 13, 8
- Node 26: 1, 6
- Node 9: 22, 28, 10
- Node 22: 9, 19, 5, 12
- Node 5: 22, 19, 12, 14
- Node 13: 3, 18, 6
- Node 19: 22, 5, 23
- Node 29: 21, 10
- Node 25: 1, 16, 0
- Node 27: 21
- Node 7: 16, 23, 17
- Node 16: 25, 7, 4
- Node 20: 1, 23, 11
- Node 0: 25, 28, 24
- Node 28: 9, 0, 12, 4
- Node 24: 3, 0, 8, 14
- Node 8: 3, 24, 12
- Node 4: 16, 28, 17
- Node 21: 29, 27, 17
- Node 12: 22, 5, 28, 8
- Node 14: 1, 5, 24, 18, 15
- Node 18: 13, 14
- Node 10: 9, 29
- Node 15: 14
- Node 2: 11
- Node 23: 19, 7, 20
- Node 6: 26, 13
- Node 11: 20, 2, 17
- Node 17: 7, 4, 21, 11

Next, we will identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 1: [C(4,3)] = [4]
  <1, (3, 20, 25)>, <1, (3, 20, 14)>, <1, (3, 25, 14)>, <1, (20, 25, 14)>
- Node 3: [C(4,3)] = [4]
  <3, (1, 24, 13)>, <3, (1, 24, 8)>, <3, (1, 13, 8)>, <3, (24, 13, 8)>
- Node 22: [C(4,3)] = [4]
  <22, (9, 19, 5)>, <22, (9, 19, 12)>, <22, (9, 5, 12)>, <22, (19, 5, 12)>
- Node 5: [C(4,3)] = [4]
  <5, (22, 19, 12)>, <5, (22, 19, 14)>, <5, (22, 12, 14)>, <5, (19, 12, 14)>
- Node 0: [C(3,3)] = [1]
  <0, (25, 28, 24)>
- Node 24: [C(4,3)] = [4]
  <24, (3, 0, 8)>, <24, (3, 0, 14)>, <24, (3, 8, 14)>, <24, (0, 8, 14)>
- Node 4: [C(4,3)] = [4]
  <4, (16, 28, 17)>, <4, (16, 28, 11)>, <4, (16, 17, 11)>, <4, (28, 17, 11)>
- Node 17: [C(4,3)] = [4]
  <17, (7, 21, 11)>, <17, (7, 21, 17)>, <17, (7, 11, 17)>, <17, (21, 11, 17)>

Total number of 3-stars: [25]
