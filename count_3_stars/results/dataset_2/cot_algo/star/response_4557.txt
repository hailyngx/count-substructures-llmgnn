Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 17) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 14) (18, 15) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 19) (17, 11) (17, 9) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 19) (0, 1) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7, 19}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 13}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 19}
- Node 5: {10, 14}
- Node 6: {9, 15}
- Node 7: {2, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {11, 13, 14, 15, 16}
- Node 9: {6, 14, 17}
- Node 10: {5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {8, 12, 17}
- Node 12: {10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 9, 15}
- Node 15: {6, 8, 14, 18}
- Node 16: {8, 18, 19}
- Node 17: {9, 11}
- Node 18: {15, 16}
- Node 19: {2, 4, 16}

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, Node 10, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, and Node 19 have 3 or more neighbors.

Then, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 51 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [51].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, 2, 3>
- <1, 2, 13>
- <1, 3, 13>
- <1, 7, 13>
- <2, 4, 19>
- <8, 13, 14>
- <8, 13, 15>
- <8, 13, 16>
- <8, 14, 15>
- <8, 14, 9>
- <10, 12, 13>
- <13, 10, 7>
- <13, 10, 12>
- <13, 12, 11>
- <15, 6, 18>
- <16, 8, 19>
- <16, 18, 15>
