Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 24) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 11) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 20) (15, 22) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 29) (12, 4) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 18) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 25) (20, 14) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 18) (26, 23) (26, 21) (26, 11) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 11) (28, 6) (28, 0) (6, 14) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 11) (1, 17) (1, 25) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 6) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 29) (16, 12) (16, 22) (18, 12) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 19) (22, 15) (22, 16) (22, 25) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 13) (0, 21) (0, 28) (24, 9) (24, 27) (24, 8) (25, 8) (25, 1) (25, 22) (13, 3) (13, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {21, 28}
- Node 1: {17, 25, 10}
- Node 2: {3, 8, 20, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 13, 2}
- Node 4: {7, 12}
- Node 5: {3, 10}
- Node 6: {14, 28, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 29}
- Node 8: {2, 24, 25}
- Node 9: {24, 7}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 1}
- Node 11: {17, 26, 6, 21, 23}
- Node 12: {4, 27, 16, 18}
- Node 13: {3, 29}
- Node 14: {17, 6, 20}
- Node 15: {20, 22}
- Node 16: {12, 22}
- Node 17: {14, 1, 11}
- Node 18: {14, 27, 20, 19}
- Node 19: {2, 18, 20}
- Node 20: {14, 15, 18, 2, 19}
- Node 21: {26, 0, 11}
- Node 22: {15, 16, 25}
- Node 23: {26, 11, 29}
- Node 24: {9, 27, 8}
- Node 25: {8, 1, 22}
- Node 26: {23, 21, 11}
- Node 27: {12, 24, 18}
- Node 28: {6, 0}
- Node 29: {7, 13, 23}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 20: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 26: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 27: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (17, 25, 10)>, <2, (3, 8, 20)>, <2, (3, 19, 20)>, <2, (8, 19, 20)>, <3, (2, 8, 20)>, <6, (11, 14, 28)>, <6, (10, 11, 14)>, <6, (11, 21, 26)>, <6, (11, 21, 23)>, <11, (6, 17, 26)>, <12, (4, 16, 27)>, <20, (14, 18, 27)>, <20, (18, 19, 27)>, <20, (18, 19, 20)>, <20, (2, 18, 19)>.
