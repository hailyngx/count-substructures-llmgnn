Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (13, 0) (13, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 9) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we will first find the neighbor nodes for each node. Then, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph.

### Neighbor Nodes:
- Node 0: 10, 11, 13, 14, 4, 8
- Node 1: 5, 7, 9, 12
- Node 2: 12, 14, 6
- Node 3: 10, 12, 14, 9
- Node 4: 0, 12, 13
- Node 5: 1, 10, 14, 7
- Node 6: 2, 14, 8
- Node 7: 1, 5, 9, 11, 8
- Node 8: 0, 6, 7, 11
- Node 9: 1, 3, 7, 12, 14
- Node 10: 0, 3, 5
- Node 11: 0, 7, 8
- Node 12: 2, 3, 4, 1, 9
- Node 13: 0, 4
- Node 14: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9

### 3-Stars:
- <0, 8, 11, 7>
- <0, 10, 3, 14>
- <0, 13, 4, 14>
- <1, 7, 9, 12>
- <1, 9, 3, 14>
- <2, 6, 14, 8>
- <2, 12, 4, 9>
- <4, 12, 13, 0>
- <5, 7, 9, 1>
- <5, 10, 3, 14>
- <6, 2, 14, 8>
- <7, 5, 1, 9>
- <9, 1, 7, 12>
- <9, 3, 14, 5>
- <12, 1, 9, 7>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get $\text{[14]}$.
