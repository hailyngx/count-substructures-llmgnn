Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighborhood set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 2, 7}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find possible 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 2, Node 6, and Node 8 have 4 or more neighbors.

For these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by them:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 6)>
