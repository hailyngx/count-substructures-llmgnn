Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (10, 5) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 0) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 6) (9, 13) (9, 12) (18, 8) (18, 17) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (19, 4) (19, 14) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 11) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 19) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 1, 6, 8, 11, 13
- Node 1: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2: 11, 16
- Node 3: 7, 14, 16, 17
- Node 4: 12, 15, 19
- Node 5: 7, 10, 14
- Node 6: 0, 1, 16
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 13
- Node 8: 0, 17, 18
- Node 9: 12, 13
- Node 10: 5
- Node 11: 0, 2, 12, 17
- Node 12: 4, 9, 11
- Node 13: 0, 7, 9
- Node 14: 3, 5, 19, 15
- Node 15: 4, 14
- Node 16: 2, 3, 6
- Node 17: 3, 8, 11, 18
- Node 18: 8, 17
- Node 19: 4, 14

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 17 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 0, 1, 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19 have 5 neighbors.

For nodes with 4 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars as \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For nodes with 5 neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars as \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 6 \times 4 + 7 \times 10 = 64 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [64].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 6, 1, 7>
- <0, 6, 1, 13>
- <0, 6, 1, 11>
- <0, 6, 1, 0>
- <0, 6, 7, 1>
- <0, 6, 7, 13>
- <0, 6, 7, 11>
- <0, 6, 7, 0>
- <1, 0, 6, 7>
- <1, 0, 6, 13>
- <1, 0, 6, 11>
- <1, 0, 6, 0>
- <1, 0, 6, 16>
- <1, 0, 7, 13>
- <1, 0, 7, 11>
- <1, 0, 7, 0>
- <1, 0, 7, 6>
- <1, 6, 0, 7>
- <1, 6, 0, 13>
- <1, 6, 0, 11>
- <1, 6, 0, 16>
