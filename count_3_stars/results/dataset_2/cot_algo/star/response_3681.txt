Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {6, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {9, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 10}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 10, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 11: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 12: {0, 3, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 2, 5, 14}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 12, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56

Therefore, the final answer is [56], and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 13, 14)>, <1, (7, 10, 13)>, <1, (7, 13, 14)>, 
<1, (10, 13, 14)>, <1, (13, 14, 4)>, <3, (9, 10, 11)>,
<4, (5, 8, 10)>, <4, (5, 8, 11)>, <4, (5, 10, 11)>,
<4, (8, 10, 11)>, <8, (5, 6, 14)>, <10, (3, 4, 9)>,
<10, (7, 9, 11)>, <13, (0, 1, 7)>, <13, (1, 5, 14)>,
<13, (1, 6, 14)>, <13, (1, 7, 14)>, <13, (1, 10, 14)>,
<14, (1, 6, 13)>, <14, (1, 13, 7)>
