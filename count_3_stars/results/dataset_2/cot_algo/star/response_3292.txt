Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 9, 11
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7, 10, 13
- Node 2: 8, 10, 11
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 10, 14
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7, 8, 12
- Node 6: 1, 8, 12, 13
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 8, 10
- Node 8: 2, 5, 6, 7, 11
- Node 9: 0, 3, 11, 13
- Node 10: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 11: 0, 2, 8, 9, 14
- Node 12: 5, 6
- Node 13: 1, 6, 9
- Node 14: 4, 11

Next, let's find the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 5 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 5 neighbors
- Node 11: 5 neighbors

For nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 68 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [68], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 4, 11>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 5, 7>
- <1, 7, 10>
- <3, 5, 7>
- <6, 8, 12>
- <7, 8, 10>
- <8, 11, 14>
- <11, 9, 14>
