Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 7) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 4) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 27) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 5) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 14) (7, 26) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (8, 26) (8, 2) (8, 15) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 18) (5, 20) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 17) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 10) (18, 7) (18, 28) (18, 19) (18, 11) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 21) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 19) (29, 22) (29, 27) (29, 15) (21, 22) (21, 0) (21, 11) (15, 8) (15, 29) (13, 12) (13, 16) (14, 1) (14, 28) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 13) (10, 2) (10, 27) (4, 25) (4, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the provided edges:
- Node 0: {20, 21, 1}
- Node 1: {26, 0, 14}
- Node 2: {8, 19, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {9, 25, 28, 17, 20}
- Node 4: {25, 11}
- Node 5: {20}
- Node 6: {12, 2}
- Node 7: {26, 12, 18}
- Node 8: {26, 2, 15}
- Node 9: {26, 22, 20, 3, 16}
- Node 10: {2, 27}
- Node 11: {18, 4, 21}
- Node 12: {7, 13, 6}
- Node 13: {12, 16}
- Node 14: {1, 28}
- Node 15: {8, 29}
- Node 16: {9, 25, 13}
- Node 17: {3, 23, 19}
- Node 18: {7, 28, 19, 11}
- Node 19: {2, 18, 17}
- Node 20: {9, 3, 0, 5}
- Node 21: {22, 0, 11}
- Node 22: {9, 23, 29, 21}
- Node 23: {22, 17, 27}
- Node 25: {3, 27, 16, 4}
- Node 26: {9, 1, 8, 7}
- Node 27: {25, 23, 29, 10}
- Node 28: {3, 14, 18}
- Node 29: {22, 27, 15}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
  
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 50 

Therefore, the final answer is [50].
