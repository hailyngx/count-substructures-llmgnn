Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (15, 18) (15, 1) (9, 11) (9, 17) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (2, 11) (2, 17) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 10, 14, 19
- Node 1: 6, 15, 16
- Node 2: 11, 17
- Node 3: 0, 8, 12, 13
- Node 4: 13, 17, 18
- Node 5: 6, 7, 14
- Node 6: 1, 5, 10
- Node 7: 5, 10
- Node 8: 3, 11, 16
- Node 9: 11, 17
- Node 10: 0, 6, 7, 12, 14
- Node 11: 2, 8, 9
- Node 12: 3, 10, 17
- Node 13: 3, 4, 16, 17
- Node 14: 0, 5, 10
- Node 15: 1, 18
- Node 16: 1, 8, 13
- Node 17: 2, 4, 9, 12, 13
- Node 18: 4, 15

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each such node:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 5: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 16: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 17: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 3, 10>, <0, 3, 14>, <0, 3, 19>, <0, 10, 14>, <3, 10, 12>
<4, 13, 17>
<5, 6, 10>
<10, 12, 17>
<13, 16, 17>
<14, 5, 10>
<17, 12, 10>
<17, 13, 9>
<17, 13, 4>
<17, 13, 3>
