Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 7, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 8, 5, 7, 2}
- Node 2: {9, 5, 7, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 0, 7}
- Node 4: {5, 1}
- Node 5: {6, 4, 2, 1, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 6: {9, 5, 0}
- Node 7: {8, 5, 0, 3, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {6, 2, 1}

Now, we will determine the 3-stars in this graph. 

Node 5 has 7 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 55, which we will represent as [55]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (6, 2, 0)>, <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 3)>, <5, (6, 2, 5)>, 
<5, (6, 0, 1)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 3)>, <5, (6, 0, 5)>, 
<5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 5)>, 
<5, (6, 7, 3)>, <5, (6, 7, 5)>, 
<5, (2, 0, 1)>, <5, (2, 0, 7)>, <5, (2, 0, 3)>, <5, (2, 0, 5)>, 
<5, (2, 1, 7)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 5)>, 
<5, (2, 7, 3)>, <5, (2, 7, 1)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 3)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<5, (0, 7, 3)>, <5, (0, 7, 5)>, 
<5, (1, 7, 3)>, <5, (1, 7, 5)>, 
<5, (7, 3, 5)>, 
<1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 5)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (9, 8, 5)>, <1, (9, 8, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>.
