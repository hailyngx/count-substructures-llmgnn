Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in an adjacency list format to better understand the connections:

0: 4, 8, 6, 2
1: 7, 2, 8
2: 1, 3, 0
3: 5, 9, 6, 2
4: 9, 7, 8, 0, 6
5: 6, 3
6: 5, 4, 7, 3, 8, 0
7: 9, 4, 6, 1
8: 9, 4, 1, 0, 6
9: 8, 4, 3, 7

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8, 6, 2
- Node 1: 7, 2, 8
- Node 2: 1, 3, 0
- Node 3: 5, 9, 6, 2
- Node 4: 9, 7, 8, 0, 6
- Node 5: 6, 3
- Node 6: 5, 4, 7, 3, 8, 0
- Node 7: 9, 4, 6, 1
- Node 8: 9, 4, 1, 0, 6
- Node 9: 8, 4, 3, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 6 choose 3 = 20 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, the final answer is [48], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (7, 4, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
