Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {10, 14, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 10, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 1, 12, 14, 13}
- Node 3: Neighbors {9, 11, 13, 8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 7, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 11, 8, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 12, 6}
- Node 8: Neighbors {5, 4, 1, 3, 11, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 2, 11, 3}
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 0}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9, 3, 14, 6, 8}
- Node 12: Neighbors {4, 7, 2, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 3, 0, 2}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 11, 12, 0, 6, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} \) = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [85].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 10, 13>
<1, 2, 10>
<1, 2, 14>
<1, 8, 3>
<2, 9, 12>
<3, 9, 13>
<4, 7, 12>
<4, 8, 3>
<6, 11, 14>
<8, 11, 6>
<11, 3, 14>
