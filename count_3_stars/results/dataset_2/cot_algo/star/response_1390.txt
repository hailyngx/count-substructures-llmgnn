Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first construct the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {9, 3, 8, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 11, 14, 4, 8}
- Node 2: {9, 4, 11, 12, 7}
- Node 3: {1, 0, 13}
- Node 4: {5, 1, 8, 6, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 4, 14}
- Node 6: {4, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {9, 8, 13, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 4, 14, 0, 7}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 7, 0, 12}
- Node 10: {13, 6}
- Node 11: {1, 2}
- Node 12: {9, 0, 2}
- Node 13: {3, 8, 10, 14, 7}
- Node 14: {5, 1, 8, 13, 6}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars formed using the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula:

- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 20 + 10 = 30 \). So, we put this number inside brackets: [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <8, (1, 4, 13)>
- <13, (3, 8, 14)>
