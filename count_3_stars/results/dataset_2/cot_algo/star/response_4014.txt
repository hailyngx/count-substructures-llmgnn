Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 26) (10, 4) (10, 21) (17, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 20) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 21) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 18) (11, 22) (11, 0) (11, 18) (20, 4) (20, 5) (20, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 2) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (23, 20) (23, 9) (23, 12) (26, 7) (26, 8) (26, 27) (8, 26) (8, 28) (28, 7) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 15) (12, 23) (12, 9) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 0) (15, 22) (15, 28) (15, 19) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 27) (14, 22) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 25) (2, 13) (2, 25) (2, 19) (24, 29) (24, 18) (9, 23) (9, 12) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 24) (18, 27) (18, 0) (27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 18) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 11, 17, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 29}
- Node 2: {13, 19, 25}
- Node 3: {6, 14, 18}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 20}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 14, 20}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 26, 28}
- Node 8: {26, 28}
- Node 9: {12, 23}
- Node 10: {4, 21}
- Node 11: {0, 18, 22}
- Node 12: {9, 23}
- Node 13: {2, 21, 27}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 22, 25}
- Node 15: {22, 28, 19}
- Node 17: {0}
- Node 18: {0, 3, 11, 24, 27}
- Node 19: {15, 27, 2}
- Node 20: {4, 5, 23}
- Node 21: {10, 13, 29}
- Node 22: {11, 14, 15}
- Node 23: {20, 9, 12}
- Node 24: {18, 29}
- Node 25: {2, 14, 29}
- Node 26: {7, 8, 27}
- Node 27: {13, 18, 19, 26, 28}
- Node 28: {7, 8, 15, 27}
- Node 29: {1, 21, 24, 25}

Next, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:
- Node 0: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 1: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 5: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 6: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \({2 \choose 3}\) not possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: \({2 \choose 3}\) not possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 11: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 12: \({2 \choose 3}\) not possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 14: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 15: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 18: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 19: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 20: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 21: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 22: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 23: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 24: \({2 \choose 3}\) not possible (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 25: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 26: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- Node 27: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- Node 28: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- Node 29: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

Total number of 3-stars: 51, which can be represented as [51].
