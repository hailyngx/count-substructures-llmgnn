Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 12) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 18) (18, 2) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 7) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, we will construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 4, 17
Node 1 neighbors: 3, 12, 14, 15
Node 2 neighbors: 14, 17, 18
Node 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 15
Node 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 10, 13
Node 6 neighbors: 5, 10, 11
Node 7 neighbors: 3, 19
Node 8 neighbors: 10, 19
Node 9 neighbors: 3, 10, 12
Node 10 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 9, 13
Node 11 neighbors: 6, 12, 17
Node 12 neighbors: 1, 9, 11, 15
Node 13 neighbors: 5, 10, 14, 19
Node 14 neighbors: 1, 2, 13, 17
Node 15 neighbors: 1, 4, 12
Node 17 neighbors: 0, 2, 11, 14
Node 18 neighbors: 2
Node 19 neighbors: 7, 8, 13

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 10, 13, 14

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (3, 12, 15)>
<1, (3, 14, 17)>
<1, (12, 14, 15)>
<1, (14, 15, 17)>
<10, (5, 6, 13)>
<10, (5, 9, 13)>
<10, (5, 13, 19)>
<10, (6, 9, 13)>
<10, (6, 13, 19)>
<10, (9, 13, 19)>
<13, (5, 14, 19)>
<13, (10, 14, 19)>
<13, (10, 5, 14)>
<13, (10, 5, 19)>
<14, (1, 17, 2)>
<14, (1, 17, 11)>
<14, (2, 17, 11)>
<14, (17, 2, 11)>
