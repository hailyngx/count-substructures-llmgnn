Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 6}
- Node 6: {4, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars are as follows:
- <0, 1, 2>
- <0, 1, 3>
- <0, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 9>
- <0, 2, 3>
- <0, 2, 7>
- <0, 2, 9>
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 7, 4>
- <0, 7, 8>
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 9, 4>
- <0, 9, 7>
- <1, 3, 5>
- <1, 3, 7>
- <1, 3, 9>
- <1, 5, 6>
- <1, 7, 4>
- <1, 7, 8>
- <1, 7, 9>
- <1, 9, 4>
- <1, 9, 7>
- <3, 4, 6>
- <3, 4, 7>
- <3, 4, 8>
- <3, 4, 9>
- <4, 6, 5>
- <4, 6, 7>
- <4, 6, 8>
- <4, 6, 9>
- <4, 7, 8>
- <4, 7, 9>
- <4, 8, 9>
- <7, 8, 9>
- <9, 8, 4>
