Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 2) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 8) (10, 14) (10, 0) (10, 1) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 12) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 8) (19, 11) (19, 7) (8, 18) (8, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 13) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by first looking at the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: {10, 12, 15, 3}
- Node 1 has neighbors: {10, 16}
- Node 2 has neighbors: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 8, 18}
- Node 4 has neighbors: {2, 7, 12, 13, 17, 18}
- Node 5 has neighbors: {7, 9, 17}
- Node 6 has neighbors: {2, 13}
- Node 7 has neighbors: {4, 5, 13, 14, 18, 19}
- Node 8 has neighbors: {3, 18}
- Node 9 has neighbors: {2, 5, 9, 16}
- Node 10 has neighbors: {0, 1, 14}
- Node 11 has neighbors: {19}
- Node 12 has neighbors: {0, 4, 15}
- Node 13 has neighbors: {2, 4, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 14 has neighbors: {7, 10, 13}
- Node 15 has neighbors: {0, 12, 16}
- Node 16 has neighbors: {1, 9, 15}
- Node 17 has neighbors: {4, 5}
- Node 18 has neighbors: {3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 19 has neighbors: {7, 11}

Since Node 0, 4, 7, and 13 each have 6 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they are the center of:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 70, so the final answer is [70]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (3, 10, 15)>
<4, (2, 7, 13)>
<7, (5, 9, 19)>
<13, (2, 4, 6)>
