Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {6, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {8, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {9, 13, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 13}
- Node 5: {4, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 8: {2, 11, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 5, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {2, 8, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 14: {3, 8, 9, 11}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 6) + 20 (from node 9) + 10 (from node 11) = 40

Therefore, the final answer is [40], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <6, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <6, (5, 9, 12)>
- <6, (7, 9, 12)>
- <9, (0, 10, 14)>
- <9, (2, 3, 14)>
- <9, (2, 10, 14)>
- <9, (6, 10, 14)>
- <9, (6, 2, 14)>
- <11, (2, 8, 14)>
- <11, (2, 10, 14)>
- <11, (2, 14, 8)>
- <11, (8, 10, 14)>
- <11, (8, 14, 2)>
