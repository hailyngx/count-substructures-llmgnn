Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 5: 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, 6
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 9

There are 2 unique 3-stars in total, so the final answer is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are <4, (5, 9, 6)> and <6, (0, 4, 9)>.
