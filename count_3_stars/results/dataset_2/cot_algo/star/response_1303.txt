Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 2) (16, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 19) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 17) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
0 -- 5 -- 6 -- 19
|    |    |    |
7 -- 12   0 -- 15
|         |    |
10 ------ 1 -- 14
|
15
```

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 has neighbors {5, 6, 7, 10, 15}. As it has 5 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
2. Node 4 has neighbors {8, 2, 17, 3}. As it has 4 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 7 has neighbors {12, 0, 15, 10, 19}. As it has 5 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 8 has neighbors {4, 1, 18}. As it has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.
5. Node 14 has neighbors {11, 15, 2}. As it has 3 neighbors, it can form 1 3-star.
6. Node 19 has neighbors {6, 7, 15, 3, 9}. As it has 5 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 36.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 6, 10)>, <0, (5, 6, 15)>, <0, (5, 7, 10)>, <0, (5, 7, 15)>, <0, (6, 7, 10)>, <0, (6, 7, 15)>, <0, (6, 10, 15)>, <0, (7, 10, 15)>, <4, (2, 3, 17)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 17)>, <4, (3, 8, 17)>, <7, (10, 12, 15)>, <7, (10, 12, 19)>, <7, (10, 15, 19)>, <7, (12, 15, 19)>, <7, (0, 10, 15)>, <8, (1, 4, 18)>, <14, (2, 11, 15)>, <19, (3, 6, 7)>, <19, (3, 6, 9)>, <19, (3, 7, 9)>, <19, (3, 7, 15)>, <19, (6, 7, 15)>, <19, (6, 7, 19)>, <19, (6, 9, 15)>, <19, (6, 9, 19)>, <19, (7, 9, 15)>, <19, (7, 9, 19)>.
