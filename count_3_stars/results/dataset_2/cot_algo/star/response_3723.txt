Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 6, 8, 2
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 3, 9, 8, 0
- Node 3: 4, 9, 2, 5
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9, 6, 3
- Node 5: 7, 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 9, 5, 8, 0
- Node 7: 4, 0, 5
- Node 8: 4, 6, 2, 5, 0
- Node 9: 4, 3, 6, 2

Now we see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate their number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52 3-stars.

Therefore, the solution is [52] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 4>
<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 6>
<0, 3, 4>
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 4, 6>
<0, 6, 8>
<2, 3, 4>
<2, 9, 4>
<2, 4, 8>
<2, 3, 5>
<2, 4, 5>
<2, 8, 5>
<3, 4, 5>
<4, 7, 5>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 6, 5>
<4, 8, 6>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 9, 3>
<4, 9, 6>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 6, 8>
