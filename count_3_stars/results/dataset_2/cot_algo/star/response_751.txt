Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 10, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {4, 14}
- Node 4: {3, 6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 4, 10, 13}
- Node 9: {2, 5, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 4, 5, 12}
- Node 12: {9, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {3, 6, 7, 9}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: Node 0, Node 4, Node 8, Node 13 (4 choose 3) = 4
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: Node 10, Node 11 (4 choose 3) = 4
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9, Node 12, Node 14 Total = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
1. <0, 10, 11>
2. <0, 4, 8>
3. <0, 4, 10>
4. <0, 8, 13>
5. <4, 10, 6>
6. <4, 10, 11>
7. <4, 6, 13>
8. <8, 13, 10>
