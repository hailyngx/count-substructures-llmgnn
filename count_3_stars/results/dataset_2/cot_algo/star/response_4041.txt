Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 5: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 6, 8}

Now, let's apply the \( \binom{n}{3} \) formula for nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 70

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
