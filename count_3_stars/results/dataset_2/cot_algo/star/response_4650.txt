Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 16) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 10) (12, 3) (13, 18) (0, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {17}
- Node 1: {14, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {10, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {6, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 2, 15}
- Node 5: {14, 2}
- Node 6: {11, 1, 3, 16}
- Node 7: {14, 17, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 4, 16}
- Node 9: {11, 15, 18}
- Node 10: {11, 12, 8, 19, 2}
- Node 11: {10, 9, 6, 8}
- Node 12: {10, 3}
- Node 13: {18}
- Node 14: {17, 1, 15, 5, 7}
- Node 15: {14, 4, 9}
- Node 16: {8, 6, 19}
- Node 17: {14, 0, 7}
- Node 18: {9, 13}
- Node 19: {10, 16}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the number of 3-stars.

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star is formed. 
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star is formed. 
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4 3-stars are formed.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4 3-stars are formed.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4 3-stars are formed.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors: 5C3 = 10 3-stars are formed.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 4C3 = 4 3-stars are formed.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors: 5C3 = 10 3-stars are formed.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star is formed.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star is formed.

Total 3-stars formed: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 6, 7>
- <2, 4, 5>
- <6, 11, 1>
- <6, 1, 3>
- <6, 8, 16>
- <7, 14, 1>
- <7, 14, 15>
- <7, 14, 5>
- <7, 17, 1>
- <8, 10, 11>
- <8, 10, 19>
- <8, 10, 2>
- <8, 11, 6>
- <10, 11, 12>
- <10, 11, 8>
- <10, 11, 2>
- <10, 11, 9>
- <14, 15, 4>
- <14, 15, 9>
- <14, 4, 15>
