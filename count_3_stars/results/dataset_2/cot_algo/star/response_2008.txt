Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 11) (3, 20) (18, 22) (18, 10) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 0) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 6) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 19) (19, 14) (19, 16) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 12) (6, 26) (21, 27) (21, 9) (21, 12) (21, 4) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 8) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 5) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 5) (16, 19) (16, 17) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 17) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 20) (24, 11) (24, 9) (29, 4) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 12) (12, 11) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 9) (4, 21) (4, 29) (4, 9) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 12) (9, 4) (23, 15) (27, 21) (27, 5) (5, 0) (5, 25) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 27) (13, 0) (13, 25) (13, 28) (10, 1) (10, 18) (28, 14) (28, 13) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 22, 14, 5, 13
- Node 1 has neighbors: 26, 17, 10
- Node 2 has neighbors: 22, 26, 17, 20
- Node 3 has neighbors: 11, 20
- Node 4 has neighbors: 21, 29, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 0, 15, 25, 12, 27
- Node 6 has neighbors: 26
- Node 7 has neighbors: 14, 11, 25, 8
- Node 8 has neighbors: 7, 15, 17
- Node 9 has neighbors: 21, 24, 12, 4
- Node 10 has neighbors: 1, 18
- Node 11 has neighbors: 3, 24, 7, 12
- Node 12 has neighbors: 21, 20, 5, 9, 11
- Node 13 has neighbors: 0, 25, 28
- Node 14 has neighbors: 22, 28, 7, 19
- Node 15 has neighbors: 23, 8, 5
- Node 16 has neighbors: 19, 17
- Node 17 has neighbors: 16, 2, 8, 1
- Node 18 has neighbors: 22, 10
- Node 19 has neighbors: 16, 14
- Node 20 has neighbors: 3, 26, 2, 12
- Node 21 has neighbors: 27, 12, 4, 9
- Node 22 has neighbors: 0, 2, 18
- Node 23 has neighbors: 15
- Node 24 has neighbors: 11, 9
- Node 25 has neighbors: 7, 5, 13
- Node 26 has neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 20
- Node 27 has neighbors: 21, 5
- Node 28 has neighbors: 14, 13
- Node 29 has neighbors: 4

Now, we will look for nodes with three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 20: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \(4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 53\)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

Unique 3-stars found are: <0, (5, 13, 14)>, <0, (5, 22, 27)>, <0, (5, 25, 27)>, <0, (13, 14, 28)>, <2, (12, 20, 26)>, <2, (17, 20, 26)>, <2, (17, 20, 12)>, <2, (17, 20, 12)>, <5, (12, 15, 27)>, <5, (12, 25, 27)>, <5, (12, 15, 25)>, <5, (15, 25, 27)>, <7, (11, 25, 8)>, <11, (12, 21, 24)>, <12, (9, 21, 24)>, <12, (9, 4, 21)>, <12, (5, 20, 21)>, <12, (5, 9, 21)>, <14, (7, 19, 28)>, <17, (8, 16, 2)>, <17, (8, 16, 19)>, <17, (1, 2, 26)>, <17, (1, 16, 26)>, <20, (2, 12, 26)>, <20, (2, 12, 21)>, <20, (2, 12, 5)>, <20, (2, 12, 5)>, <21, (4, 9, 29)>, <26, (1, 2, 6)>, <26, (1, 6, 20)>.
