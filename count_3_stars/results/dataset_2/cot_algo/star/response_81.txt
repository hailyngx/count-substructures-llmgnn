Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

1. Node 0 neighbors: 1, 8, 11, 14
2. Node 1 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 8
3. Node 2 neighbors: 7, 12
4. Node 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9, 12
5. Node 4 neighbors: 1, 8, 13
6. Node 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 9, 10, 12, 14
7. Node 6 neighbors: 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14
8. Node 7 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 11
9. Node 8 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 14
10. Node 9 neighbors: 3, 5, 6
11. Node 10 neighbors: 5, 13
12. Node 11 neighbors: 0, 7, 14
13. Node 12 neighbors: 2, 3, 13
14. Node 13 neighbors: 4, 6, 10, 12
15. Node 14 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 8, 11

Now we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 5, 6

For node 5:
- 3-stars: 
    - <5, 1, 3, 9>
    - <5, 1, 12, 14>
    - <5, 3, 9, 12>
    - <5, 9, 10, 14>
    - <5, 9, 12, 14>

For node 6:
- 3-stars: 
    - <6, 7, 8, 13>
    - <6, 7, 11, 14>
    - <6, 8, 9, 14>
    - <6, 11, 13, 14>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. The unique 3-stars found are <5, 1, 3, 9>, <5, 1, 12, 14>, <5, 3, 9, 12>, <5, 9, 10, 14>, <6, 7, 8, 13>, <6, 7, 11, 14>, <6, 8, 9, 14>, <6, 11, 13, 14>.
