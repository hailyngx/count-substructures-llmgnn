Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 8, 9} <6, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 8, 9} <7, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
