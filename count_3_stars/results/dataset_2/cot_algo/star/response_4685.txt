Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {4, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 6}

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [50]. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 4, 6>, <1, 4, 8>, <1, 5, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <4, 6, 9>
