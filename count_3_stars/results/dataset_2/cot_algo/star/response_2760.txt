Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 10, 13}
- Node 1: {8, 14}
- Node 2: {9, 11, 3, 6}
- Node 3: {9, 4, 10, 11, 13, 2}
- Node 4: {9, 7, 12, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 12, 0, 7}
- Node 6: {8, 13, 14, 2}
- Node 7: {5, 4}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 4, 2, 11, 3}
- Node 10: {0, 3}
- Node 11: {9, 3, 14, 12, 2}
- Node 12: {5, 4, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {5, 0, 12, 6, 3}
- Node 14: {11, 6, 1, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- From the neighbor sets, node 0, node 1, and node 7 have less than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 13, 12} <=> <5, (9, 13, 12)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 4, 11} and also forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 2, 3} <=> <9, (8, 4, 11)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 7, 12} <=> <4, (9, 7, 12)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 13, 11} and also forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 4, 10} <=> <3, (9, 13, 11)>, <3, (9, 4, 10)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {8, 13, 14} <=> <6, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 6, 1} <=> <8, (9, 6, 1)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 14, 12} <=> <11, (9, 14, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
