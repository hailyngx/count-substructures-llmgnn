Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 2) (3, 12) (11, 19) (0, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 17) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 16) (16, 17) (16, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 10
- Node 1: 13, 19
- Node 2: 8, 9, 12, 15
- Node 3: 12
- Node 4: 14, 15, 17, 19
- Node 5: 7, 14, 18
- Node 6: 9, 12, 13, 14
- Node 7: 5, 14, 17
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2, 6, 18
- Node 10: 0, 12, 18
- Node 11: 19
- Node 12: 2, 3, 6, 10
- Node 13: 1, 6, 16, 17
- Node 14: 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 15: 2, 4, 19
- Node 16: 13, 17
- Node 17: 4, 7, 13, 14, 16
- Node 18: 5, 9, 10
- Node 19: 1, 11, 15

Now, we can see that nodes 1, 4, 13, and 17 each have more than 3 neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

- Node 1: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 17: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \(4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28\), which we put inside brackets as [28].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, 13, 16>
- <1, 13, 17>
- <1, 13, 4>
- <1, 13, 6>
- <4, 15, 17>
- <4, 15, 19>
- <4, 17, 13>
- <4, 17, 14>
- <4, 17, 16>
- <4, 17, 7>
- <13, 16, 17>
- <13, 16, 4>
- <13, 17, 14>
- <13, 17, 4>
- <17, 4, 14>
- <17, 4, 15>
- <17, 4, 7>
- <17, 4, 13>
- <17, 7, 14>
- <17, 7, 5>
- <1, 13, 17>
