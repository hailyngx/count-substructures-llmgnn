Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 8, 5, 4}
- Node 1: {11, 8, 5, 2, 9, 12}
- Node 2: {14, 1}
- Node 3: {5, 14, 7}
- Node 4: {13, 5, 6, 0}
- Node 5: {6, 10, 1, 4, 0, 3, 12}
- Node 6: {10, 11, 5, 4}
- Node 7: {10, 11, 8, 3}
- Node 8: {0, 12, 1, 7}
- Node 9: {13, 14, 1}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 6, 7}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 7, 1, 6}
- Node 12: {8, 13, 5, 1}
- Node 13: {12, 4, 9}
- Node 14: {11, 3, 9, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14 all have 4 or more neighbors.

We will now calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- For Node 5: [inom{7}{3}] = 35
- For Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- For Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- For Node 14: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing these up: 4 + 20 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (10, 8, 5)>
- <1, (11, 8, 5)>
- <5, (6, 10, 1)>
- <6, (10, 5, 4)>
- <7, (10, 11, 3)>
- <8, (12, 1, 7)>
- <11, (14, 7, 1)>
- <12, (13, 1, 5)>
- <14, (3, 9, 11)>
