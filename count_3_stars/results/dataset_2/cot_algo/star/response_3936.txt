Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 25) (14, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (4, 16) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 29) (7, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 20) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 29) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 18) (8, 10) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 28) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 3) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 24) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (29, 21) (29, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (5, 15) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 15) (15, 4) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 25) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 27) (20, 28) (27, 9) (27, 20) (19, 17) (19, 10) (28, 18) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {13, 14, 29}
- Node 2: {12, 23, 24}
- Node 3: {16, 17}
- Node 4: {15, 16, 20, 21}
- Node 5: {15}
- Node 6: {9, 10, 20, 25}
- Node 7: {22, 29}
- Node 8: {0, 10, 23, 24}
- Node 9: {6, 26, 27}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 19}
- Node 11: {29}
- Node 12: {0, 2}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 28}
- Node 14: {1}
- Node 15: {4, 5, 15, 24, 25}
- Node 16: {3, 4, 21}
- Node 17: {3, 19}
- Node 18: {22, 28, 29}
- Node 19: {10, 17}
- Node 20: {4, 6, 27, 28}
- Node 21: {4, 16, 21, 29}
- Node 22: {7, 18, 26}
- Node 23: {2, 8, 24, 28}
- Node 24: {8, 15, 23}
- Node 25: {6, 15, 25}
- Node 26: {9, 22, 25}
- Node 27: {20, 9}
- Node 28: {13, 18, 20, 23}
- Node 29: {1, 7, 11, 18, 21}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 15, 21, 16: <4, (15, 16, 21)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 10, 9, 25: <6, (9, 10, 25)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 23, 24, 10: <8, (23, 24, 10)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 6, 27, 22: <9, (6, 22, 27)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 0, 2, 1: <12, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 5, 24, 25: <15, (5, 24, 25)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 3, 4, 21: <16, (3, 4, 21)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 22, 29, 28: <18, (22, 28, 29)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 27, 4, 28: <20, (4, 27, 28)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, 29: <21, (1, 4, 29)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7, 26, 18: <22, (7, 18, 26)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 2, 8, 28: <23, (2, 8, 28)>

There are 11 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [11].
