Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 9) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 13) (18, 19) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
There are 7 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. So, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.
For:
- Node 3: It has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: It has 5 neighbors.
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6: It has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7: It has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: It has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- For Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up these 3-stars, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [22] and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<4, (5, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <12, (1, 6, 15)>
