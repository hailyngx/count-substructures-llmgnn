Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 21) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 4) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 21) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (28, 11) (28, 24) (29, 9) (29, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (11, 26) (11, 28) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 14) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 2) (15, 13) (15, 29) (15, 16) (15, 10) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 27) (20, 8) (2, 11) (2, 25) (22, 14) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 24) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 18) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 27) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 0) (14, 5) (14, 22) (14, 21) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 23) (23, 18) (27, 16) (27, 24) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 19) (21, 9) (21, 4) (21, 14) 

Response:
There are some nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {26, 29, 0, 21, 13}
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: {26, 8, 21, 5}
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: {13, 4, 20, 18, 7}
Node 13 has 4 neighbors: {9, 8, 5, 15}
Node 26 has 4 neighbors: {9, 25, 11, 4}
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {1, 10, 5, 18, 8}
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {3, 13, 12, 24, 14}
Node 25 has 3 neighbors: {26, 16, 2}
Node 15 has 4 neighbors: {13, 29, 16, 10}
Node 16 has 5 neighbors: {25, 15, 18, 19, 27}
Node 18 has 5 neighbors: {3, 8, 16, 10, 23}
Node 24 has 4 neighbors: {28, 5, 17, 27}
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {9, 12, 19, 21}
Node 21 has 3 neighbors: {9, 4, 14}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

For node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
For node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
For node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
For node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
For node 26: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
For node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
For node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
For node 15: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
For node 16: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]
For node 18: [inom{5}{3}] = [10]

Adding them up: [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10] = [76]

The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (26, 29, 0)>
<9, (26, 29, 13)>
<9, (26, 0, 21)>
<9, (29, 0, 21)>
<9, (29, 0, 13)>
<9, (0, 21, 13)>
<4, (26, 8, 21)>
<4, (26, 8, 5)>
<4, (8, 21, 5)>
<8, (13, 21, 4)>
<8, (13, 5, 15)>
<8, (20, 18, 7)>
<13, (9, 21, 4)>
<13, (9, 21, 8)>
<13, (21, 4, 8)>
<26, (4, 11, 25)>
<3, (1, 5, 18)>
<3, (1, 8, 18)>
<3, (5, 18, 8)>
<3, (10, 16, 15)>
<5, (12, 24, 14)>
<5, (13, 14, 21)>
<5, (13, 14, 24)>
<5, (12, 14, 21)>
<16, (19, 27, 24)>
<18, (16, 23, 10)>

The total number of unique 3-stars is [26].
