Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 16) (18, 14) (22, 26) (22, 24) (22, 3) (2, 13) (2, 20) (29, 17) (29, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 27) (23, 3) (23, 28) (0, 24) (0, 12) (0, 26) (20, 2) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 28) (26, 22) (26, 0) (26, 1) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 15) (28, 23) (28, 1) (28, 7) (28, 27) (7, 28) (7, 5) (25, 16) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 12) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 24) (16, 5) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 0) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 21) (14, 9) (14, 18) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 23) (3, 17) (3, 4) (24, 22) (24, 0) (24, 16) (24, 13) (24, 10) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 21) (21, 12) (21, 13) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 27) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 19) (5, 29) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 16) (27, 8) (27, 28) (27, 19) 

Response:
First, let's create the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {24, 12, 26}
- Node 1: {26, 5, 28}
- Node 2: {13, 20}
- Node 3: {22, 8, 23, 17, 4}
- Node 4: {11, 12, 3}
- Node 5: {29, 1, 7, 16}
- Node 6: {10, 15, 8}
- Node 7: {5, 28}
- Node 8: {6, 3, 27}
- Node 9: {14, 16}
- Node 10: {6, 12, 24, 19}
- Node 11: {17, 13, 15, 4}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 15, 21, 10}
- Node 13: {2, 11, 24, 21}
- Node 14: {9, 18}
- Node 15: {6, 11, 12}
- Node 16: {9, 25, 24, 5}
- Node 17: {29, 3, 19, 11}
- Node 18: {14}
- Node 19: {17, 10, 27}
- Node 20: {2}
- Node 21: {12, 13}
- Node 22: {26, 24, 3}
- Node 23: {3, 28}
- Node 24: {22, 0, 16, 13, 10}
- Node 25: {16}
- Node 26: {22, 0, 1}
- Node 27: {8, 28, 19}
- Node 28: {23, 1, 7, 27}
- Node 29: {17, 5}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 8, 17}.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {10, 4, 15}.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors {29, 19, 11}.
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with neighbors {22, 16, 13}.

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get [4].
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (22, 8, 17)>, <12, (10, 4, 15)>, <17, (29, 19, 11)>, <24, (22, 16, 13)>.
