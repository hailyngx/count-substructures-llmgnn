Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (4, 3) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 19) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (19, 14) (19, 18) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 9) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {8, 13}
- Node 1: {6, 11, 18}
- Node 2: {5, 15}
- Node 3: {4, 12, 16}
- Node 4: {3}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 11}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {6, 12, 13}
- Node 8: {0, 18}
- Node 9: {6, 13, 15, 16, 18}
- Node 10: {12, 14, 17}
- Node 11: {1, 5, 14, 17}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 7, 9}
- Node 14: {10, 11, 17, 19}
- Node 15: {2, 9, 17}
- Node 16: {3, 9}
- Node 17: {10, 11, 14, 15}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 9, 19}
- Node 19: {14, 18}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors will potentially form 3-stars. These are nodes: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

Finally, we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed. 

- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: No 3-star formed
- Node 5: No 3-star formed
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: No 3-star formed
- Node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 13: No 3-star formed
- Node 14: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 15: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 16: No 3-star formed
- Node 17: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, 6, 11, 17>
- <6, 9, 13, 18>
- <6, 9, 15, 17>
- <6, 11, 14, 17>
- <9, 15, 17, 18>
- <10, 14, 17, 19>
- <11, 14, 17, 19>
