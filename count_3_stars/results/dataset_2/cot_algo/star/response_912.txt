Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {11, 7, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 8, 11}
- Node 2: {1, 5, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {5, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {5, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 5, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {1, 4, 7, 10}
- Node 9: {7, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {8, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 4, 6, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 14: {3, 9, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star (5, 6, 12)
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star (7, 9, 14)
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star (8, 10, 11)
- Node 11 forms 1 3-star (11, 0, 13)

Adding these up, we have a total of [4] 3-stars:
<5, (6, 12, 5)>, <7, (9, 14, 7)>, <8, (10, 11, 8)>, <11, (13, 0, 11)>
