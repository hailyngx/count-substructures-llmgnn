Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 19) (9, 25) (9, 16) (4, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 6) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 0) (10, 11) (10, 25) (10, 29) (11, 23) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (0, 23) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 2) (6, 5) (6, 22) (17, 28) (17, 8) (17, 26) (29, 10) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 3) (21, 22) (21, 23) (21, 13) (28, 17) (28, 24) (28, 25) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 8) (2, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 13) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 29) (3, 18) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 12) (15, 14) (15, 24) (16, 9) (16, 24) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 13) (24, 28) (24, 15) (24, 16) (24, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (25, 9) (25, 10) (25, 28) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 1) (14, 15) (14, 24) (27, 22) (27, 8) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 26) (8, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: {23, 20}
- Node 1: {2, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {1, 18, 20}
- Node 3: {7, 11, 18, 29}
- Node 4: {12}
- Node 5: {6, 19}
- Node 6: {5, 22}
- Node 7: {3, 8}
- Node 8: {7, 17, 26, 27}
- Node 9: {16, 25}
- Node 10: {11, 25, 29}
- Node 11: {1, 3, 10, 12, 23}
- Node 12: {4, 11, 13, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 12, 18, 21}
- Node 14: {15, 24}
- Node 15: {14, 24}
- Node 16: {9, 24}
- Node 17: {8, 26, 28}
- Node 18: {2, 13, 3}
- Node 19: {5, 12, 29}
- Node 20: {0, 2, 29}
- Node 21: {13, 22, 23}
- Node 22: {5, 6, 21, 23, 26, 27}
- Node 23: {0, 11, 21, 22}
- Node 24: {14, 15, 16, 28}
- Node 25: {9, 10, 28}
- Node 26: {8, 17, 22}
- Node 27: {8, 22}
- Node 28: {17, 24, 25}
- Node 29: {10, 19, 20, 3}

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 13, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29 (total 18 nodes)
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = \binom{18}{3} = 816 \]

So, there are a total of [816] 3-stars in this graph.
