Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 21) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 29) (2, 3) (2, 29) (29, 15) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 25) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 9) (17, 26) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 19) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 28) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 25) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 9) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 21) (5, 28) (6, 16) (6, 5) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 24) (26, 17) (26, 21) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 5) (12, 14) (12, 23) (21, 11) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 26) (21, 22) (20, 17) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 18) (27, 22) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 22) (19, 8) (19, 13) (24, 1) (22, 21) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 0) (0, 4) (0, 22) (0, 23) (23, 3) (23, 12) (23, 0) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 2
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4
- Node 10 has degree 2
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 2
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 1
- Node 17 has degree 4
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 2
- Node 20 has degree 1
- Node 21 has degree 5
- Node 22 has degree 4
- Node 23 has degree 3
- Node 24 has degree 1
- Node 25 has degree 3
- Node 26 has degree 2
- Node 27 has degree 1
- Node 28 has degree 3
- Node 29 has degree 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (2, 18, 7)>, <3, (15, 1, 29)>, <3, (7, 4, 18)>, <3, (23, 12, 0)>, <3, (2, 29, 15)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (7, 5, 21)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 21, 28)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (21, 5, 26)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (19, 9, 13)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (18, 10, 8)>, <9, (13, 19, 8)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (10, 21, 8)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (28, 19, 8)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (29, 1, 3)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (9, 26, 20)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star: <21, (26, 5, 7)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, (25, 0, 27)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star: <28, (5, 29, 13)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 14 3-stars, so the final answer is [14].
