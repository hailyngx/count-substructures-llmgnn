Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {1, 3, 4}
Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 2: {3, 5, 8, 9}
Node 3: {0, 2, 6}
Node 4: {0, 1, 8, 9}
Node 5: {1, 2, 7, 9}
Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7: {5, 6, 9}
Node 8: {1, 2, 4, 6}
Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and count the total number of 3-stars formed with those nodes:

Node 1: 5 choose 3 = 10
Node 2: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 4: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 6: 5 choose 3 = 10
Node 8: 4 choose 3 = 4
Node 9: 5 choose 3 = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42

Therefore, the final answer is [42].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
