Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 12) (12, 8) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 0) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 13) (18, 13) (18, 3) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we can first identify the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {11, 6, 7, 17}
- Node 1: {14}
- Node 3: {4, 18, 5}
- Node 4: {7, 10, 15, 3}
- Node 5: {16, 15, 14, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 0, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 15, 19}
- Node 8: {16, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {6, 8, 15, 14}
- Node 10: {4, 19, 13}
- Node 11: {16, 0, 13}
- Node 12: {8}
- Node 13: {11, 6, 10, 18}
- Node 14: {16, 9, 1, 5}
- Node 15: {9, 4, 7, 19, 5}
- Node 16: {11, 8, 14, 5}
- Node 17: {0}
- Node 18: {13, 3}
- Node 19: {7, 10, 15}

Now, we can apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 4: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 5: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 10: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- Node 13: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 15: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- Node 16: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 19: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the final number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [41]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
- <0, 6, 11>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 17>
- <0, 7, 15>
- <4, 7, 15>
- <4, 15, 19>
- <5, 14, 16>
- <5, 14, 9>
- <5, 14, 16>
- <5, 14, 9>
- <5, 14, 16>
- <5, 15, 16>
- <5, 15, 14>
- <5, 15, 16>
- <5, 15, 14>
- <5, 15, 16>
- <9, 14, 16>
- <9, 14, 16>
