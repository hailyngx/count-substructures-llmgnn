Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighborhood set for each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 8}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, forming 1 3-star.

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of 59 3-stars in the given graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [59], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 3, 6)>
- <2, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 5, 9)>
