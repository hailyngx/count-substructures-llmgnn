Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 21) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 23) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 16) (13, 25) (13, 4) (13, 1) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 1) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 28) (16, 29) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 12) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 22) (9, 8) (9, 15) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 10) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 27) (2, 19) (2, 15) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 27) (11, 7) (11, 0) (3, 6) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 20) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 20) (19, 29) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 12) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 21) (4, 13) (4, 25) (4, 15) (12, 5) (12, 28) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 24) (14, 16) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 14) (20, 27) (20, 24) (20, 21) (21, 5) (21, 15) (21, 20) (10, 18) (10, 24) (23, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 11, 24
- Node 1: 13, 7, 14
- Node 2: 19, 15
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 13, 25, 15
- Node 5: 6, 12, 21, 0
- Node 6: 5, 3, 23
- Node 7: 25, 11, 15, 1
- Node 8: 9, 24, 22
- Node 9: 8, 15
- Node 10: 18, 24
- Node 11: 7, 0
- Node 12: 5, 28, 19
- Node 13: 25, 4, 1
- Node 14: 16, 18, 1
- Node 15: 7, 9, 2, 4, 21
- Node 16: 29, 28, 14
- Node 17: 29, 22, 26
- Node 18: 26, 14, 10
- Node 19: 29, 2, 24, 12
- Node 20: 27, 24, 21
- Node 21: 5, 15, 20
- Node 22: 17, 8, 27
- Node 23: 6
- Node 24: 8, 0, 19, 10, 20
- Node 25: 13, 7, 4, 28
- Node 26: 17, 18, 27
- Node 27: 26, 22, 20
- Node 28: 25, 16, 12
- Node 29: 17, 19, 16

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 5: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 6: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 7: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 8: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 9: 2 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 10: 2 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 12: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 13: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 14: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 15: 5 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 16: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 17: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 18: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 19: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 20: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 21: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 22: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 24: 5 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 25: 4 neighbors, can form 1 3-star
- Node 26: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 27: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 28: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star
- Node 29: 3 neighbors, cannot form a 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <5, (6, 0, 21)>
- <7, (25, 1, 11)>
- <19, (29, 24, 12)>
