Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {5, 14, 3}
- Node 1: {14, 13, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 7, 12, 9}
- Node 3: {12, 0, 13}
- Node 4: {8, 10, 2}
- Node 5: {6, 13, 0, 10, 14}
- Node 6: {8, 7, 5, 14, 10}
- Node 7: {8, 6, 2}
- Node 8: {4, 14, 11, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {12, 11, 10, 1, 2}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 11: {8, 13, 9}
- Node 12: {2, 14, 3, 9}
- Node 13: {5, 11, 3, 1}
- Node 14: {8, 12, 5, 6, 0, 1}

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: [1]
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [2]
- Node 7: [0]
- Node 8: [2]
- Node 9: [1]
- Node 10: [1]
- Node 11: [1]
- Node 12: [1]
- Node 13: [1]
- Node 14: [2]

Summing up the total number of 3-stars gives us [16]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<6, (8, 7, 5)>
<6, (8, 14, 5)>
<8, (4, 10, 6)>
<8, (11, 13, 6)>
<14, (0, 5, 6)>
<14, (1, 13, 6)>
