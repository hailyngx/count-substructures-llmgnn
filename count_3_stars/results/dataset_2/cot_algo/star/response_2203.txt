Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 9, 13}
- Node 2: {0, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 9, 13}
- Node 8: {3, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 7, 13}
- Node 10: {3}
- Node 11: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 4, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 6, 12}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 4: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 6: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (1, 9, 13)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 13)>, <13, (0, 4, 7)>.
