Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 12) (9, 17) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 5) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 10) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 15) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {3, 4, 8, 19}
2: {4, 11, 16}
3: {1, 18, 19}
4: {1, 2, 5, 19}
5: {4, 10, 18}
6: {7, 10, 12}
7: {6, 11, 15, 18}
8: {0, 1, 12, 15}
9: {17, 18}
10: {5, 6, 19}
11: {2, 7, 19}
12: {6, 8, 16}
13: {0}
14: {17}
15: {7, 8, 17}
16: {2, 12}
17: {9, 14, 15}
18: {3, 5, 7, 9}
19: {1, 3, 4, 10, 11}

Now, let's identify nodes with three or more neighbors:

1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 31

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 19)>, <1, (4, 5, 19)>, <1, (8, 12, 15)>, <1, (3, 8, 15)>, <3, (1, 18, 19)>, <4, (1, 5, 19)>, <4, (1, 2, 19)>, <4, (5, 10, 19)>, <5, (4, 10, 18)>, <6, (10, 12, 16)>, <7, (11, 15, 18)>, <8, (1, 12, 15)>, <10, (6, 19, 5)>, <18, (3, 7, 9)>, <19, (1, 11, 4)>
