Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 24) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 23) (1, 3) (1, 10) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 28) (21, 0) (21, 2) (21, 17) (12, 3) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 26) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 26) (8, 22) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (17, 21) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 5) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 13) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 0) (22, 8) (22, 26) (22, 16) (26, 27) (26, 8) (26, 22) (23, 7) (23, 20) (0, 21) (0, 28) (20, 23) (20, 13) (20, 18) (2, 4) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 14) (19, 24) (19, 13) (24, 15) (24, 19) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 16) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 16) (18, 6) (18, 20) (18, 14) (5, 29) (16, 25) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 14) (11, 4) (11, 9) (13, 29) (13, 6) (13, 20) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {21, 28}
- Node 1: {3, 10}
- Node 2: {4, 10, 14, 21}
- Node 3: {1, 12, 15, 25}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {29}
- Node 6: {13, 15, 18, 28}
- Node 7: {4, 7, 23, 29}
- Node 8: {4, 12, 22, 26}
- Node 9: {10, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 9}
- Node 12: {3, 8, 27}
- Node 13: {6, 19, 20, 29}
- Node 14: {2, 9, 16, 18}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 24}
- Node 16: {9, 14, 22, 25}
- Node 17: {21}
- Node 18: {6, 14, 20}
- Node 19: {13, 24}
- Node 20: {13, 18, 23}
- Node 21: {0, 2, 17}
- Node 22: {8, 16, 26}
- Node 23: {7, 20}
- Node 24: {15, 19}
- Node 25: {3, 16, 27, 28}
- Node 26: {8, 22, 27}
- Node 27: {12, 25, 26}
- Node 28: {6, 25, 0}
- Node 29: {7, 13, 5}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 15, 25}.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors {13, 15, 28}.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with neighbors {4, 23, 29}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {12, 22, 26}.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {10, 14, 16}.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {6, 19, 29}.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 16, 18}.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors {14, 22, 25}.
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with neighbors {13, 18, 23}.
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 17, 2}.
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors {16, 27, 28}.

The total number of 3-stars is 11, so the final answer is [11].
