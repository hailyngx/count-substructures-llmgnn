Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 7) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 7) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbor sets for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {13, 4, 14, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {5, 10}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 9, 12, 7}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 12, 10, 7}
- Node 4: {13, 12, 0, 14, 3}
- Node 5: {2, 1, 10}
- Node 6: {2}
- Node 7: {13, 14, 9, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {13, 9, 14, 12}
- Node 9: {8, 2, 11, 3, 7}
- Node 10: {5, 0, 12, 1, 3}
- Node 11: {0, 9}
- Node 12: {8, 4, 2, 10, 3}
- Node 13: {8, 4, 7, 0}
- Node 14: {8, 4, 0, 7}

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0, 4-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 2, 3-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 3, 3-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 4, 4-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7, 4-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 8, 4-stars: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9, 3-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 10, 3-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 12, 4-stars: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 13, 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 14, 3-stars: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 82

Therefore, the final answer is [82], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 14>, <0, 4, 13>, <0, 4, 12>, <0, 4, 3>, <0, 14, 8>, <2, 5, 1>, <2, 5, 10>, <3, 4, 9>, <3, 4, 12>, <3, 4, 10>, <3, 4, 7>, <4, 13, 7>, <7, 8, 13>, <7, 8, 14>, <7, 8, 9>, <7, 8, 12>, <9, 8, 13>, <9, 8, 14>, <9, 8, 12>, <9, 2, 7>, <9, 2, 3>, <10, 5, 1>, <10, 5, 3>, <10, 5, 0>, <10, 5, 12>, <12, 8, 4>, <12, 8, 10>, <12, 8, 3>, <12, 4, 2>, <12, 4, 10>, <13, 8, 4>, <13, 8, 7>, <14, 8, 4>, <14, 8, 7>
