Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 3, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {8, 9, 3}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 6, 2, 8, 0}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 9, 6, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 6, 1, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 5, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 9, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {6, 2, 3, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 7, 2, 0, 1}

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 49
