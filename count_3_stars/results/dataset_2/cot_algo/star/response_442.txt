Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node. Then, we will check if any of these nodes have three or more neighbors to form a 3-star.

The neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {10, 2, 8, 3, 13}
Node 1: {6, 2, 5, 12}
Node 2: {10, 8, 1, 0}
Node 3: {4, 11, 0}
Node 4: {6, 9, 11, 3}
Node 5: {8, 1, 14}
Node 6: {9, 1, 7, 4}
Node 7: {6, 11, 10, 13}
Node 8: {11, 2, 5, 14, 0}
Node 9: {6, 4, 14}
Node 10: {7, 11, 0, 13, 2, 14}
Node 11: {4, 7, 10, 3, 8, 12}
Node 12: {1, 11}
Node 13: {7, 10, 0}
Node 14: {9, 10, 8, 5}

Nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 have three or more neighbors, which means they have the potential to form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 10 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 11 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 73. 

Therefore, the final answer is [73]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, 2, 8>
<0, 2, 10>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 2, 3>
<0, 8, 5>
<0, 8, 14>
<0, 10, 7>
<0, 10, 13>
<0, 10, 14>
<0, 13, 7>
<2, 8, 5>
<2, 8, 14>
<2, 10, 7>
<2, 10, 13>
<2, 10, 14>
<4, 6, 9>
<4, 6, 11>
<4, 9, 14>
<4, 11, 7>
<6, 9, 14>
<7, 10, 13>
<8, 11, 14>
<10, 11, 13>
