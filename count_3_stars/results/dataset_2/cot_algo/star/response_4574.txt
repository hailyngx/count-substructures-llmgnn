Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 0) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 16) (20, 9) (20, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 21) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 17) (24, 9) (26, 23) (26, 21) (26, 17) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 25) (5, 1) (5, 21) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 23) (16, 15) (16, 27) (28, 13) (28, 1) (9, 20) (9, 24) (9, 7) (29, 0) (29, 23) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 26) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 23) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 25) (23, 26) (23, 19) (23, 29) (23, 1) (23, 14) (7, 3) (7, 9) (21, 13) (21, 2) (21, 26) (21, 5) (14, 19) (14, 23) (14, 4) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 0) (25, 5) (25, 1) (25, 6) (0, 22) (0, 15) (0, 29) (0, 12) (4, 20) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (10, 8) (10, 18) (18, 10) (18, 27) (27, 16) (27, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {22, 15, 29, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 28, 6, 25, 23}
- Node 2: {8, 5, 21, 4}
- Node 3: {11, 7}
- Node 4: {20, 2, 19, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 19, 25, 1, 21}
- Node 6: {19, 1, 25}
- Node 7: {3, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {20, 24, 7}
- Node 10: {8, 18}
- Node 11: {3, 17}
- Node 12: {15, 8, 0}
- Node 13: {22, 17, 21, 28}
- Node 14: {19, 23, 4}
- Node 15: {0, 12, 16}
- Node 16: {15, 27}
- Node 17: {13, 11, 26}
- Node 18: {10, 27}
- Node 19: {5, 4, 6, 14, 23}
- Node 20: {9, 4}
- Node 21: {2, 13, 26, 5}
- Node 22: {13, 0}
- Node 23: {26, 19, 29, 1, 14}
- Node 24: {9}
- Node 25: {5, 1, 6}
- Node 26: {23, 21, 17}
- Node 27: {16, 18}
- Node 28: {13, 1}
- Node 29: {0, 23}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, Node 8, Node 9, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 19, Node 23, and Node 25.

Next, count the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 0 unique 3-stars (has only 4 neighbors)
- Node 1: 4 unique 3-stars <1, (5, 25, 28)>, <1, (5, 21, 23)>, <1, (23, 25, 29)>, <1, (6, 25, 28)>
- Node 2: 2 unique 3-stars <2, (4, 8, 21)>, <2, (5, 21, 13)>
- Node 5: 6 unique 3-stars <5, (1, 19, 25)>, <5, (1, 5, 21)>, <5, (2, 19, 21)>, <5, (21, 23, 26)>, <5, (25, 23, 29)>, <5, (1, 23, 28)>
- Node 8: 0 unique 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 unique 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: 0 unique 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 13: 6 unique 3-stars <13, (21, 22, 28)>, <13, (17, 21, 26)>, <13, (17, 21, 28)>, <13, (17, 22, 28)>, <13, (13, 21, 28)>, <13, (13, 17, 21)>
- Node 14: 2 unique 3-stars <14, (4, 19, 23)>, <14, (19, 23, 26)>
- Node 15: 0 unique 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)
- Node 16: 0 unique 3-stars (has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 17: 2 unique 3-stars <17, (11, 13, 26)>, <17, (13, 21, 26)>
- Node 19: 10 unique 3-stars <19, (4, 6, 25)>, <19, (4, 14, 23)>, <19, (6, 14, 25)>, <19, (5, 6, 25)>, <19, (23, 25, 29)>, <19, (1, 23, 25)>, <19, (1, 5, 25)>, <19, (1, 5, 23)>, <19, (1, 6, 23)>, <19, (4, 23, 29)>
- Node 23: 3 unique 3-stars <23, (19, 25, 29)>, <23, (1, 14, 23)>, <23, (1, 19, 23)>
- Node 25: 0 unique 3-stars (has only 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 4 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 10 + 3 = 33

Therefore, the final answer is [33].
