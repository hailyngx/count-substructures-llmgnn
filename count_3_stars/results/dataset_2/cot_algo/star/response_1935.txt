Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (11, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are two nodes with exactly three neighbors: node 6 and node 14. 

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 9, 10
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 10)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 10)>, <6, (1, 9, 10)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 10)>, <6, (4, 9, 10)>, <6, (8, 9, 10)>

For node 14:
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, 12
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <14, (0, 2, 3)>, <14, (0, 2, 7)>, <14, (0, 2, 12)>, <14, (0, 3, 7)>, <14, (0, 3, 12)>, <14, (0, 7, 12)>, <14, (2, 3, 7)>, <14, (2, 3, 12)>, <14, (2, 7, 12)>, <14, (3, 7, 12)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
