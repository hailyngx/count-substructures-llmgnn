Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}
Node 1: {0, 7, 8}
Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
Node 3: {0, 6, 8, 9}
Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 7}
Node 5: {2, 4, 6}
Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 9}
Node 8: {0, 1, 2, 3}
Node 9: {0, 3, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0, Node 2, and Node 6 have 5, 6, and 5 neighbors respectively. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 = 40 

Therefore, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
