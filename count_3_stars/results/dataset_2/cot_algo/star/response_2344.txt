Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 9) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 18) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 27) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 20) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 24) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 2) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 13) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 12) (26, 17) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 13) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 18) (11, 23) (11, 19) (25, 24) (27, 1) (27, 7) (5, 23) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 3) (24, 7) (24, 23) (24, 25) (24, 6) (17, 26) (17, 5) (12, 26) (12, 5) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 19) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 29) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 2) (29, 14) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (18, 21) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 8) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 19) (13, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

1: {21, 9, 27}
21: {1, 18}
4: {7}
7: {4, 24, 19, 27}
22: {23, 15, 20}
23: {22, 11, 5, 15, 24}
0: {20, 28, 2}
20: {22, 0, 13}
26: {28, 5, 12, 17}
28: {0, 26, 9, 13}
15: {22, 23, 18}
11: {23, 19}
25: {24}
27: {1, 7}
5: {23, 26, 12, 18, 17}
6: {24, 10, 3}
17: {26, 5}
12: {26, 5, 16, 8}
16: {12, 19}
3: {6, 14, 2}
19: {7, 11, 16, 13}
14: {3, 2, 29}
9: {1, 28, 2}
29: {14}
2: {0, 3, 14, 9}
10: {6, 13}
18: {21, 15, 5, 8}
13: {20, 28, 19, 10}
8: {12, 18}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors
- Node 23 has 5 neighbors
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors
-  Node 28 has 4 neighbors
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors
-  Node 5 has 5  neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors
-  Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars that can be formed:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 49\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [49].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, 9, 27>
<7, 4, 24>
<7, 19, 27>
<7, 24, 25>
<22, 23, 15>
<22, 23, 20>
<23, 5, 15>
<23, 5, 24>
<23, 5, 18>
<0, 20, 28>
<26, 5, 12>
<26, 5, 17>
<26, 12, 8>
<26, 12, 16>
<28, 9, 13>
<28, 13, 10>
<15, 22, 18>
<11, 19, 16>
<3, 6, 10>
<3, 6, 24>
<3, 14, 2>
<19, 13, 10>
<19, 13, 20>
<19, 16, 12>
<14, 2, 29>
<2, 9, 28>
<18, 15, 8>
