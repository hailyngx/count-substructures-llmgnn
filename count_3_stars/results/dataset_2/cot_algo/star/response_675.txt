Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 6}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4}

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 6}.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 8, 9}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 8, 9}.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 4, 6}.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 2, 4}.

So, there are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in this graph, and the final answer is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>.
