Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 6) (17, 3) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 14) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 3) (1, 8) (1, 16) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: {2, 13}
Node 1: {8, 16}
Node 2: {0, 9, 14}
Node 3: {6, 12, 17}
Node 4: {8, 19}
Node 5: {8, 10, 11, 15}
Node 6: {3, 7, 15}
Node 7: {6, 9, 12}
Node 8: {1, 4, 5, 14}
Node 9: {2, 7, 15, 18}
Node 10: {5, 11, 13}
Node 11: {5, 10, 18}
Node 12: {3, 7, 14, 16}
Node 13: {0, 10}
Node 14: {2, 8, 12, 19}
Node 15: {5, 6, 9}
Node 16: {1, 12, 18}
Node 17: {3}
Node 18: {9, 11, 16, 19}
Node 19: {4, 14, 18}

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:
Node 5 forms the 3-star <5, (8, 10, 11)>.
Node 9 forms the 3-star <9, (7, 15, 18)>.
Node 12 forms the 3-star <12, (3, 7, 14)>.
Node 14 forms the 3-star <14, (2, 8, 19)>.
Node 15 forms the 3-star <15, (6, 9, 5)>.
Node 18 forms the 3-star <18, (11, 16, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [6].
