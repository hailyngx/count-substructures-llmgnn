Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 2) (6, 24) (6, 3) (6, 16) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (25, 13) (25, 14) (25, 2) (10, 4) (10, 14) (17, 12) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 22) (4, 28) (4, 29) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 5) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 16) (0, 21) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 18) (7, 22) (20, 14) (20, 23) (29, 9) (29, 4) (16, 6) (16, 28) (16, 24) (1, 11) (1, 23) (1, 13) (22, 4) (22, 7) (22, 24) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 12) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 27) (18, 15) (15, 26) (15, 18) (15, 19) (19, 15) (2, 26) (2, 3) (2, 25) (21, 9) (21, 0) (13, 25) (13, 1) (13, 23) (13, 27) (27, 18) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 23) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 24) (23, 20) (23, 1) (23, 13) (23, 27) (14, 25) (14, 10) (14, 20) (5, 11) (5, 27) 

Response:
First, we will create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:
   
Node 0: 21

Node 1: 11, 13, 23

Node 2: 3, 25, 26

Node 3: 2, 6, 12

Node 4: 10, 22, 28, 29

Node 5: 11, 27

Node 6: 3, 16, 24

Node 7: 8, 17, 18, 22

Node 8: 7, 11, 18

Node 9: 18, 21, 26, 29

Node 10: 4, 14

Node 11: 1, 5, 8

Node 12: 3, 17, 24

Node 13: 1, 23, 25, 27

Node 14: 10, 20, 25

Node 15: 18, 19, 26

Node 16: 6, 24, 26

Node 17: 7, 12

Node 18: 7, 8, 9, 15, 18

Node 19: 15

Node 20: 14, 23

Node 21: 0, 9

Node 22: 4, 7, 24

Node 23: 1, 13, 20, 27

Node 24: 6, 12, 16, 22

Node 25: 2, 13, 14

Node 26: 2, 9, 15, 16

Node 27: 5, 13, 23, 27

Node 28: 4, 16, 26

Node 29: 4, 9

Next, we will count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. To do this, we will count the number of nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 10, 17, 19, 20

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars = [inom{5}{3}]

Total number of 3-stars = [10]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 21, 9>
<10, 4, 28>
<17, 7, 8>
<19, 15, 26>
<20, 14, 25>
