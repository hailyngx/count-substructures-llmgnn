Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

1: {6, 3, 5}
2: {4, 6, 0, 5}
3: {7, 1, 0, 9}
4: {7, 8, 2}
5: {7, 8, 0, 2}
6: {7, 1, 8, 0, 2}
7: {4, 8, 6, 0, 3, 5}
8: {4, 7, 6, 5}
9: {3}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 1 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 2 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 3 does not have 3 or more neighbors.
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
Node 7 forms 6 3-stars.
Node 8 forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 does not have 3 or more neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1] = [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<4, 7, 8>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 8>
<7, 4, 8>
<7, 6, 8>
<7, 0, 5>
<7, 0, 6>
<7, 3, 1>
<7, 3, 5>
