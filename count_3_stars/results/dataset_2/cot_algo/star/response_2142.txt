Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 5) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are 2 nodes with less than 3 neighbors: \{4\} and \{14\}. 
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: \{0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13\}.

Now we will calculate the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:
- For node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star.
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
- For node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.

Adding all these possibilities together: 20 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 85

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 14)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 14)>, <0, (1, 7, 14)>, <0, (2, 5, 14)>, <0, (3, 7, 14)>, <0, (4, 13, 6)>, <0, (4, 13, 11)>, <0, (5, 7, 12)>, <0, (5, 8, 11)>, <0, (5, 10, 2)>, <0, (5, 10, 13)>, <0, (8, 11, 13)>, <0, (7, 12, 6)>, <0, (7, 12, 8)>, <0, (8, 12, 5)>, <0, (9, 6, 13)>, <0, (9, 8, 12)>, <0, (13, 4, 11)>, <0, (14, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 13)>, <2, (0, 10, 5)>, <2, (5, 8, 11)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 12)>, <5, (2, 8, 11)>, <5, (2, 10, 13)>, <5, (8, 10, 13)>, <6, (0, 12, 7)>, <6, (9, 8, 13)>, <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 12, 5)>, <7, (1, 14, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (2, 10, 13)>, <7, (8, 12, 5)>, <8, (0, 11, 13)>, <8, (5, 10, 13)>, <8, (7, 12, 5)>, <8, (9, 12, 6)>, <8, (9, 13, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 13)>, <9, (8, 12, 6)>, <11, (0, 13, 4)>, <11, (6, 7, 12)>, <11, (6, 8, 12)>, <11, (7, 12, 5)>, <11, (8, 12, 5)>, <12, (0, 6, 7)>, <12, (7, 8, 5)>, <13, (0, 4, 11)>.
