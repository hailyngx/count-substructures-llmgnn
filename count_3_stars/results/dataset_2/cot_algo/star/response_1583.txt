Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 15) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 2) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 0) (6, 4) (6, 19) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 19) (2, 0) (2, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
Node 0: 5, 7, 3, 2
Node 1: 5, 7
Node 2: 0, 16
Node 3: 13, 18, 0
Node 4: 10, 18, 6
Node 5: 8, 1, 17, 0
Node 6: 4, 19
Node 7: 1, 0, 15
Node 8: 5, 16, 12
Node 10: 11, 15, 4
Node 11: 10, 19, 13
Node 12: 8, 17
Node 13: 11, 16, 3
Node 14: 18, 15, 19
Node 15: 10, 17, 7, 14
Node 16: 8, 13, 2
Node 17: 5, 18, 12, 15
Node 18: 4, 19, 17, 3, 14
Node 19: 11, 18, 14, 6

Nodes 5, 10, 13, 18 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of.
For each of these nodes, the number of unique 3-stars they are part of:

Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 16
Therefore, the final answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (8, 16, 2)>
<5, (8, 12, 17)>
<5, (1, 7, 15)>
<5, (17, 18, 4)>
<10, (11, 19, 14)>
<13, (11, 16, 3)>
<18, (4, 19, 6)>
<18, (19, 14, 15)>
<18, (14, 15, 19)>
<18, (3, 0, 7)>
