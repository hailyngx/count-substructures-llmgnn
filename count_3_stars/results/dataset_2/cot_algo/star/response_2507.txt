Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 12) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 6) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 17) (20, 12) (20, 21) (25, 17) (25, 12) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 24) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 0) (17, 7) (17, 25) (17, 1) (17, 3) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 3) (21, 20) (21, 6) (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16) (10, 29) (2, 22) (2, 26) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 27) (28, 8) (28, 0) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 12) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (5, 0) (5, 16) (27, 19) (27, 18) (27, 26) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 26) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 29) (26, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 12) (12, 13) (12, 20) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 0) (24, 8) (24, 15) (24, 18) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 9) (18, 7) (18, 27) (18, 24) (14, 1) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 26) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 5, 12, 19, 28}
- Node 1: {0, 14, 15, 17}
- Node 2: {6, 22, 26}
- Node 3: {6, 17, 23, 29}
- Node 4: {16, 19, 23}
- Node 5: {0, 16}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 21, 22}
- Node 7: {11, 17, 18}
- Node 8: {13, 24, 28}
- Node 9: {14, 23}
- Node 10: {29}
- Node 11: {7, 12, 26}
- Node 12: {0, 11, 13, 20, 25}
- Node 13: {8, 12, 22}
- Node 14: {1, 9}
- Node 15: {1, 16, 24}
- Node 16: {4, 5, 15, 26}
- Node 17: {1, 3, 7, 25}
- Node 18: {7, 24, 27}
- Node 19: {0, 4, 27}
- Node 20: {12, 21}
- Node 21: {6, 20}
- Node 22: {2, 6, 13}
- Node 23: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 24: {8, 15, 18}
- Node 25: {12, 17}
- Node 26: {2, 11, 16, 27, 29}
- Node 27: {18, 19, 26}
- Node 28: {0, 8}
- Node 29: {3, 10, 26}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors
- Node 26 has 5 neighbors

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 26: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 24 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [24].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <12, (0, 11, 25)>
- <17, (1, 7, 25)>
- <26, (2, 16, 27)>
