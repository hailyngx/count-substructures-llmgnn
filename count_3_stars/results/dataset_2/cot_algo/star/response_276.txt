Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 5) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 18) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (17, 15) (17, 12) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {15, 10}
- Node 1: {16, 9, 18, 15}
- Node 2: {5, 19, 12}
- Node 3: {9, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 18, 12}
- Node 5: {16, 19, 2, 14}
- Node 6: {18}
- Node 7: {9, 4, 18}
- Node 8: {11, 16, 15, 3, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 1, 7}
- Node 10: {15, 19, 0, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 2, 13, 17}
- Node 13: {10, 12}
- Node 14: {5, 8}
- Node 15: {1, 10, 0, 8, 17}
- Node 16: {1, 8, 5, 19}
- Node 17: {15, 12}
- Node 18: {6, 4, 7, 1}
- Node 19: {5, 2, 10}

Next, we need to identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors to check for 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 13, 17, 19
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 10
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: 4
- Nodes with 5 or more neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 3 neighbors:
- We have 5 nodes with 3 neighbors, which gives us \( 5 \times \binom{3}{3} = 5 \) 3-stars.

For nodes with 4 neighbors:
- We have 2 nodes with 4 neighbors, which gives us \( 2 \times \binom{4}{3} = 8 \) 3-stars.

For nodes with 5 neighbors:
- We have 1 node with 5 neighbors, which gives us \( 1 \times \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For nodes with 5 or more neighbors:
- We have 8 nodes to consider.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Total = \( 5 + 8 + 10 + 8 \) 3-stars = 31 3-stars

Therefore, the final answer is [31], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (15, 8, 16)>, <4, (7, 12, 18)>, <5, (2, 14, 19)>, <8, (15, 16, 5)>, <12, (2, 13, 17)>.
