Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 11}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 10, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 8, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 4, 6, 11}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 11, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 10}
- Node 13: {5, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 9}

From this information, we see that nodes 5, 10, and 11 have 4 or more neighbors, so we can form 3-stars with these nodes.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 5, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 10, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For node 11, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 4 + 10 + 20 = 34 \).

Thus, the answer is [34], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (1, 10, 13)>
<10, (2, 4, 5)>
<11, (1, 6, 8)>
<11, (2, 9, 10)>
