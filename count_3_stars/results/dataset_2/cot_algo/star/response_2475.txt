Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 15) (18, 10) (18, 24) (22, 3) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 13) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 25) (17, 28) (17, 2) (1, 25) (1, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 27) (8, 29) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 27) (9, 8) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 23) (6, 0) (24, 18) (24, 3) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 15) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 25) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 3) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 24) (3, 10) (23, 16) (23, 2) (23, 4) (20, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 15) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 12) (25, 21) (25, 28) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 14) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 8) (13, 28) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 13) (2, 21) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 23) 

Response:
The total number of nodes in the graph is \( n = 30 \).

Let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 1: {4, 25}
- Node 2: {17, 21, 16, 23}
- Node 3: {8, 10, 24}
- Node 4: {1, 11, 13, 23}
- Node 5: {0, 14, 19, 27}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {15, 16, 21}
- Node 8: {3, 8, 9, 14, 27, 29}
- Node 9: {8, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 18}
- Node 11: {4, 14, 15}
- Node 12: {0, 9, 15, 20}
- Node 13: {0, 4, 28}
- Node 14: {5, 8, 11, 25}
- Node 15: {7, 11, 12, 21}
- Node 16: {2, 7, 13, 21, 23}
- Node 17: {2, 21}
- Node 18: {10, 24}
- Node 19: {5, 27}
- Node 20: {12}
- Node 21: {2, 7, 15, 17, 25, 27}
- Node 22: {3}
- Node 23: {2, 4, 16}
- Node 24: {3, 18}
- Node 25: {1, 14, 21, 25, 28, 29}
- Node 26: Not present in the graph
- Node 27: {5, 8, 19, 21}
- Node 28: {13, 17, 25, 29}
- Node 29: {8, 25, 28}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0, 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 25, 28, and 29 have at least 3 neighbors.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
- Node 12: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( C(5, 3) = 10 \)
- Node 21: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
- Node 25: \( C(6, 3) = 20 \)
- Node 28: \( C(4, 3) = 4 \)
- Node 29: \( C(3, 3) = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 93

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \([93]\).
