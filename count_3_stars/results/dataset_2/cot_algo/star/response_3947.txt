Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (11, 17) (11, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 15) (0, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (16, 10) (16, 13) (19, 9) (19, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 15, 18, 19
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 7, 9, 12
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 18
- Node 3 has neighbors: 2, 8, 10
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 8, 13, 15
- Node 5 has neighbors: 6
- Node 6 has neighbors: 5
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 11, 14
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 12, 18
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 18, 19
- Node 10 has neighbors: 3, 15, 16, 17
- Node 11 has neighbors: 7, 17
- Node 12 has neighbors: 1, 8, 13
- Node 13 has neighbors: 4, 12, 14, 16
- Node 14 has neighbors: 7, 13
- Node 15 has neighbors: 0, 4, 10
- Node 16 has neighbors: 10, 13
- Node 17 has neighbors: 10, 11
- Node 18 has neighbors: 2, 8, 9, 0
- Node 19 has neighbors: 9, 0

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Nodes 5 and 6 have less than 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors, so [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors, so 0 3-stars

Summing up, we have a total of 30 3-stars. 

Thus, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 4, 15>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 4, 19>, <0, 15, 19>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 7, 12>, <1, 9, 12>, <2, 8, 12>, <2, 8, 18>, <2, 12, 18>, <4, 12, 13>, <8, 12, 18>, <10, 15, 17>, <10, 15, 4>, <10, 15, 16>, <10, 16, 13>, <13, 14, 16>, <13, 14, 7>, <14, 7, 13>, <18, 0, 9>
