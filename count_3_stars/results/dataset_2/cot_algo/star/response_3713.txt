Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 10
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 10, 12
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10
- Node 3: 2, 6, 8, 10, 13
- Node 4: 0, 1, 14
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9, 11
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 11
- Node 7: 12, 13
- Node 8: 3, 12, 13
- Node 9: 0, 5, 10
- Node 10: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9, 12
- Node 11: 5, 6, 12, 14
- Node 12: 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13
- Node 13: 3, 7, 8, 12
- Node 14: 4, 11

Next, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 10: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 11: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 13: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 14: 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 94

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [94].

- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 10)>
- <0, (4, 10, 12)>

- <2, (0, 1, 10)>
- <3, (2, 6, 10)>
- <5, (0, 6, 11)>
- <6, (2, 3, 10)>
- <10, (0, 1, 12)>
- <10, (0, 2, 4)>
- <10, (0, 2, 5)>
- <10, (1, 2, 12)>
- <12, (0, 1, 10)>
- <12, (0, 7, 8)>
