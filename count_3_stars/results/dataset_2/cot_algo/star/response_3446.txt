Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 3, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 4, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 4, 7, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 51

Therefore, the final answer is [51], and the unique 3-stars found are:

- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <7, (8, 9, 2)>
- <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 2)>
- <9, (1, 2, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 4)>
