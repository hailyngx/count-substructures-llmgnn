Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 22) (27, 10) (27, 28) (27, 17) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 5) (21, 19) (21, 18) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 14) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 24) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 16) (8, 16) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 15) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 1) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 15) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (26, 18) (26, 5) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 20) (25, 7) (25, 23) (9, 7) (9, 2) (20, 5) (20, 14) (20, 11) (20, 10) (29, 12) (29, 24) (2, 22) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 11) (19, 21) (19, 18) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (1, 28) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 15) (24, 23) (24, 29) (14, 22) (14, 20) (10, 27) (10, 6) (10, 20) (10, 2) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 2) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 16) (12, 29) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {3, 17, 22}
- Node 1: {28}
- Node 2: {9, 10, 11, 17, 22}
- Node 3: {0, 6, 13, 12}
- Node 4: {18, 16, 22}
- Node 5: {7, 13, 20, 26}
- Node 6: {3, 10, 15, 27, 28}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 11, 25}
- Node 8: {16}
- Node 9: {2, 7}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 20, 27}
- Node 11: {2, 7, 13, 20}
- Node 12: {3, 29}
- Node 13: {3, 5, 11}
- Node 14: {20, 22}
- Node 15: {6, 16, 18}
- Node 16: {4, 8, 15}
- Node 17: {0, 2, 27}
- Node 18: {4, 15, 19, 21, 26}
- Node 19: {18, 21}
- Node 20: {5, 10, 11, 14}
- Node 21: {18, 19}
- Node 22: {0, 2, 4, 14, 23}
- Node 23: {22, 24, 25}
- Node 24: {23, 29}
- Node 25: {7, 23}
- Node 26: {5, 18}
- Node 27: {6, 10, 17, 28}
- Node 28: {1, 6, 27}
- Node 29: {12, 24}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each:

- Node 0, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 10, Node 11, Node 13, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 20, Node 22, Node 23, Node 25, and Node 27 have 3 or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes: 
\( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \)

Summing these up, we find a total of 113 3-stars.
Therefore, the final number to be presented inside brackets is [113].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (9, 10, 17)>
- <3, (0, 6, 13)>
- <4, (16, 18, 22)>
- <5, (7, 13, 20)>
- <6, (3, 10, 28)>
- <7, (5, 11, 20)>
- <10, (2, 6, 20)>
- <11, (2, 7, 13)>
- <13, (3, 5, 11)>
- <15, (6, 16, 18)>
- <16, (4, 8, 15)>
- <17, (0, 2, 27)>
- <18, (4, 15, 19)>
- <20, (5, 10, 11)>
- <22, (4, 14, 23)>
- <23, (22, 24, 25)>
- <25, (7, 23, 27)>
- <27, (6, 10, 28)>
