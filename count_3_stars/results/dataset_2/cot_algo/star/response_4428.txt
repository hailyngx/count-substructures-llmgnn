Node 29: {0, 17, 12, 18}

Nodes 3, 8, 15, 16, 18, and 25 have 5 or more neighbors, so let's calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    <3, (15, 21, 16)>  <3, (15, 21, 8)>  <3, (15, 16, 8)>  <3, (21, 16, 8)>  <3, (15, 16, 18)>
    <3, (15, 16, 6)>  <3, (15, 16, 25)>  <3, (21, 16, 25)>  <3, (15, 8, 18)>  <3, (21, 8, 18)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <8, (3, 16, 21)>  <8, (3, 15, 16)>  <8, (3, 16, 26)>  <8, (3, 16, 18)>

- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <15, (3, 21, 16)>  <15, (3, 21, 8)>  <15, (3, 16, 7)>  <15, (3, 16, 25)>

- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <16, (3, 8, 21)>  <16, (3, 8, 26)>  <16, (3, 8, 18)>  <16, (3, 21, 26)> 

- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <18, (3, 29, 5)>  <18, (3, 29, 20)>  <18, (3, 5, 20)>  <18, (29, 5, 20)>

- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    <25, (3, 15, 24)>  <25, (3, 15, 6)>  <25, (15, 24, 6)>  <25, (15, 24, 22)>

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
