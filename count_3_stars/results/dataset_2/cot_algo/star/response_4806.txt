Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9, 2, 8}
- Node 1: {4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 9, 5, 8, 0}
- Node 3: {4, 0, 5, 8}
- Node 4: {7, 1, 3, 2}
- Node 5: {7, 3, 6, 2}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 5}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 9, 2, 0}
- Node 9: {7, 1, 8, 2, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 2: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 5, 8)>, <2, (9, 5, 0)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 5, 8)>, <2, (9, 5, 8)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>
- Node 3: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 4: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 3)>, <4, (2, 1, 3)>, <4, (7, 2, 3)>
- Node 5: It has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <5, (7, 3, 6)>, <5, (7, 3, 2)>, <5, (7, 6, 2)>, <5, (3, 6, 2)>
- Node 6: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 7: It has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star. <7, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 8: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 2, 9)>, <8, (3, 0, 9)>, <8, (6, 2, 9)>, <8, (6, 0, 9)>, <8, (2, 0, 9)>, <8, (6, 2, 9)>, <8, (6, 0, 9)>, <8, (2, 0, 9)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>
- Node 9: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <9, (7, 1, 8)>, <9, (7, 1, 2)>, <9, (7, 1, 0)>, <9, (8, 1, 2)>, <9, (8, 1, 0)>, <9, (2, 1, 0)>, <9, (8, 1, 2)>, <9, (8, 1, 0)>, <9, (2, 1, 0)>, <9, (8, 2, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 49

Putting the final number inside brackets gives us [49].
