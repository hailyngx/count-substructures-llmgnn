Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, we'll start by listing the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8
Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 13
Node 3: 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12
Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 13
Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 8, 13
Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 10
Node 7: 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12
Node 8: 1, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13
Node 9: 0, 3, 9, 10, 13
Node 10: 6, 8, 9, 11
Node 11: 7, 8, 10
Node 12: 3, 7
Node 13: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 3: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 7: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 10: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 13: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \(20 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 92\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 13)>
<8, (5, 8, 13)>
<9, (0, 9, 13)>
<10, (6, 9, 10)>
<13, (2, 5, 8)>
