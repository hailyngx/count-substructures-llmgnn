This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 8) (27, 14) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 6) (25, 23) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 10) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 29) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 21) (9, 25) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 28) (7, 17) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 21) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 13) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 20) (13, 9) (13, 18) (26, 10) (26, 29) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 1) (19, 15) (19, 10) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 1) (17, 15) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 7) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 19) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (21, 5) (21, 4) (21, 24) (24, 21) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 29) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (28, 20) (28, 7) (28, 14) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 28) 

Response:
Calculating the degree of each node:

- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 1
- Node 25: degree 5
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 1
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

Identifying nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 5
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Calculating for Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Calculating for Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculating for Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Calculating for Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculating for Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculating for Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculating for Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculating for Node 25: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding them up: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

Unique 3-stars: 
<3, (15, 25, 11)>
<5, (9, 25, 11)>
<9, (25, 5, 4)>
<10, (22, 7, 19)>
<17, (15, 25, 23)>
<18, (3, 4, 13)>
<25, (3, 15, 17)>
