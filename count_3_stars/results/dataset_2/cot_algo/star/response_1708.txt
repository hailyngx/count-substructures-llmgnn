Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 10) (17, 23) (17, 15) (20, 22) (20, 11) (25, 27) (25, 18) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 16) (10, 29) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 29) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 9) (1, 15) (1, 23) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 2) (21, 14) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 9) (0, 29) (0, 19) (16, 10) (16, 24) (16, 3) (16, 27) (26, 5) (26, 2) (26, 12) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 2) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 18) (27, 13) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 22) (8, 7) (3, 16) (7, 8) (7, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 8) (18, 25) (18, 27) (18, 7) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 19) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 24) (4, 9) (9, 28) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 19) (19, 0) (19, 23) (19, 9) (19, 12) (13, 24) (13, 27) (11, 20) (11, 6) (29, 10) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 12) (12, 26) (12, 19) (12, 29) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {29, 19}
- Node 1: {23, 15}
- Node 2: {26, 15, 24}
- Node 3: {16}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {29, 6, 26}
- Node 6: {29, 5, 11, 28}
- Node 7: {8, 18}
- Node 8: {15, 22, 28, 7}
- Node 9: {29, 21, 4, 19}
- Node 10: {29, 21, 16, 17}
- Node 11: {20, 6}
- Node 12: {26, 19, 29}
- Node 13: {24, 27}
- Node 14: {21, 23}
- Node 15: {1, 17, 8, 2}
- Node 16: {3, 10, 27}
- Node 17: {10, 23, 15}
- Node 18: {25, 27, 7}
- Node 19: {0, 9, 23, 12}
- Node 20: {22, 11}
- Node 21: {14, 10, 27, 9}
- Node 22: {20, 24, 8}
- Node 23: {14, 17, 1, 19}
- Node 24: {16, 22, 13, 2}
- Node 25: {27, 18}
- Node 26: {5, 2, 12}
- Node 27: {25, 16, 13, 21, 18}
- Node 28: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 29: {0, 5, 10, 12}

Now, let's identify any nodes that have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 10, Node 12, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 19, Node 21, Node 23, Node 27, Node 28, and Node 29 form 3-stars.

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars formed:

- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 28: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 29: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<6, (5, 11, 28)>
<9, (19, 21, 29)>
<10, (17, 21, 29)>
<12, (19, 26, 29)>
<15, (8, 17, 2)>
<16, (10, 27, 3)>
<17, (10, 15, 23)>
<19, (0, 9, 23)>
<21, (9, 27, 10)>
<23, (14, 17, 19)>
<27, (13, 16, 21)>
<28, (8, 9, 6)>
<29, (0, 10, 12)>
