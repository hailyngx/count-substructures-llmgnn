Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 7) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 17) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 13) (6, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 17) (1, 2) (1, 19) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 16) (14, 18) (8, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 18) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's first list out the neighbor nodes for each node:

1: 2, 19
2: 1, 3, 15, 9, 13
3: 2
4: 7, 9, 17
5: 6, 9, 12, 14
6: 5, 13, 16, 19
7: 4, 15, 17
8: 12
9: 4, 5, 2, 17
10: 0, 12, 14
11: 18
12: 5, 10, 8
13: 6, 2
14: 5, 10, 16, 18
15: 7, 2
16: 6, 0, 19, 14
17: 4, 7, 9, 18
18: 11, 14, 17
19: 6, 0, 16, 1

Now let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 2, 9, 14, 16, and 17 each have 5 neighbors, giving \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, giving \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Nodes 4, 7, 12, and 19 each have 3 neighbors, giving 1 3-star for each.
- No other nodes have 3 or more neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, 5, 9>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 5, 16>, <2, 5, 17>, <2, 9, 14>, <2, 9, 16>, <2, 9, 17>, <2, 14, 16>, <2, 14, 17>, <2, 16, 17>, <5, 9, 14>, <5, 9, 16>, <5, 9, 17>, <5, 14, 16>, <5, 14, 18>, <5, 16, 18>, <9, 14, 16>, <9, 14, 17>, <9, 16, 17>, <14, 16, 18>.
