Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {1, 4, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0: [3-star found] with <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 1: [3-star found] with <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (1, 9, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (1, 3, 2)>
- Node 2: [3-star found] with <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 3: [3-star found] with <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (3, 1, 8)>
- Node 4: [3-star found] with <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 9, 7)>, <4, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 5: [3-star found] with <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (5, 6, 7)>, <5, (5, 2, 8)>
- Node 6: [3-star found] with <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (6, 5, 8)>
- Node 7: [3-star found] with <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (7, 4, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: [3-star found] with <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 9: [3-star found] with <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 7, 1)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars: [18]
