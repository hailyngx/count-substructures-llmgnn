Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {3, 12, 2}
Node 1: {5, 6, 10, 13, 8}
Node 2: {0, 6, 13}
Node 3: {9, 6, 0, 8, 4}
Node 4: {5, 9, 3, 12}
Node 5: {9, 12, 1, 4, 10}
Node 6: {1, 3, 7, 2, 11, 13}
Node 7: {11, 6, 14}
Node 8: {1, 3, 14, 10}
Node 9: {5, 4, 10, 13, 3}
Node 10: {5, 9, 1, 8}
Node 11: {7, 6, 14}
Node 12: {5, 4, 0}
Node 13: {9, 1, 6, 2}
Node 14: {7, 11, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:
Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 8
Nodes with 5 neighbors: 5, 9, 10, 13
Nodes with 6 neighbors: 6

For each of the nodes with 4, 5, or 6 neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

Nodes with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
Nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
Node 6 with 6 neighbors: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = (4*4) + (4*10) + (4*10) + 20 = 16 + 40 + 40 + 20 = 116

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [116].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 6, 10)>
<3, (9, 6, 0)>
<4, (5, 3, 12)>
<8, (1, 3, 14)>
<5, (9, 10, 13)>
<9, (5, 1, 13)>
<10, (9, 1, 8)>
<13, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 6, 13)>
