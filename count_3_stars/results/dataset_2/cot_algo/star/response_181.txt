Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes in the graph, and the edges are as given. Let's first find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: (1, 5, 6)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 4, 9)
- Node 2: (4, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 3: (1, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 4: (1, 2, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 5: (0, 2, 8)
- Node 6: (0, 2, 3, 7, 9)
- Node 7: (4, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 3, 6, 7)

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 7, 4)>

In this graph, there are a total of 11 unique 3-stars formed as listed above. So the total number of 3-stars is [11].
