Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
The central idea of this problem is to find the count of 3-stars in the given graph by examining the neighbor nodes for each node.

After analyzing the provided graph, we can determine the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {5, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 11, 12}
- Node 2: {4, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 4: {2, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {8, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 5, 9, 10}

Now, let's calculate the count of 3-stars in the graph:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 13, 14 (Total: 8)
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)

So, the final answer is [56].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 11, 14)>
<1, (7, 11, 12)>
<2, (4, 8, 11)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<10, (8, 12, 14)>
<12, (1, 3, 10)>
<13, (2, 7, 9)>
<14, (0, 5, 9)>
