Response:
Given the provided information, let's first identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 17.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 23, 27.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 16, 17, 24, 27.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 13, 16.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 17.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 14, 26.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 15, 26.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 18, 19, 29.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 20, 28.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 15, 26.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 25.
- Node 12 is connected to node 15.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 17, 21.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 19, 20.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 12.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 4.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 13.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 8, 24, 25.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 8, 14, 27, 28.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 22, 25.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 13, 0, 28.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 20, 25, 26.
- Node 23 is connected to node 1.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 2, 18.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 11, 18, 20, 22.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 10, 22.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 19, 29.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 9, 19, 21.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 27, 8.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each node:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 20 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <8, 11, 18, 25>
- <8, 11, 25, 22>
- <8, 18, 25, 22>
- <19, 8, 18, 25>
- <19, 8, 25, 22>
