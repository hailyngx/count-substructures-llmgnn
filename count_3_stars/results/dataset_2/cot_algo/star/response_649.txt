Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 6) (12, 20) (12, 23) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 20) (27, 17) (20, 12) (20, 27) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 0) (28, 5) (28, 10) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 21) (18, 16) (18, 4) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 28) (5, 25) (5, 0) (17, 27) (17, 24) (17, 23) (29, 9) (29, 26) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 16) (8, 3) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 19) (10, 28) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 13) (19, 21) (19, 14) (19, 24) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 22) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 26) (23, 24) (23, 13) (26, 29) (26, 23) (1, 0) (1, 22) (24, 3) (24, 17) (24, 19) (24, 23) (24, 13) (14, 27) (14, 19) (13, 9) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 25) (25, 5) (25, 13) (25, 22) (22, 11) (22, 7) (22, 1) (22, 25) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 22}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 7, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 15, 24}
- Node 4: {18, 21, 27}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 11, 25, 28}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 15, 21}
- Node 7: {2, 16, 22}
- Node 8: {3, 16}
- Node 9: {11, 13, 29}
- Node 10: {28}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 9, 22}
- Node 12: {20, 23}
- Node 13: {9, 23, 24, 25}
- Node 14: {19, 27}
- Node 15: {3, 6}
- Node 16: {7, 8, 18}
- Node 17: {23, 24, 27}
- Node 18: {4, 16, 27}
- Node 19: {14, 21, 24}
- Node 20: {12, 27}
- Node 21: {4, 6, 19}
- Node 22: {1, 7, 11, 25}
- Node 23: {12, 13, 17, 24, 26}
- Node 24: {3, 13, 17, 19, 23}
- Node 25: {5, 13, 22}
- Node 26: {23, 29}
- Node 27: {4, 14, 17, 18, 20}
- Node 28: {5, 10}
- Node 29: {9, 26}

Now, let's identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 11: 4 neighbors
- Node 13: 4 neighbors
- Node 21: 3 neighbors
- Node 22: 4 neighbors
- Node 23: 5 neighbors
- Node 24: 5 neighbors
- Node 27: 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 22: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 24: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 27: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [64], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 2, 5>, <0, 1, 5, 6>, <0, 2, 3, 5>, <0, 2, 5, 6>, <0, 2, 5, 11>, 
<0, 3, 8, 24>, <0, 5, 6, 21>, <2, 3, 8, 15>, <2, 3, 8, 24>, <2, 5, 11, 22>, 
<3, 8, 15, 24>, <5, 6, 11, 25>, <5, 11, 22, 25>, <5, 13, 22, 25>, <13, 22, 23, 24>, 
<13, 22, 25, 25>, <13, 23, 24, 26>, <13, 23, 24, 27>, <13, 24, 25, 26>, <13, 24, 25, 27>, 
<13, 24, 25, 13>, <13, 24, 27, 17>, <22, 25, 4, 21>, <22, 25, 7, 16>, <24, 3, 17, 13>, 
<24, 3, 19, 23>, <24, 13, 23, 24>, <24, 13, 25, 25>, <24, 13, 26, 27>, <24, 13, 27, 14>
