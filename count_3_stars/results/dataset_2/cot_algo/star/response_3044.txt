Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 19) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 7) (5, 18) (5, 12) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (10, 3) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 15) (14, 7) (14, 19) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 19) (7, 18) (7, 14) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 2, 6, 4, 15
- Node 1: 3, 13, 9, 18
- Node 2: 18, 15, 0
- Node 3: 1, 0, 10, 8
- Node 4: 8, 0, 15
- Node 5: 18, 12
- Node 6: 11, 17, 0
- Node 7: 18, 14
- Node 8: 4, 3, 9
- Node 9: 1, 8
- Node 10: 3
- Node 11: 16, 6, 17
- Node 12: 5, 17, 19
- Node 13: 1, 17, 19
- Node 14: 7, 19
- Node 15: 2, 4, 0
- Node 16: 11, 19
- Node 17: 11, 6, 13, 12
- Node 18: 1, 2, 5, 7
- Node 19: 16, 13, 14, 12

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 4 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 4 neighbors

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

List of unique 3-stars found:
<0, 2, 15>, <0, 4, 15>, <0, 2, 4>, <0, 2, 6>, <0, 2, 18>, <0, 4, 6>, <0, 4, 18>, <0, 6, 18>, <1, 3, 9>, <1, 3, 13>, <1, 3, 18>, <1, 9, 13>, <3, 8, 9>, <3, 8, 10>, <3, 1, 18>, <3, 1, 13>, <4, 8, 15>, <6, 11, 17>, <12, 17, 19>, <13, 17, 19>, <16, 19, 13>, <17, 13, 19>, <18, 5, 7>, <18, 5, 12>, <18, 7, 14>, <18, 7, 19>
