Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, 8, 3
- Node 1: 5, 9, 7, 2
- Node 2: 5, 4, 6, 8, 1
- Node 3: 9, 6, 8, 0
- Node 4: 9, 2, 6, 0
- Node 5: 9, 6, 2, 8, 1
- Node 6: 5, 4, 7, 3, 2
- Node 7: 6, 1
- Node 8: 5, 2, 0, 3
- Node 9: 5, 4, 3, 1

Next, let's identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

Finally, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars (with nodes 5, 9, 7 and 2)
- Node 2 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars (with nodes 5, 4, 6; 5, 8, 2; 4, 6, 2; 4, 8, 2; 6, 8, 2; 5, 6, 2; 5, 8, 1; 4, 6, 1; 4, 8, 1; 6, 8, 1)
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars (with nodes 9, 6, 8 and 0)
- Node 4 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars (with nodes 9, 2, 6 and 0)
- Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars (with nodes 9, 6, 2; 9, 8, 5; 6, 8, 5; 2, 8, 5; 4, 6, 5; 4, 2, 5; 6, 2, 5; 6, 8, 1; 2, 8, 1; 4, 6, 1)
- Node 6 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars (with nodes 5, 4, 6; 5, 7, 6; 4, 7, 6; 3, 8, 6; 0, 8, 6; 2, 8, 6; 4, 3, 6; 4, 0, 6; 2, 3, 6; 2, 0, 6)
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars (with nodes 5, 3, 8 and 0)
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars (with nodes 1, 4, 9 and 3)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50
Therefore, the final answer is [50] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, 4, 6>, <5, 8, 2>, <4, 6, 2>, <4, 8, 2>, <6, 8, 2>, <5, 6, 2>, <5, 8, 1>, <4, 6, 1>, <4, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 1>, <9, 6, 2>, <9, 8, 5>, <6, 8, 5>, <2, 8, 5>, <4, 6, 5>, <4, 2, 5>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 8, 1>, <2, 8, 1>, <4, 6, 1>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 7, 6>, <4, 7, 6>, <3, 8, 6>, <0, 8, 6>, <2, 8, 6>, <4, 3, 6>, <4, 0, 6>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 0, 6>, <5, 3, 8>, <5, 9, 7>, <6, 4, 7>, <6, 3, 8>, <6, 0, 8>, <6, 2, 8>, <6, 4, 3>, <6, 4, 0>, <6, 2, 3>, <6, 2, 0>, <1, 4, 9>, <9, 3, 1>
