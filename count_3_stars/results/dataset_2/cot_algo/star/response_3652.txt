Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 19) (6, 5) (6, 10) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 12) (16, 7) (16, 1) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 8) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (12, 13) (12, 16) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 14) (2, 19) (4, 3) (4, 9) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's first create the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 10, 18}
- Node 1: {0, 8, 16}
- Node 2: {13, 14, 17, 19}
- Node 3: {4, 10, 15}
- Node 4: {3, 9}
- Node 5: {6, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {5, 10}
- Node 7: {8, 10, 16, 17}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 19}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 6, 7, 18}
- Node 11: {5, 14}
- Node 12: {13, 16}
- Node 13: {2, 12, 15, 18}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 15: {3, 13, 19}
- Node 16: {1, 7, 12}
- Node 17: {2, 7}
- Node 18: {0, 10, 13}
- Node 19: {2, 9, 15}

Now, we check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 0, 1, 7, 10: not applicable as they have less than 3 neighbors

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, therefore the final answer is [12].

List of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <2, (13, 14, 19)>
- <2, (13, 14, 2)>
- <2, (13, 14, 5)>
- <2, (13, 14, 8)>
- <13, (2, 14, 18)>
- <13, (2, 14, 5)>
- <13, (2, 14, 8)>
- <13, (14, 5, 8)>
- <14, (2, 5, 8)>
- <14, (2, 11, 5)>
- <14, (2, 8, 11)>
- <14, (5, 11, 8)>
