Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 8, 13}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 12, 13}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 9, 14}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 10, 14}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 7, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 5: Neighbors {2, 7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {8, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 5, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 6}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 6, 7, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 9, 13}
- Node 11: Neighbors {4, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 12: Neighbors {1, 4, 5, 11}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 1, 7, 10}
- Node 14: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars at Node 2: <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 14)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 14)>, <2, (1, 9, 14)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 14)>, <2, (4, 9, 14)>, <2, (5, 9, 14)>
- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars at Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 12)>, <4, (2, 7, 12)>, <4, (5, 7, 12)>, <4, (2, 5, 11)>, <4, (2, 7, 11)>, <4, (2, 11, 12)>, <4, (5, 7, 11)>, <4, (5, 11, 12)>, <4, (7, 11, 12)>
- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars at Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 12)>, <5, (2, 7, 12)>, <5, (4, 7, 12)>, <5, (2, 4, 11)>, <5, (2, 7, 11)>, <5, (2, 11, 12)>, <5, (4, 7, 11)>, <5, (4, 11, 12)>, <5, (7, 11, 12)>
- inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars at Node 6: <6, (8, 9, 10)>, <6, (8, 9, 14)>, <6, (9, 10, 14)>, <6, (8, 10, 14)>
- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars at Node 7: <7, (4, 11, 12)>, <7, (4, 11, 13)>, <7, (4, 12, 13)>, <7, (11, 12, 13)>, <7, (5, 11, 12)>, <7, (5, 11, 13)>, <7, (5, 12, 13)>, <7, (11, 12, 13)>, <7, (5, 12, 11)>, <7, (14, 5, 11)>
- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars at Node 12: <12, (1, 4, 5)>, <12, (1, 4, 11)>, <12, (1, 5, 11)>, <12, (4, 5, 11)>, <12, (1, 4, 12)>, <12, (1, 5, 12)>, <12, (1, 11, 12)>, <12, (4, 5, 12)>, <12, (4, 11, 12)>, <12, (5, 11, 12)>
- inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars at Node 13: <13, (1, 10, 7)>, <13, (1, 10, 0)>, <13, (1, 10, 13)>, <13, (1, 7, 0)>, <13, (1, 7, 13)>, <13, (1, 0, 13)>, <13, (10, 7, 0)>, <13, (10, 7, 13)>, <13, (10, 0, 13)>, <13, (7, 0, 13)>

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [64].
