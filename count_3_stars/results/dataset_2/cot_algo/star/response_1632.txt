Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor set for each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4, 5, 6}
- Node 1: {2, 5, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 4, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, we'll find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 19 \), so the final answer is [19].
