Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (1, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 7, 10, 11}
- Node 1: {13}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 5, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 6, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 10, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 4, 11}
- Node 10: {0, 3, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 10}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 5, 6, 8}

Now, we can identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star and list the unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 10)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 9)> and <2, (5, 6, 14)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 5, 10)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 5, 14)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 8, 12)>
- Node 8: <8, (3, 7, 14)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 11)>
- Node 10: <10, (0, 3, 13)>
- Node 11: <11, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 12: <12, (7, 8, 10)>
- Node 13: <13, (1, 5, 10)>
- Node 14: <14, (2, 5, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [14]
