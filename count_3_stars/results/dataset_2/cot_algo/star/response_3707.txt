Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 7, 8, 11}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {7, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {9, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {3, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 4, 14}
- Node 8: {0, 3}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 6, 9, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {4, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11}

Next, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <7, (0, 4, 14)>, <7, (2, 4, 14)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <9, (4, 10, 14)>, <9, (5, 10, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors: <12, (4, 13, 14)> 

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 5, so the final answer is [5].
