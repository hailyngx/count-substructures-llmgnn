Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {6, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 3, 2}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 3: {9, 1, 7, 0, 4, 2}
- Node 4: {6, 3, 7, 0}
- Node 5: {6, 1}
- Node 6: {5, 4, 8, 0}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 0, 8}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 7, 2}
- Node 9: {8, 1, 3, 2}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed by the nodes:
- Node 3 forms 4 unique 3-stars: <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 0 forms 1 unique 3-star: <0, (6, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
