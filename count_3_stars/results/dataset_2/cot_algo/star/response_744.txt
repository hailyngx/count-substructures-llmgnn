Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (18, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 15) (3, 9) (3, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 17) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {8, 14}
- Node 1: {6, 10, 11, 14, 16}
- Node 2: {8, 9, 12, 16}
- Node 3: {9, 18}
- Node 4: {7}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 10, 13, 17}
- Node 7: {4, 12, 17}
- Node 8: {0, 2}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 5, 9, 11, 17}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 19}
- Node 11: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 7, 15}
- Node 13: {6, 11, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 1}
- Node 15: {12, 17, 19}
- Node 16: {1, 2}
- Node 17: {6, 7, 9, 15, 19}
- Node 18: {3}
- Node 19: {10, 13, 15, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 15 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 60

So, there are 60 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (6, 10, 14)>
<1, (6, 10, 16)>
<1, (6, 11, 16)>
<1, (10, 14, 16)>
<1, (11, 14, 16)>
<2, (8, 12, 16)>
<2, (8, 12, 9)>
<2, (8, 16, 9)>
<2, (12, 16, 9)>
<6, (10, 13, 17)>
<6, (10, 17, 19)>
<6, (13, 17, 19)>
<9, (11, 13, 17)>
<9, (11, 13, 19)>
<9, (11, 17, 19)>
<9, (13, 17, 19)>
<15, (17, 19, 15)>
<9, (11, 17, 6)>
<9, (11, 17, 9)>
<9, (11, 19, 17)>
<9, (13, 17, 6)>
<9, (13, 17, 19)>
<12, (2, 7, 15)>
<17, (6, 7, 15)>

So, the final answer is [60].
