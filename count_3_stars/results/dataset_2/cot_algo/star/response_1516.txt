Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The neighbors for each node are as follows:

Node 0: {5, 3, 4, 7}
Node 1: {6, 3, 4}
Node 2: {5}
Node 3: {6, 1, 0, 4}
Node 4: {9, 1, 3, 7, 0}
Node 5: {6, 2, 8, 0, 7}
Node 6: {5, 1, 7, 3, 8}
Node 7: {5, 9, 6, 4, 0, 8}
Node 8: {5, 9, 6, 7}
Node 9: {8, 4, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [59].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
