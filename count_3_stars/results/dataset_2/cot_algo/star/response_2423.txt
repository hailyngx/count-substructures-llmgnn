This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 25) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 12) (0, 2) (27, 14) (7, 21) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 22) (21, 2) (10, 11) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 29) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 24) (23, 9) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 17) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 23) (6, 5) (28, 29) (28, 26) (29, 0) (29, 8) (29, 28) (29, 19) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 4) (2, 0) (2, 21) (2, 22) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 20) (22, 25) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 29) (19, 22) (19, 18) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 18) (9, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 24) (1, 20) (1, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 1) (14, 27) (14, 5) (14, 13) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (16, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) (24, 23) (24, 17) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 26) (4, 16) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to each node. Then we will check if any node has exactly three neighbors to form a 3-star.

Here are the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: (4, 29, 12, 2)
- Node 1: (20, 25)
- Node 2: (0, 21, 22)
- Node 3: (15, 17, 4)
- Node 4: (3, 0, 26, 16)
- Node 5: (8, 6, 16, 14)
- Node 6: (15, 11, 23, 5)
- Node 7: (21, 9)
- Node 8: (5, 29)
- Node 9: (7, 23, 18, 13)
- Node 10: (11, 18)
- Node 11: (10, 6, 23)
- Node 12: (0, 20, 17)
- Node 13: (14, 9)
- Node 14: (27, 5, 13)
- Node 15: (3, 6, 25)
- Node 16: (5, 4, 26)
- Node 17: (3, 12, 24)
- Node 18: (10, 19, 9)
- Node 19: (29, 22, 18)
- Node 20: (12, 22, 1)
- Node 21: (7, 22, 2)
- Node 22: (21, 2, 19, 20, 25)
- Node 23: (11, 6, 24, 9)
- Node 24: (23, 17)
- Node 25: (15, 22, 1)
- Node 26: (28, 4, 16)
- Node 27: (14)
- Node 28: (29, 26)
- Node 29: (0, 28, 19, 8)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors
- Node 7: has 2 neighbors
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors
- Node 10: has 2 neighbors
- Node 13: has 2 neighbors
- Node 24: has 2 neighbors
- Node 27: has 1 neighbor

Therefore, we need to check the other nodes for possible 3-stars:
- From the above list, only Node 22 has exactly three neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars involving Node 22.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found:
<22, (2, 20, 25)>
