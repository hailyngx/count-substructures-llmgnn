Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 13) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {13, 14, 7}
- Node 1: {4, 5, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 2: {7, 10}
- Node 3: {7, 8, 13}
- Node 4: {1, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 13}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 12: {5, 7, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 1, 3, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 14: {0, 9, 10}

Next, we will check which nodes have at least 3 neighbors to form a 3-star:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 93 \), therefore, the final answer is [93].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 11, 13)>, <3, (7, 8, 13)>, <5, (6, 9, 12)>, <6, (5, 9, 10)>, <7, (0, 11, 12)>, <9, (5, 10, 12)>, <10, (6, 11, 12)>, <13, (0, 8, 11)>
