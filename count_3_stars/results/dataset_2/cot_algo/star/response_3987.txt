Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (16, 3) (16, 18) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 13) (9, 0) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 7) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 13) (8, 17) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 2, 19, 9, 13
Node 1: 15, 17, 6, 7, 9
Node 2: 6, 0
Node 3: 16
Node 4: 12, 9, 14, 6
Node 5: 15, 14
Node 6: 1, 10, 4, 2, 11
Node 7: 17, 1, 13, 18
Node 8: 17
Node 9: 1, 4, 19, 13, 0
Node 10: 15, 6
Node 11: 6, 14
Node 12: 4
Node 13: 9, 7, 0
Node 14: 4, 11, 5
Node 15: 1, 10, 18, 5
Node 16: 3, 18
Node 17: 1, 19, 8, 7
Node 18: 15, 16, 7
Node 19: 17, 0, 9

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with them:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 7, 9, 15, 17

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 13, 19)>
<1, (7, 9, 17)>
<1, (9, 15, 18)>
<1, (7, 13, 17)>
<1, (6, 10, 15)>
<6, (2, 4, 11)>
<6, (1, 10, 15)>
<6, (4, 10, 14)>
<6, (4, 11, 14)>
<6, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 9, 17)>
<9, (0, 13, 19)>
<9, (1, 7, 17)>
<15, (5, 14, 18)>
<17, (7, 15, 18)>
