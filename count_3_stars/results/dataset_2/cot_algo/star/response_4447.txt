Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 28) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 1) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 5) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 27) (4, 20) (4, 15) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 23) (25, 6) (25, 23) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 10) (9, 3) (9, 28) (9, 24) (29, 27) (29, 23) (10, 28) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 22) (21, 10) (21, 15) (21, 17) (5, 26) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (23, 26) (23, 27) (23, 25) (23, 29) (19, 14) (22, 7) (22, 10) (22, 17) (6, 11) (6, 25) (6, 17) (17, 21) (17, 22) (17, 6) (17, 15) (8, 0) (8, 10) (8, 5) (20, 4) (20, 13) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 20) (13, 24) (24, 9) (24, 13) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 21) (15, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {8, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 18, 26}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 14, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 9, 13, 26}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 15, 20, 27}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 8, 12, 14, 26}
- Node 6: Neighbors {11, 17, 25}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 12, 22}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 24, 28}
- Node 10: Neighbors {8, 21, 22, 28}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 15}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 13, 5}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 12, 20, 24}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 2, 5, 19}
- Node 15: Neighbors {4, 11, 17, 21}
- Node 16: Neighbors {28}
- Node 17: Neighbors {6, 15, 21, 22}
- Node 18: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 19: Neighbors {14}
- Node 20: Neighbors {4, 13}
- Node 21: Neighbors {10, 15, 17}
- Node 22: Neighbors {7, 10, 17}
- Node 23: Neighbors {26, 27, 25, 29}
- Node 24: Neighbors {9, 13}
- Node 25: Neighbors {6, 23}
- Node 26: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 23}
- Node 27: Neighbors {4, 23, 29}
- Node 28: Neighbors {9, 10, 16}
- Node 29: Neighbors {27, 23}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: Node 17, Node 28
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{17}{3} + \binom{28}{3} = 680 + 3276 = 3956 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3956], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <4, 15, 21>
- <5, 7, 12>
- <10, 17, 21>
- <10, 22, 17>
- <10, 22, 7>
- <13, 20, 24>
- <15, 17, 21>
