Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 21) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (22, 9) (22, 10) (24, 7) (24, 13) (26, 6) (26, 0) (26, 12) (4, 9) (4, 28) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 8) (16, 28) (16, 19) (28, 4) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 19) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 21) (10, 22) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 19) (0, 9) (0, 26) (0, 3) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 29) (18, 1) (18, 20) (18, 13) (6, 26) (6, 15) (29, 14) (29, 11) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 24) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 12) (2, 27) (2, 15) (2, 3) (2, 21) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 7) (20, 27) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 8) (25, 21) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 25) (5, 15) (5, 20) 

Response:
The given graph consists of 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

After analyzing the graph, we find the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 9, 26}
- Node 1: {11, 12, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {3, 15, 21, 27}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 7, 28}
- Node 4: {9, 28}
- Node 5: {15, 20}
- Node 6: {15, 26}
- Node 7: {3, 7, 19, 24}
- Node 8: {9, 21, 25, 27}
- Node 9: {0, 4, 8, 22}
- Node 10: {12, 13, 15, 22}
- Node 11: {1, 21, 29}
- Node 12: {1, 10, 13, 26}
- Node 13: {10, 12, 18, 24}
- Node 14: {17, 29}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 10, 6}
- Node 16: {19, 28}
- Node 17: {1, 14, 21}
- Node 18: {1, 13, 20}
- Node 19: {16, 7, 28}
- Node 20: {5, 18, 27}
- Node 21: {1, 8, 11, 15, 25}
- Node 22: {9, 10}
- Node 24: {7, 13}
- Node 25: {8, 21}
- Node 26: {0, 6, 12}
- Node 27: {2, 8, 20}
- Node 28: {3, 4, 16, 19}
- Node 29: {11, 14}

Now we will examine the neighbor sets to see if any nodes form 3-stars:

Node 1, 17, and 21 each have exactly 3 neighbors, so we have:
- <1, (11, 12, 18)>
- <17, (14, 1, 21)>
- <21, (8, 11, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
