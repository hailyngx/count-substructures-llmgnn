Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 17) (16, 28) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (0, 21) (0, 19) (27, 11) (27, 19) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 13) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (1, 20) (26, 25) (26, 4) (2, 11) (2, 4) (28, 16) (28, 29) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 14) (22, 9) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 18) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 18) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 7) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 5) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 18) (18, 23) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 25) (12, 11) (12, 16) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 24) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 21) (24, 8) (24, 20) (24, 13) (24, 14) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 24) (4, 15) (4, 26) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the provided edges:

Node 0: 21, 19
Node 1: 20
Node 2: 11, 4
Node 3: 15, 17, 6, 29
Node 4: 15, 26, 2
Node 5: 15, 29, 21
Node 6: 3, 14
Node 7: 20, 9, 10, 25, 14
Node 8: 23, 24, 10
Node 9: 22, 18, 7
Node 10: 8, 21, 7
Node 11: 27, 12, 2, 17
Node 12: 11, 16
Node 13: 15, 23, 24
Node 14: 29, 6, 7, 24
Node 15: 3, 13, 5, 4
Node 16: 28, 12
Node 17: 11, 3, 20, 18
Node 18: 23, 9, 17, 19, 25
Node 19: 0, 27, 18
Node 20: 17, 1, 7, 24
Node 21: 0, 10, 5
Node 22: 9
Node 23: 8, 18, 13
Node 24: 8, 20, 13, 14
Node 25: 26, 7, 18
Node 26: 25, 4
Node 27: 11, 19
Node 28: 16, 29
Node 29: 3, 28, 5, 14

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:
Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 17, 18, 24, 29
Total number of 3-stars = \( C(3, 3) + C(5, 3) + C(4, 3) + C(5, 3) + C(4, 3) + C(4, 3) \)
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [33].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (6, 14, 29)>, <7, (20, 24, 14)>, <17, (20, 18, 1)>, <18, (23, 25, 19)>, <24, (8, 13, 20)>, <29, (28, 5, 14)>
