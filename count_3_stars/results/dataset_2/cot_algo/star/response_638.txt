Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 10) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 2, 3, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {0, 5}
- Node 4: {2, 6, 10, 11}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {9, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {8, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 12: {7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 8, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 5, 9, 12}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 70 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [70].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 13, 14>
- <0, 2, 10, 11>
- <1, 11, 12, 14>
- <4, 6, 10, 11>
- <5, 6, 7, 14>
- <7, 8, 9, 12>
