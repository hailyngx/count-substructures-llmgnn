Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 17) (8, 14) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 18) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 16) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 9) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (9, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 18) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 19. 

Based on the given edges, the neighboring nodes for each node are calculated as follows:

- Node 0: {4, 10, 18}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {3, 16, 17}
- Node 3: {2, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 12, 17}
- Node 5: {6, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 18}
- Node 7: {1, 11, 12, 19}
- Node 8: {3, 14}
- Node 9: {10}
- Node 10: {0, 9, 19}
- Node 11: {5, 7, 17, 18}
- Node 12: {4, 7, 16}
- Node 13: {1, 15, 16}
- Node 14: {1, 8, 18}
- Node 15: {13}
- Node 16: {2, 12, 13, 19}
- Node 17: {2, 4, 11, 18}
- Node 18: {0, 6, 11, 14, 17}
- Node 19: {7, 10, 16}

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 10, and 13 only form one 3-star each.
- For the rest of the nodes with 4 or more neighbors:
  - Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 7 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 11 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 12 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 14 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  - Node 16 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 17 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 18 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  - Node 19 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding them all up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \([1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [34]\).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 10, 18>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 13>
- <1, 7, 12>
- <1, 7, 14>
- <4, 7, 12>
- <4, 12, 16>
- <7, 12, 16>
- <11, 17, 18>
- <11, 17, 18>
- <11, 17, 18>
- <11, 17, 18>
- <14, 17, 18>
- <16, 17, 18>
- <16, 17, 18>
- <16, 17, 18>
- <16, 17, 18>
- <16, 17, 18>
- <16, 17, 18>
- <16, 17, 18>
