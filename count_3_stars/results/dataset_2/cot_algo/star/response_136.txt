Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 3, 10
- Node 1: 11, 16
- Node 2: 17
- Node 3: 0, 17
- Node 4: 5, 19, 24
- Node 5: 4, 6, 20
- Node 6: 5, 10, 17, 21
- Node 7: 28, 29
- Node 8: 15, 17, 18, 21, 26
- Node 9: 12, 14, 29
- Node 10: 0, 6, 8, 11, 13
- Node 11: 1, 10, 22, 23, 28
- Node 12: 9, 14
- Node 13: 10, 14, 19, 25, 27
- Node 14: 9, 12, 13
- Node 15: 8, 26
- Node 16: 1
- Node 17: 2, 3, 6, 8, 24
- Node 18: 8, 20, 23
- Node 19: 4, 13, 22
- Node 20: 5, 18, 23, 25
- Node 21: 6, 8
- Node 22: 19, 25, 28
- Node 23: 11, 18, 20, 25, 26
- Node 24: 4, 17, 27
- Node 25: 13, 20, 22, 23
- Node 26: 8, 15, 23
- Node 27: 13, 24
- Node 28: 7, 11, 22
- Node 29: 7, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 3: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: <6, (5, 10, 21)>
- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: <8, (6, 10, 21)>, <8, (17, 18, 26)>, <8, (15, 17, 26)>
- Node 9: <9, (12, 14, 29)>
- Node 10: <10, (6, 8, 21)>, <10, (11, 13, 25)>
- Node 11: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 13: <13, (10, 14, 25)>, <13, (19, 22, 27)>
- Node 14: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 15: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 16: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 17: <17, (6, 8, 21)>, <17, (3, 8, 24)>
- Node 18: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 19: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 20: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 21: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 22: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 23: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 24: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 25: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 26: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 27: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 28: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 29: Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
