Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 5
Node 1: 2, 3, 10, 16
Node 2: 1, 6, 9, 10, 19
Node 3: 1, 7, 16
Node 4: 5, 16
Node 5: 0, 4, 13, 17
Node 6: 2, 7, 18
Node 7: 3, 6, 12, 19
Node 8: 9, 13
Node 9: 2, 8, 14, 17
Node 10: 1, 2, 11, 15
Node 11: 10, 13, 19
Node 12: 7, 16
Node 13: 5, 8, 11, 15
Node 14: 9
Node 15: 10, 13
Node 16: 1, 3, 4, 12
Node 17: 5, 9
Node 18: 6, 19
Node 19: 2, 6, 7, 11, 18

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1 (neighbors 2, 3, 10, 16)
- Node 2 (neighbors 1, 6, 9, 10, 19)
- Node 3 (neighbors 1, 7, 16)
- Node 5 (neighbors 0, 4, 13, 17)
- Node 7 (neighbors 3, 6, 12, 19)
- Node 9 (neighbors 2, 8, 14, 17)
- Node 10 (neighbors 1, 2, 11, 15)
- Node 11 (neighbors 10, 13, 19)
- Node 13 (neighbors 5, 8, 11, 15)
- Node 16 (neighbors 1, 3, 4, 12)
- Node 19 (neighbors 2, 6, 7, 11, 18)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

Total number of 3-stars = [5]

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 3, 16)>
<2, (1, 10, 19)>
<7, (3, 6, 12)>
<10, (1, 11, 15)>
<16, (3, 4, 12)>
