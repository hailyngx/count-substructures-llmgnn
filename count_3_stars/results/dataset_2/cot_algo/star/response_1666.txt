Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 4, 8, 6
- Node 1: 10, 4, 13, 7
- Node 2: 6, 3, 14, 7
- Node 3: 5, 2, 13
- Node 4: 5, 8, 0, 14, 1
- Node 5: 9, 11, 4, 3, 10
- Node 6: 7, 2, 0, 13
- Node 7: 11, 1, 6, 2, 14, 13
- Node 8: 11, 4, 0, 12
- Node 9: 5, 14
- Node 10: 5, 11, 12, 1
- Node 11: 5, 10, 7, 8
- Node 12: 10, 8, 14
- Node 13: 1, 6, 7, 3
- Node 14: 9, 4, 2, 12, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 54

So, the final answer is [54], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (9, 11, 4)>, <5, (9, 11, 3)>, <5, (9, 11, 10)>, <5, (9, 4, 10)>, <5, (11, 4, 10)>, <5, (9, 3, 10)>, <5, (11, 3, 10)>, <5, (4, 3, 10)>, <1, (10, 4, 13)>, <1, (10, 4, 7)>, <1, (10, 13, 7)>, <1, (4, 13, 7)>, <7, (11, 6, 13)>, <7, (1, 6, 13)>, <7, (1, 6, 3)>, <7, (6, 13, 3)>, <7, (6, 13, 14)>, <7, (13, 3, 14)>, <7, (13, 6, 14)>, <4, (8, 0, 14)>, <4, (8, 0, 1)>, <4, (8, 0, 13)>, <4, (8, 14, 1)>, <4, (8, 14, 13)>, <4, (0, 1, 13)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 13, 7)>, <4, (1, 13, 7)>, <4, (14, 1, 13)>, <14, (9, 2, 12)>, <14, (9, 2, 7)>, <14, (9, 2, 13)>, <14, (9, 12, 7)>, <14, (9, 12, 13)>, <14, (2, 7, 13)>, <14, (2, 7, 12)>, <14, (2, 13, 12)>, <14, (7, 13, 12)>.
