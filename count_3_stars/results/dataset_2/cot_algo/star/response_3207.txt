Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 18) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 18) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 19) (6, 14) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 15) (19, 7) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 12) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {8, 16, 13, 12}
- Node 1: {10, 14, 16}
- Node 2: {11, 13, 15}
- Node 3: {10, 17, 7, 18}
- Node 5: {9, 10}
- Node 6: {14, 15}
- Node 7: {9, 14, 3, 19}
- Node 8: {9, 15, 0}
- Node 9: {8, 7, 5}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 13, 5}
- Node 11: {2, 16, 18}
- Node 12: {0, 18}
- Node 13: {10, 0, 2}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 6, 17}
- Node 15: {8, 16, 6, 2}
- Node 16: {15, 1, 0, 11}
- Node 17: {18, 14, 3}
- Node 18: {11, 17, 3, 12}
- Node 19: {7}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 10, 15

For each of these nodes, we can calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 3: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 10: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- Node 15: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Total 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 8, 12>
- <3, 7, 17>
- <7, 9, 14>
- <10, 1, 3>
- <15, 2, 16>
