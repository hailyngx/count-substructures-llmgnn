Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (13, 0) (22, 12) (11, 19) (11, 29) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 8) (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 27) (26, 4) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 29) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 28) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 8) (12, 22) (12, 10) (12, 17) (27, 9) (27, 26) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 23) (3, 14) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 24) (19, 1) (4, 26) (4, 2) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 24) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (5, 28) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 15) (29, 11) (29, 7) (29, 23) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 1) (23, 14) (23, 29) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: 13, 7, 14
- Node 1: 20, 19, 2, 28, 10
- Node 2: 9, 4, 1
- Node 3: 14
- Node 4: 26, 2
- Node 5: 28
- Node 6: 20, 28, 17
- Node 7: 21, 0, 29
- Node 8: 16, 25, 17
- Node 9: 26, 2, 10, 27
- Node 10: 13, 9, 12, 1
- Node 11: 19, 29
- Node 12: 22, 10, 17
- Node 13: 10, 0
- Node 14: 0, 3, 23
- Node 15: 26, 19, 24
- Node 16: 21, 24, 8
- Node 17: 20, 12, 6, 8
- Node 18: 19, 24
- Node 19: 11, 18, 15, 24, 1
- Node 20: 25, 17, 1, 6
- Node 21: 16, 7, 28
- Node 22: 12
- Node 23: 14, 29
- Node 24: 16, 18, 19, 15
- Node 25: 20, 8
- Node 26: 9, 15, 27, 4
- Node 27: 9, 26
- Node 28: 6, 21, 1, 5
- Node 29: 11, 7, 23

Based on the above neighbor sets, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 19, 28

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- For Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 19: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 28: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 25

Therefore, the final answer is [25].
