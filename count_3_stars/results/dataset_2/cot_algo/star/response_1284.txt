Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {8, 7, 3, 11, 4}
- Node 1: {5, 13, 11, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 13, 7, 11, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 14}
- Node 4: {12, 0, 10, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 2, 1, 10}
- Node 6: {5, 10, 12, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {9, 6, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 14, 7}
- Node 10: {5, 6, 4, 14, 2}
- Node 11: {13, 0, 14, 1, 2}
- Node 12: {6, 4}
- Node 13: {2, 11, 1}
- Node 14: {9, 11, 3, 1, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
- Node 10 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-star.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62

Unique 3-stars found:
