Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 22) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 19) (27, 6) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 11) (7, 14) (7, 25) (7, 9) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 23) (20, 14) (20, 25) (20, 0) (25, 17) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 2) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 22) (2, 25) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 28) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 3) (28, 17) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 13) (28, 5) (5, 28) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 10) (9, 7) (9, 8) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 13) (16, 4) (1, 29) (1, 18) (29, 1) (29, 18) (23, 21) (23, 5) (3, 26) (3, 5) (3, 12) (24, 27) (24, 22) (6, 27) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 22) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 24) (22, 12) (11, 17) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 29) (18, 11) (19, 27) 

Response:
From the given information, we can construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {21, 20, 18}
Node 1: {29, 18}
Node 2: {25, 4, 8, 28}
Node 3: {26, 5, 12}
Node 4: {14, 16, 2}
Node 5: {28, 23, 12, 3}
Node 6: {27}
Node 7: {14, 25, 9}
Node 8: {2, 9, 26, 22}
Node 9: {7, 8}
Node 10: {15, 27, 13}
Node 11: {17, 18}
Node 12: {5, 3, 22}
Node 13: {21, 28, 10}
Node 14: {17, 20, 4}
Node 15: {10, 26, 22}
Node 16: {4}
Node 17: {14, 25, 28, 11}
Node 18: {0, 1, 29, 11}
Node 19: {27}
Node 20: {14, 25, 0}
Node 21: {13, 0, 23}
Node 22: {15, 8, 24, 12}
Node 23: {21, 5}
Node 24: {27, 22}
Node 25: {17, 7, 20, 2}
Node 26: {15, 8, 28, 3}
Node 27: {24, 10, 19, 6}
Node 28: {17, 2, 26, 5, 13}
Node 29: {1, 18}

Now, we will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 2, 5, 8, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 25, 26, and 28 have 4 or more neighbors. Applying \( \binom{n}{3} \) to these nodes gives a total of 196 3-stars.
- Node 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 16, 19, 23, 24, 27, and 29 have 3 neighbors, forming a total of 15 additional 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 196 + 15 = 211, which can be represented as [211].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (4, 8, 28)>, <5, (3, 12, 28)>, <8, (2, 26, 28)>, <13, (10, 21, 28)>, <14, (4, 17, 25)>, <15, (10, 22, 26)>, <17, (11, 25, 28)>, <18, (1, 11, 29)>, <20, (14, 25, 0)>, <21, (0, 13, 23)>, <22, (12, 15, 24)>, <25, (7, 17, 20)>, <26, (3, 8, 28)>
