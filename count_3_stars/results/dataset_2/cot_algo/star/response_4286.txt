Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: {4, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 3: {2, 6, 10}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 11}
- Node 5: {4, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {4, 9, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 7, 8, 13}
- Node 10: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 6, 12, 13}
- Node 12: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {6, 8, 9, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 12, 13}

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 13: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 69, so the final answer is [69].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 11)>
<0, (4, 11, 14)>
<0, (7, 9, 1)>
<0, (11, 6, 13)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 13)>
<2, (4, 6, 11)>
<2, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (6, 11, 13)>
<4, (0, 11, 6)>
<4, (2, 9, 6)>
<4, (5, 11, 6)>
<4, (8, 11, 13)>
<6, (2, 13, 11)>
<7, (0, 4, 11)>
<7, (1, 9, 7)>
<8, (4, 10, 8)>
<8, (9, 13, 8)>
<9, (1, 7, 9)>
<10, (3, 8, 10)>
<11, (0, 4, 6)>
<11, (6, 13, 11)>
<13, (6, 11, 13)>
