Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 8) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10. Let's find the 3-stars formed by these nodes:

For node 1:
Node 1 has neighbors 6, 10, 11, and 8. Since it has 4 neighbors, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<1, (6, 10, 11)>, <1, (6, 10, 8)>, <1, (6, 11, 8)>, <1, (10, 11, 8)>

For node 2:
Node 2 has neighbors 3, 4, 13, and 0. Since it has 4 neighbors, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<2, (3, 4, 13)>, <2, (3, 4, 0)>, <2, (3, 13, 0)>, <2, (4, 13, 0)>

For node 4:
Node 4 has neighbors 9, 12, 2, 13, 14, and 11. Since it has 6 neighbors, we can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
<4, (9, 12, 2)>, <4, (9, 12, 13)>, <4, (9, 12, 14)>, <4, (9, 12, 11)>, <4, (9, 2, 13)>, <4, (9, 2, 14)>, <4, (9, 2, 11)>, <4, (9, 13, 14)>, <4, (9, 13, 11)>, <4, (9, 14, 11)>, 
<4, (12, 2, 13)>, <4, (12, 2, 14)>, <4, (12, 2, 11)>, <4, (12, 13, 14)>, <4, (12, 13, 11)>, <4, (12, 14, 11)>, 
<4, (2, 13, 14)>, <4, (2, 13, 11)>, <4, (2, 14, 11)>, 
<4, (13, 14, 11)>

For node 7:
Node 7 has neighbors 3, 11, 14, and 13. Since it has 4 neighbors, we can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<7, (3, 11, 14)>, <7, (3, 11, 13)>, <7, (3, 14, 13)>, <7, (11, 14, 13)>

For node 10:
Node 10 has neighbors 9, 6, 1, 12, 13, and 8. Since it has 6 neighbors, we can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
<10, (9, 6, 1)>, <10, (9, 6, 12)>, <10, (9, 6, 13)>, <10, (9, 6, 8)>, <10, (9, 1, 12)>, <10, (9, 1, 13)>, <10, (9, 1, 8)>, <10, (9, 12, 13)>, <10, (9, 12, 8)>, <10, (9, 13, 8)>, 
<10, (6, 1, 12)>, <10, (6, 1, 13)>, <10, (6, 1, 8)>, <10, (6, 12, 13)>, <10, (6, 12, 8)>, <10, (6, 13, 8)>, 
<10, (1, 12, 13)>, <10, (1, 12, 8)>, <10, (1, 13, 8)>, 
<10, (12, 13, 8)>

Adding up all the unique 3-stars:
4 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 2) + 20 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 7) + 20 (from node 10) = 52

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [52].
