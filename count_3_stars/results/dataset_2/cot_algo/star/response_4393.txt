Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 7) (2, 9) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the neighbor sets for each node:

Node 0: {5}
Node 1: {3, 6, 7, 11, 17}
Node 2: {9}
Node 3: {1, 9, 14}
Node 4: {5, 7, 12}
Node 5: {0, 4, 7, 19}
Node 6: {1, 7, 11, 12}
Node 7: {1, 4, 5, 6, 18}
Node 8: {10, 12, 13, 14, 15}
Node 9: {2, 3}
Node 10: {8, 14}
Node 11: {1, 6, 11, 16, 19}
Node 12: {4, 6, 8}
Node 13: {8}
Node 14: {3, 8, 10}
Node 15: {8, 16}
Node 16: {11, 15, 18, 19}
Node 17: {1, 19}
Node 18: {7, 16}
Node 19: {5, 11, 16, 17}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 13, 15

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

Node 0: 0 3-star
Node 2: 0 3-star
Node 13: 0 3-star
Node 15: 0 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0].
