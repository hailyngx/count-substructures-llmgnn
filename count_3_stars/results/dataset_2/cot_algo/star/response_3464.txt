Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 1) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (2, 15) (2, 6) (18, 8) (18, 3) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbor of nodes 15, 11, 3. (Degree: 3)
- Node 1: Neighbor of nodes 13, 19, 12, 10. (Degree: 4)
- Node 2: Neighbor of nodes 15, 6. (Degree: 2)
- Node 3: Neighbor of nodes 0, 5, 18. (Degree: 3)
- Node 4: Neighbor of nodes 7, 13, 6, 17. (Degree: 4)
- Node 5: Neighbor of nodes 17, 11, 14, 3. (Degree: 4)
- Node 6: Neighbor of nodes 4, 2. (Degree: 2)
- Node 7: Neighbor of nodes 4, 9, 8. (Degree: 3)
- Node 8: Neighbor of nodes 7, 18. (Degree: 2)
- Node 9: Neighbor of nodes 7, 15, 16. (Degree: 3)
- Node 10: Neighbor of nodes 19, 14, 12, 1. (Degree: 4)
- Node 11: Neighbor of nodes 14, 0, 5. (Degree: 3)
- Node 12: Neighbor of nodes 10, 1. (Degree: 2)
- Node 13: Neighbor of nodes 4, 17, 1. (Degree: 3)
- Node 14: Neighbor of nodes 15, 11, 5, 10. (Degree: 4)
- Node 15: Neighbor of nodes 16, 0, 9, 14, 2. (Degree: 5)
- Node 16: Neighbor of nodes 15, 9. (Degree: 2)
- Node 17: Neighbor of nodes 4, 13, 5. (Degree: 3)
- Node 18: Neighbor of nodes 8, 3. (Degree: 2)
- Node 19: Neighbor of nodes 10, 1. (Degree: 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes that have 3 or more neighbors.

For this graph, the nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17.

Calculating \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4 
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- Node 15: \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 30

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in this graph is [30].

The unique 3-star configurations are:
<0, (15, 11, 3)>
<1, (13, 19, 12)>
<1, (13, 19, 10)>
<1, (13, 12, 10)>
<1, (19, 12, 10)>
<4, (7, 13, 6)>
<4, (7, 9, 8)>
<4, (13, 17, 5)>
<5, (17, 11, 14)>
<10, (19, 14, 12)>
<15, (16, 9, 14)>
