Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first determine the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6}
Node 4: {0, 1, 9}
Node 5: {2, 3, 8, 9}
Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 8}
Node 7: {2}
Node 8: {5, 6, 9}
Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 5, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-star graphs:

Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 8, Node 9

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 1: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 2: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 3: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \(  \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \(  \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 9: \(  \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 59

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [59], and the unique 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>
