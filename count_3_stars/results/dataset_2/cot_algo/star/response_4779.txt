Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 9) (17, 15) (2, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 9) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 19) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 15) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 19) (19, 16) (19, 15) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 18) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 5) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
This graph represents a network with 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will follow the steps mentioned earlier.

First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

1: {0, 10}
2: {6}
3: {8}
4: {10, 11}
5: {0, 6, 12, 14, 18}
6: {0, 2, 14}
7: {9, 11, 15}
8: {3, 12, 13, 18}
9: {7, 13, 17}
10: {0, 1, 4, 11}
11: {4, 7, 10, 14}
12: {5, 8, 15, 16}
13: {8, 9, 15}
14: {5, 6, 11}
15: {7, 12, 13, 17, 19}
16: {12, 18, 19}
17: {9, 15}
18: {5, 8, 16}
19: {15, 16}

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: [2 choose 3] = 1
- Node 4: [2 choose 3] = 1
- Node 5: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 6: [2 choose 3] = 1
- Node 7: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 8: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 9: [2 choose 3] = 1
- Node 10: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 11: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 12: [4 choose 3] = 4
- Node 13: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 14: [3 choose 3] = 1
- Node 15: [5 choose 3] = 10
- Node 18: [3 choose 3] = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].
