Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4

Now, let's look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors to identify the 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 1: <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 5: <5, (4, 11, 14)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 9, 13)>
- Node 9: <9, (7, 8, 13)>
- Node 10: <10, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 11: <11, (0, 5, 12)>
- Node 12: <12, (2, 11, 1)>
- Node 14: <14, (3, 6, 8)>

Now applying the formula \( \text{inom}{n}{3} \) to each node, we find:
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 12: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 9

So, the final answer is [9].
