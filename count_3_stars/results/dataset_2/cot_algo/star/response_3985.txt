Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 19) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 17) (1, 15) (1, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 8) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 19) (4, 17) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a visualization of the graph to better understand its structure:

```
    1 -- 15 -- 19 -- 0 -- 16
   / \    |     |     |    |
  12   3  7     2     17   11
   \ /    |     |     |    |
    0 -- 12 -- 4 -- 14 -- 8
       \  |     |     |   /
         9 -- 5 -- 13  /
             |        /
             18 -----
               |
               10
```

Now, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {12, 19, 16}
- Node 1: {15, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 7}
- Node 3: {15, 17, 5, 10}
- Node 4: {12, 14, 17}
- Node 5: {3, 9, 13}
- Node 7: {15, 2, 17}
- Node 8: {14, 18, 9}
- Node 9: {18, 12, 8, 5}
- Node 10: {3, 12, 11}
- Node 11: {10, 18, 16}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 4, 19, 9, 10}
- Node 13: {5}
- Node 14: {8, 4}
- Node 15: {1, 3, 19, 7}
- Node 16: {0, 11, 17}
- Node 17: {16, 3, 0, 7, 4}
- Node 18: {8, 11, 9}
- Node 19: {15, 12, 0}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 12, 17, 18, 19
Number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (12, 19, 16)>, <3, (15, 17, 5)>, <4, (12, 14, 17)>, <12, (0, 1, 4)>, <17, (16, 3, 0)>, <18, (8, 11, 9)>, <19, (15, 12, 0)>
