Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 16) (18, 6) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 2) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 14) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 13) (13, 3) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 3, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 12, 17}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 13, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 9, 15}
- Node 6: {5, 9, 15, 18}
- Node 7: {1, 8, 16, 19}
- Node 8: {7, 11, 19}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 10: {0, 17}
- Node 11: {8, 16, 17}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 2, 19}
- Node 13: {3}
- Node 14: {4, 9, 15}
- Node 15: {5, 6, 14}
- Node 16: {3, 7, 11, 18}
- Node 17: {1, 10, 11}
- Node 18: {6, 16}
- Node 19: {7, 8, 12}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-star structures:

- Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 10

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, 2, 3>
  - <0, 2, 10>
  - <0, 3, 12>
  - <0, 10, 12>
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <2, 0, 12>
- Node 10: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 5
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
