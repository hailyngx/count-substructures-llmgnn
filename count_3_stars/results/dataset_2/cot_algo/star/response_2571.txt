Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 2, 8, 9, 13}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 5, 9, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 4: {1, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 6, 7, 11}
- Node 6: {3, 5, 9}
- Node 7: {5, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {0, 3, 14}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 6, 10}
- Node 10: {2, 9, 12}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {3, 7, 10}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 4, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 11, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars for each:

- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 1: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 3: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 11: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 13: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 72

So, the final number of 3-stars is [72].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 2, 13>
<0, 4, 13>
<0, 8, 14>
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 6>
<1, 4, 11>
<2, 5, 11>
<3, 5, 6>
<5, 11, 13>
<5, 7, 12>
<5, 11, 14>
<9, 10, 12>
<11, 13, 14>
<13, 0, 2>
