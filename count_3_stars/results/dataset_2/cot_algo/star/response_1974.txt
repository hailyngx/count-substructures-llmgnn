Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0 neighbors: {1, 5, 6, 8, 9}
Node 1 neighbors: {0, 4, 9}
Node 2 neighbors: {3, 4, 8}
Node 3 neighbors: {2, 5, 9}
Node 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 7, 8}
Node 5 neighbors: {0, 3, 6}
Node 6 neighbors: {0, 5, 7, 8, 9}
Node 7 neighbors: {4, 6, 9}
Node 8 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
Node 9 neighbors: {0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8}

Now, let's check for each node if it has three or more neighbors, and if so, count the number of 3-stars that can be formed using that node as the center:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 6, 8, 9

For node 0, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 6, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 8, we can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
For node 9, we can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars formed, we get 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50. So, the final number inside brackets is [50].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 1, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 6, 7>
<0, 6, 8>
<0, 6, 9>
<1, 4, 8>
<1, 4, 9>
<6, 7, 9>
<8, 4, 9>
