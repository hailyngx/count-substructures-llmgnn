Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 5, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 5}
- Node 4: {3, 5, 7, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 8: {1, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 6, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {0, 7}
- Node 12: {0, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 13: {1, 6, 9, 10}
- Node 14: {2, 8, 9, 10, 12}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 14 have 5 or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 10: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 12: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 14: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 92

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [92].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
