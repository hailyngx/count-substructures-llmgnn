Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbor sets for each node. Then, for each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of unique 3-stars that can be formed with that node. 

Here are the neighbor sets for each node:

- Node 0: {14, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 6, 14, 10}
- Node 2: {5, 12, 11}
- Node 3: {8, 14, 12}
- Node 4: {8, 10}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 1, 7}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 14, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 7: {5, 9, 6, 13, 11}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 0, 10, 3}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 1, 7}
- Node 10: {6, 8, 13, 4, 1}
- Node 11: {13, 14, 2, 7}
- Node 12: {6, 2, 3}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 10, 7}
- Node 14: {6, 0, 11, 3, 1}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors: Nodes 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 14.

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding all the 3-stars together: 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 70.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [70].
