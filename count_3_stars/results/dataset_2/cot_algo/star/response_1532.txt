Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 4, 8, 9)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 7, 8, 9)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <2, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
