Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 28) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 29) (27, 22) (27, 0) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 25) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 17) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 16) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 15) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 14) (21, 4) (21, 24) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 25) (1, 5) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 15) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 23) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 24) (23, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 7) (16, 0) (16, 20) (16, 25) (26, 20) (26, 10) (26, 4) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 29) (18, 9) (18, 12) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 21) (14, 3) (14, 2) (29, 0) (29, 10) (12, 20) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 2) (7, 15) (7, 8) (15, 28) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 7) (4, 21) (4, 26) (25, 6) (25, 21) (25, 1) (25, 16) (24, 21) (24, 19) (8, 10) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {27, 16, 29}
- Node 1: Neighbors {11, 17, 25, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {13, 14, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {14, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {21, 26}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 19, 23}
- Node 6: Neighbors {28, 14, 25}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 15, 8}
- Node 8: Neighbors {10, 7}
- Node 9: Neighbors {18, 11, 17}
- Node 10: Neighbors {26, 29, 8}
- Node 11: Neighbors {9, 1}
- Node 12: Neighbors {20, 3, 18, 15}
- Node 13: Neighbors {22, 2, 19, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {13, 6, 21, 3, 2}
- Node 15: Neighbors {28, 17, 12, 7}
- Node 16: Neighbors {0, 20, 25}
- Node 17: Neighbors {9, 1, 15}
- Node 18: Neighbors {9, 12}
- Node 19: Neighbors {13, 5, 24}
- Node 20: Neighbors {26, 16, 12}
- Node 21: Neighbors {28, 25, 14, 4, 24}
- Node 22: Neighbors {13, 27, 28}
- Node 23: Neighbors {5}
- Node 24: Neighbors {21, 19}
- Node 25: Neighbors {6, 21, 1, 16}
- Node 26: Neighbors {20, 10, 4}
- Node 27: Neighbors {22, 0}
- Node 28: Neighbors {22, 6, 21, 15}
- Node 29: Neighbors {0, 10}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {27, 16, 29}: <0, (27, 16, 29)>
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {17, 25, 21}: <1, (17, 25, 21)>
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {20, 18, 15}: <12, (20, 18, 15)>
- Node 14 forms 1 3-star with neighbors {6, 21, 3}: <14, (6, 21, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
