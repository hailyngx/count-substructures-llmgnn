Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 2: 1, 7, 8, 9
Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 4: 0, 3, 5
Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7
Node 6: 3, 8
Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8
Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

For each node with 3 or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center by using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

Calculating for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 48

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
