Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 8
- Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Nodes 2 and 4 have 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars per node, so 6 nodes * 10 = 60 3-stars.
- For node 1 with 4 neighbors: No 3-stars can be formed.
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star per node, so 2 nodes * 1 = 2 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 60 + 2 = 62, which we will represent as [62].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 6)>
<5, (8, 0, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (2, 0, 3)>
<8, (2, 0, 5)>
<8, (2, 1, 5)>
