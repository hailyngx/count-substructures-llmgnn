Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {5, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {5, 3, 2, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 1, 3, 7}
- Node 3: {5, 1, 7, 0, 2, 4}
- Node 4: {9, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 6, 8, 1, 0, 3}
- Node 6: {5, 8}
- Node 7: {9, 1, 3, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 4, 2, 7}

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 66 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [66].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 7)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<7, (9, 1, 3)>
