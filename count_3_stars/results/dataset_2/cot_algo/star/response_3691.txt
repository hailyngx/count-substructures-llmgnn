Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 5
- Node 9: 3, 4

Next, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 3, Node 7

For each of these nodes, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors. Then we sum up the total number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 = 40

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [40].

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 3>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 3>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 3, 5>, <0, 3, 8>, <1, 2, 7>, <1, 3, 7>, <1, 5, 7>, <2, 3, 7>, <3, 5, 8>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 8>, <4, 7, 9>, <5, 6, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <6, 7, 8>
