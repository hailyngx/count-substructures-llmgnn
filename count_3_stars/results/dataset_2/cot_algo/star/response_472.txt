Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 0) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 29) (9, 15) (1, 11) (1, 21) (1, 6) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 13) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 13) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 2) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 28) (7, 20) (19, 8) (19, 22) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 27) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 25) (6, 2) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 22) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 29) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 17) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 4) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 13) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 23) (14, 28) (14, 4) (14, 13) (27, 3) (27, 8) (27, 17) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 4) (24, 4) (24, 13) (24, 18) (4, 17) (4, 23) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 24) (29, 5) (29, 22) (29, 25) (2, 28) (2, 6) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 14) (13, 24) (18, 21) (18, 0) (18, 24) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

1. Explore the neighbor nodes for each node:
   - Node 0: Neighbors {11, 16, 18}
   - Node 1: Neighbors {6, 11, 21}
   - Node 2: Neighbors {6, 28}
   - Node 3: Neighbors {13, 15, 27}
   - Node 4: Neighbors {13, 14, 17, 23, 24, 25}
   - Node 5: Neighbors {16, 29}
   - Node 6: Neighbors {1, 2, 17, 25}
   - Node 7: Neighbors {14, 20, 28}
   - Node 8: Neighbors {16, 19, 27}
   - Node 9: Neighbor {15}
   - Node 10: Neighbors {12, 21, 22}
   - Node 12: Neighbors {10, 16, 17}
   - Node 13: Neighbors {3, 14, 15, 23, 24}
   - Node 14: Neighbors {4, 13, 28}
   - Node 15: Neighbors {3, 9, 13}
   - Node 16: Neighbors {0, 5, 8, 12}
   - Node 17: Neighbors {4, 6, 12, 27}
   - Node 18: Neighbors {0, 21, 24}
   - Node 19: Neighbors {8, 22}
   - Node 20: Neighbors {7, 22, 23}
   - Node 21: Neighbors {1, 10, 18}
   - Node 22: Neighbors {10, 20, 29}
   - Node 23: Neighbors {4, 13, 20}
   - Node 24: Neighbors {4, 13, 18}
   - Node 25: Neighbors {4, 6, 29}
   - Node 27: Neighbors {3, 8, 17}
   - Node 28: Neighbors {2, 7, 11, 14}
   - Node 29: Neighbors {5, 22, 25}

2. Calculate the total number of 3-stars (3-node star subgraphs):
   - Node 0 forms 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors: <0, (11, 16, 18)>
   - Node 1 forms 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors: <1, (6, 11, 21)>
   - Node 4 forms 1 3-star because it has exactly 3 neighbors: <4, (17, 24, 25)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
