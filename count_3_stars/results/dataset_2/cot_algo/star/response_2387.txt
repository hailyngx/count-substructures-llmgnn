Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 21) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 28) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 29) (17, 16) (17, 29) (17, 24) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 10) (22, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 20) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 15) (27, 3) (27, 14) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 25) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 15) (21, 11) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 2) (10, 1) (10, 29) (10, 19) (19, 10) (8, 5) (8, 25) (28, 5) (28, 2) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 28) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 6) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 24) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 12) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 26) (13, 23) (13, 25) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 13) (6, 11) (6, 20) (6, 12) (12, 0) (12, 23) (12, 6) (24, 17) (24, 4) (24, 18) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 12}
- Node 1: {3, 10}
- Node 2: {21, 26, 28}
- Node 3: {1, 18, 27, 29}
- Node 4: {14, 15, 24}
- Node 5: {8, 18, 28}
- Node 6: {11, 12, 20}
- Node 7: {0, 11, 20}
- Node 8: {5, 25}
- Node 9: {23}
- Node 10: {1, 19, 29}
- Node 11: {6, 7, 16, 21}
- Node 12: {0, 6, 23}
- Node 13: {23, 25}
- Node 14: {4, 22, 25, 26, 27}
- Node 15: {4, 15, 16, 26}
- Node 16: {11, 15, 17, 21}
- Node 17: {16, 24, 29}
- Node 18: {3, 5, 23, 24}
- Node 19: {10}
- Node 20: {6, 7, 26}
- Node 21: {2, 11, 16, 25}
- Node 22: {14}
- Node 23: {9, 12, 13, 18}
- Node 24: {4, 17, 18}
- Node 25: {8, 14, 21, 13}
- Node 26: {2, 14, 15, 20}
- Node 27: {1, 3, 14}
- Node 28: {2, 5}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3, Node 11, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 21, Node 23, Node 24, Node 25, and Node 26.

Calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 44.

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [44], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <3, (1, 18, 27)>
- <11, (6, 7, 16)>
- <14, (4, 25, 26)>
- <15, (4, 16, 26)>
- <16, (11, 15, 21)>
- <17, (16, 24, 29)>
- <18, (3, 5, 23)>
- <21, (2, 11, 25)>
- <23, (12, 13, 18)>
- <24, (4, 17, 18)>
- <25, (8, 14, 21)>
- <26, (2, 15, 20)>
