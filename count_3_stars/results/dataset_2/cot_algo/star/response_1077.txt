Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {1, 6, 11, 12}
- Node 1: {0, 4, 5, 9, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 4: {1, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 10, 11}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 9, 14}
- Node 9: {1, 5, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 11: {0, 2, 3, 6, 10, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 13: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 14: {3, 5, 8, 11}

Now we can see which nodes have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:
- Node 1: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 5: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 11: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 14: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Adding these up, we get a total of 20 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 74 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [74].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <1, (0, 5, 12)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (5, 9, 13)>
- <1, (5, 9, 14)>
- <1, (5, 12, 13)>
- <5, (1, 9, 13)>
- <5, (1, 9, 14)>
- <5, (1, 12, 13)>
- <5, (9, 12, 13)>
- <9, (1, 5, 13)>
- <9, (1, 5, 14)>
- <9, (5, 8, 13)>
- <9, (5, 10, 13)>
- <9, (5, 13, 14)>
- <11, (0, 6, 11)>
- <11, (2, 6, 10)>
- <11, (2, 10, 14)>
- <11, (3, 6, 11)>
- <11, (3, 8, 11)>
- <14, (3, 8, 11)>
