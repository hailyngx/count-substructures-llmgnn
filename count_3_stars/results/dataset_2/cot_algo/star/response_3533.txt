Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we can first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {6, 7}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 4}
- Node 3: Neighbors {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 4, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 7, 9}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 5, 6, 7}

Now, we will find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 8, and 9: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 6, and 7: <9, (4, 6, 7)>

There are a total of 2 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [2].
