Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {4, 7, 8, 2, 9}
- Node 1: Neighbors {7, 8, 5, 9}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 0}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 8, 6}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 8, 0, 5, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {4, 6, 2, 1}
- Node 6: Neighbors {4, 7, 5, 3}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 0, 3, 6, 9, 1}
- Node 8: Neighbors {4, 0, 3, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 0, 1}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: [C(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 1: [C(6, 3)] = 20
- Node 4: [C(5, 3)] = 10
- Node 5: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 6: [C(4, 3)] = 4
- Node 7: [C(6, 3)] = 20

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 68

Therefore, the final answer is [68].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<5, (4, 6, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 7)>
<7, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 7)>
