Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the set of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 6: {0, 5}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 3, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 3 can form a 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 5 can form a 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 3)>
- Node 0, Node 1, and Node 9 can form a 3-star: <1, (0, 9, 3)>
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 7 can form a 3-star: <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 0, Node 4, and Node 5 can form a 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 1)>
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 5 can form a 3-star: <3, (1, 5, 0)>
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 7 can form a 3-star: <1, (3, 7, 2)>
- Node 1, Node 4, and Node 5 can form a 3-star: <1, (4, 5, 0)>
- Node 2, Node 7, and Node 8 can form a 3-star: <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 3, Node 7, and Node 9 can form a 3-star: <3, (7, 9, 1)>

Thus, a total of 9 unique 3-stars were found, resulting in a final count of [9].
