Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 11) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (19, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 11) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {17, 8, 13, 18}
- Node 1: {3, 17, 18}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 10}
- Node 3: {1, 10, 13, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 12}
- Node 5: {15, 4, 11}
- Node 6: {2, 14, 12}
- Node 7: {10}
- Node 8: {0, 18, 11}
- Node 9: {13, 12}
- Node 10: {3, 7, 15, 14, 2}
- Node 11: {15, 8, 19, 5}
- Node 12: {6, 9, 4}
- Node 13: {9, 0, 3}
- Node 14: {6, 15, 10, 16}
- Node 15: {10, 5, 11, 14}
- Node 16: {17, 14}
- Node 17: {0, 1, 16}
- Node 18: {1, 8, 0}
- Node 19: {11}

Next, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 17, 18) - <0, (17, 18)>
- Node 1: (1, 17, 18) - <1, (17, 18)>
- Node 3: (1, 3, 10) - <3, (1, 10)>
- Node 10: (3, 10, 15), (3, 10, 14), (10, 15, 14) - <10, (3, 15, 14)>
- Node 11: (8, 11, 15) - <11, (8, 15)>
- Node 15: (5, 11, 15), (10, 14, 15) - <15, (5, 11)>
- Node 17: (0, 1, 16) - <17, (0, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
