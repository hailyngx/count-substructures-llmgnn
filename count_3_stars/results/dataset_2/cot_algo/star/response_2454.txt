Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 5) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 15) (2, 9) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {13, 7, 19}
Node 1: {16, 4, 8}
Node 2: {15, 9}
Node 3: {15, 14, 17}
Node 4: {1, 5, 10}
Node 5: {11, 4, 7}
Node 6: {9, 10, 19, 8}
Node 7: {14, 5, 0}
Node 8: {6, 1, 13}
Node 9: {6, 2, 19}
Node 10: {16, 6, 4, 12}
Node 11: {16, 5}
Node 12: {16, 14, 10}
Node 13: {8, 0}
Node 14: {3, 17, 7, 18, 12}
Node 15: {16, 3, 2}
Node 16: {11, 12, 15, 1, 10}
Node 17: {3, 14}
Node 18: {14}
Node 19: {6, 9, 0}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 14 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 16 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars formed by nodes with 3 or more neighbors, we have a total of 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 3-stars.
Therefore, the final answer is [24] and the unique 3-stars found are <6, (9, 10, 19)>, <14, (3, 17, 7)>, and <16, (11, 12, 15)>.
