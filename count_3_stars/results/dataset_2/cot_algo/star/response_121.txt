Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we will first build the adjacency list for each node to determine their neighbors. Then we will count the number of 3-stars formed in the graph.

### Adjacency List:
- Node 0: {8, 13, 11, 7, 10, 12}
- Node 1: {5, 9, 6, 2, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 12, 10}
- Node 3: {6, 9}
- Node 4: {8, 13, 9, 5}
- Node 5: {4, 12, 1, 11, 14}
- Node 6: {8, 3, 11, 7, 1}
- Node 7: {6, 0, 9}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 9, 0, 6}
- Node 9: {8, 4, 3, 7, 1, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 2, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 0, 6}
- Node 12: {5, 0, 9, 2}
- Node 13: {8, 4, 0}
- Node 14: {5, 1, 10}

### 3-Stars Calculation:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with {8, 13, 11}, {8, 13, 12}, {8, 11, 12}. Total: 3
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with {5, 9, 6}, {5, 9, 14}. Total: 2
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with {8, 9, 5}. Total: 1
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with {4, 1, 11}, {4, 1, 14}, {11, 6, 1}. Total: 3
- Node 6 forms 3-stars with {8, 3, 7}, {8, 3, 6}. Total: 2
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with {13, 4, 9}. Total: 1
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with {8, 4, 12}, {8, 3, 1}. Total: 2

Counting the total, we find that there are 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 14 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [14], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 8, 13>
- <0, 8, 11>
- <0, 8, 12>
- <1, 5, 9>
- <1, 5, 14>
- <4, 5, 11>
- <4, 5, 14>
- <6, 8, 3>
- <6, 8, 7>
- <9, 8, 4>
- <9, 8, 12>
- <9, 3, 8>
- <9, 4, 12>
- <11, 5, 1>
