Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 12, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {7, 6, 12, 9, 14}
- Node 2: {11, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 0, 9}
- Node 4: {12, 10, 3}
- Node 5: {7, 10, 6, 0}
- Node 6: {11, 13, 5, 1}
- Node 7: {3, 5, 1}
- Node 8: {10, 13, 9, 12}
- Node 9: {8, 0, 14, 3, 1}
- Node 10: {4, 12, 8, 13, 5}
- Node 11: {14, 6, 2}
- Node 12: {4, 10, 8, 0, 1}
- Node 13: {10, 8, 2, 6}
- Node 14: {11, 9, 1, 2}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46 \). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (7, 9, 12)>
- <1, (6, 9, 12)>
- <1, (7, 9, 5)>
- <1, (6, 9, 5)>
- <1, (12, 0, 9)>
- <1, (12, 9, 14)>
- <1, (12, 0, 5)>
- <1, (12, 9, 5)>
- <3, (4, 7, 0)>
- <5, (7, 10, 6)>
- <9, (8, 14, 1)>
- <9, (0, 14, 1)>
- <9, (0, 14, 1)>
- <9, (3, 0, 9)>
- <12, (8, 0, 1)>
- <12, (8, 0, 9)>
- <12, (8, 1, 9)>
- <14, (11, 2, 13)>
