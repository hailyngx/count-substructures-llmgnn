Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (15, 14) (15, 3) (15, 12) (13, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 15) (12, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 0) (6, 10) (6, 16) (0, 5) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (7, 5) (7, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be computed in the following way:

1. For each node, calculate the number of neighbors it has based on the given edges.
2. For each node that has three or more neighbors, calculate the number of 3-stars it is part of using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).
3. Sum up the total number of 3-stars formed by all such nodes.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 4}. It does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 2, 10, 8, 18}. It has 5 neighbors, so 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 11, 19, 17}. It has 4 neighbors, so 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 15, 10, 8}. It has 4 neighbors, so 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 4: Neighbors {19, 16, 0}. It has 3 neighbors, so 3-stars = 1.
- Node 5: Neighbors {9, 13, 0, 7}. It has 4 neighbors, so 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 6: Neighbors {10, 16}. It does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 14}. It does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3}. It does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Neighbors {5, 18, 17}. It has 3 neighbors, so 3-stars = 1.
- Node 10: Neighbors {1, 6, 11, 3}. It has 4 neighbors, so 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Node 11: Neighbors {14, 10, 2}. It has 3 neighbors, so 3-stars = 1.
- Node 12: Neighbors {15, 19}. It does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 13: Neighbors {5}. It does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 14: Neighbors {11, 7, 15}. It has 3 neighbors, so 3-stars = 1.
- Node 15: Neighbors {14, 12, 3}. It does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 16: Neighbors {4, 6}. It does not have 3 neighbors.
- Node 17: Neighbors {9, 2, 19}. It has 3 neighbors, so 3-stars = 1.
- Node 18: Neighbors {9, 1, 19}. It has 3 neighbors, so 3-stars = 1.
- Node 19: Neighbors {17, 2, 4, 18, 12}. It has 5 neighbors, so 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Summing up the 3-stars:
\[10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 37\]

The total number of 3-stars is [37].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 2, 3>, <19, 1, 18>, <19, 1, 12>, <19, 1, 2>, <19, 1, 4>, <19, 1, 8>, <8, 1, 3>, <4, 16, 0>, <14, 11, 2>, <10, 11, 2>, <17, 2, 19>, <19, 2, 17>, <5, 7, 14>, <5, 7, 0>, <5, 13, 9>.
