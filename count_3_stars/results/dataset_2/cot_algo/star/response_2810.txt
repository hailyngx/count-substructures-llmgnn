Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 1) (2, 12) (2, 21) (2, 11) (2, 0) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 3) (6, 10) (6, 23) (28, 21) (28, 16) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 15) (4, 12) (18, 17) (18, 3) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 8) (17, 18) (17, 16) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 27) (16, 28) (16, 13) (16, 17) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (15, 21) (15, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 23) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 12) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 23) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 22) (0, 2) (10, 6) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 22) (22, 5) (22, 25) (22, 14) (22, 24) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 24) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 3) (27, 29) (27, 13) (27, 20) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

- Node 0: {2}
- Node 1: {9, 11, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {12, 21, 11, 0}
- Node 3: {29, 18, 24}
- Node 4: {12}
- Node 5: {9, 22, 11}
- Node 6: {10, 23}
- Node 7: {29, 1, 19, 25, 14}
- Node 8: {21, 26, 20, 1, 19}
- Node 9: {5, 24, 1}
- Node 10: {6}
- Node 11: {5, 2, 1, 23}
- Node 12: {2, 21, 4, 20, 23}
- Node 13: {26, 16, 27}
- Node 14: {15, 7, 22}
- Node 15: {21, 14}
- Node 16: {28, 13, 17}
- Node 17: {18, 16}
- Node 18: {17, 3}
- Node 19: {8, 7}
- Node 20: {12, 8, 27}
- Node 21: {2, 28, 12, 8, 15}
- Node 22: {5, 25, 14, 24}
- Node 23: {6, 11, 12}
- Node 24: {9, 22, 3}
- Node 25: {26, 7, 22}
- Node 26: {13, 25, 8}
- Node 27: {29, 13, 20}
- Node 28: {21, 16}
- Node 29: {7, 27, 3}

Now, let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:

For each node:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 10 has 1 neighbor => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 17 has 2 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 19 has 2 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 21 has 5 neighbors => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 24 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 26 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 27 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 28 has 2 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors => Not enough neighbors to form 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 38, which we represent as [38].
