Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph, we first need to find the neighbor nodes for each node. Based on the given edges, the neighbor sets for each node are as follows:

1. Node 0 neighbors: {5, 6, 1}
2. Node 1 neighbors: {4, 6, 2, 0}
3. Node 2 neighbors: {9, 7, 6, 1, 3}
4. Node 3 neighbors: {4, 7, 6, 2, 8}
5. Node 4 neighbors: {1, 6, 3}
6. Node 5 neighbors: {9, 6, 8, 0, 7}
7. Node 6 neighbors: {5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0, 7}
8. Node 7 neighbors: {5, 3, 2, 8}
9. Node 8 neighbors: {5, 7, 3}
10. Node 9 neighbors: {5, 2}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star subgraphs using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
2. Node 1: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
3. Node 2: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
4. Node 3: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
5. Node 4: Not applicable (Less than 3 neighbors)
6. Node 5: \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
7. Node 6: \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
8. Node 7: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
9. Node 8: Not applicable (Less than 3 neighbors)
10. Node 9: Not applicable (Less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-star subgraphs = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 59

Therefore, the final answer is [59], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (5, 6, 1)>, <1, (4, 6, 2)>, <2, (9, 7, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, 6)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 1, 3, 2)>, <7, (5, 3, 2)>.
