Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 9, 2
- Node 1: 7, 3, 6, 2
- Node 2: 7, 1, 6, 9, 0
- Node 3: 4, 7, 1, 0
- Node 4: 7, 9, 3, 6
- Node 5: 7, 6, 8
- Node 6: 4, 1, 9, 5, 2, 8
- Node 7: 4, 3, 1, 5, 2
- Node 8: 6, 5
- Node 9: 6, 4, 2, 0

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <1, (7, 3, 2)>, <1, (7, 3, 6)>, <1, (7, 3, 1)>, <1, (3, 6, 2)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <2, (7, 1, 6)>, <2, (7, 1, 9)>, <2, (7, 1, 0)>, <2, (7, 6, 9)>, <2, (7, 6, 0)>, <2, (7, 9, 0)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 0)>, <2, (1, 9, 0)>, <2, (6, 9, 0)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <3, (4, 7, 1)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 1, 0)>, <3, (7, 1, 0)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <4, (7, 3, 6)>, <4, (7, 3, 1)>, <4, (3, 6, 6)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  <6, (4, 1, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 9, 8)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (4, 1, 2)>, <6, (4, 9, 5)>, <6, (4, 6, 2)>, <6, (1, 9, 5)>, <6, (1, 6, 2)>, <6, (9, 5, 6)>, <6, (4, 9, 6)>, <6, (4, 2, 6)>, <6, (9, 2, 6)>, <6, (1, 9, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <7, (4, 3, 1)>, <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <7, (4, 1, 6)>, <7, (3, 1, 6)>, <7, (3, 1, 2)>, <7, (1, 6, 5)>, <7, (1, 6, 2)>, <7, (6, 5, 8)>, <7, (6, 2, 8)>, <7, (5, 2, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 52

Therefore, the final answer is [52].
