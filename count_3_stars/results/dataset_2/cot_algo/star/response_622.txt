Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (8, 5) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) 

Response:
The graph described has the following neighbor sets for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 7, 14}
- Node 1: {7, 10, 12}
- Node 2: {3, 4, 7, 11, 13}
- Node 3: {0. 2, 5, 7, 10}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 12}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 8, 12}
- Node 6: {0, 4, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 2, 3}
- Node 8: {5, 10}
- Node 9: {11, 13, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 3, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 9, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 5, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 13: {2, 6, 9, 12}
- Node 14: {0, 9, 10}

After examining the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and applying the \( \binom{n}{3} \) calculation, we find that there are a total of [16] 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 14)>
- <0, (3, 7, 10)>
- <0, (5, 12, 4)>
- <0, (5, 12, 10)>
- <2, (3, 7, 13)>
- <2, (4, 12, 11)>
- <2, (11, 12, 13)>
- <3, (0, 5, 12)>
- <3, (0, 7, 10)>
- <4, (5, 12, 6)>
- <5, (0, 3, 12)>
- <5, (4, 6, 12)>
- <9, (10, 12, 14)>
- <10, (1, 12, 14)>
- <10, (5, 8, 12)>
- <12, (1, 4, 5)>
