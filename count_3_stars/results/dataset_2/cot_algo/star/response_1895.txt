Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (17, 14) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 1) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 14) (18, 0) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 8, 9, 14, 18
Node 1: 0, 8, 11, 13
Node 2: 6, 7, 19
Node 3: 6, 14
Node 4: 7, 8, 12
Node 5: 10, 11
Node 6: 2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 15
Node 7: 2, 4, 9, 10
Node 8: 0, 1, 4
Node 9: 0, 7, 9, 10, 16
Node 10: 5, 7, 9, 10, 15
Node 11: 1, 5, 6, 11
Node 12: 4, 6, 12, 15
Node 13: 1
Node 14: 0, 3, 14, 17, 18
Node 15: 6, 10, 12
Node 16: 9, 19
Node 17: 14
Node 18: 0, 14, 18
Node 19: 2, 16

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Node 0, Node 14, Node 6, and Node 9 each have 5 or more neighbors, so we will count the number of 3-stars they can form.

For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 50 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (1, 8, 18)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (1, 9, 18)>
<0, (8, 9, 18)>
<14, (3, 17, 18)>
<6, (2, 11, 12)>
<6, (11, 11, 12)>
<9, (7, 10, 16)>
