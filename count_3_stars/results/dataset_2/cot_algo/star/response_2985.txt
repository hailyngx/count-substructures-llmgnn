Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) 

Response:
The first step is to determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {11, 6, 14, 3}
- Node 1: Neighbors {4, 11, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6, 14, 3, 12}
- Node 3: Neighbors {7, 10, 11, 2, 0, 12}
- Node 4: Neighbors {13, 10, 1}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 11, 13, 2}
- Node 6: Neighbors {13, 2, 0}
- Node 7: Neighbors {3, 14, 9, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 9, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {7, 10, 8, 14}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 11, 3, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {10, 3, 1, 0, 5}
- Node 12: Neighbors {8, 2, 3}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 8, 5, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 2, 0, 1, 9}

Next, we count the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 11: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the final answer is [62], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (11, 3, 14)>, <2, (5, 6, 14)>, <3, (0, 11, 12)>, <10, (4, 9, 11)>, <11, (0, 5, 10)>, <14, (1, 9, 2)>
