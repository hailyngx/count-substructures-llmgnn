Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 5, 9
- Node 1: 4, 3, 9
- Node 2: 7, 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 9, 2, 5
- Node 4: 7, 1
- Node 5: 7, 3, 8, 0, 2
- Node 6: 7, 3
- Node 7: 4, 0, 6, 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9, 5, 0
- Node 9: 1, 3, 8, 0, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, 5: <7, (0, 8, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, 2: <3, (1, 9, 2)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, 0: <5, (7, 8, 0)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, 5: <0, (7, 9, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, 2: <9, (1, 8, 2)>

Since each 3-star is unique, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5. Therefore, the answer is [5].
