Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 15) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (18, 12) (18, 19) (17, 3) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 15) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 19) (10, 9) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 15) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {9, 0}
- Node 2: {9, 3, 7, 13, 19}
- Node 3: {17, 13, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 13, 15}
- Node 5: {9, 13, 4, 7}
- Node 6: {0}
- Node 7: {5, 12, 0, 2}
- Node 8: {0, 14}
- Node 9: {5, 1, 10, 19, 2}
- Node 10: {9}
- Node 11: {16, 19}
- Node 12: {7, 14, 18, 15}
- Node 13: {5, 3, 4, 2}
- Node 14: {16, 12, 8, 15}
- Node 15: {12, 14, 4}
- Node 16: {11, 14}
- Node 17: {3}
- Node 18: {12, 19}
- Node 19: {11, 9, 18, 2}

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: 0
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 0
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 0
- Node 11: 0
- Node 12: 1
- Node 13: 0
- Node 14: 1
- Node 15: 0
- Node 16: 0
- Node 17: 0
- Node 18: 0
- Node 19: 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (13, 4, 15)>, <4, (5, 13, 15)>, <7, (5, 12, 2)>, <9, (5, 1, 2)>, <12, (7, 14, 15)>, <14, (16, 12, 8)>
