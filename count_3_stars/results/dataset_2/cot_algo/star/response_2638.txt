Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {12}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 2: {5, 8, 9, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 11, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {3, 4, 6, 10, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 10, 14}
- Node 10: {1, 7, 9, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 12: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 13: {7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 14: {4, 9, 10, 11}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up all the 3-stars formed by each node, we get: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [68].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 3, 5>
<1, 3, 10>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 4, 10>
<1, 5, 9>
<1, 10, 14>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 11>
<2, 8, 13>
<2, 11, 14>
<4, 7, 10>
<4, 7, 13>
<4, 11, 14>
<7, 10, 13>
<9, 10, 14>
