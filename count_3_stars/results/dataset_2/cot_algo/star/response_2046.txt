Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 24) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 19) (27, 3) (27, 25) (27, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 10) (22, 23) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 28) (20, 6) (20, 9) (20, 25) (25, 27) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 24) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 8) (7, 12) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 21) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 24) (8, 18) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 16) (16, 12) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 2) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 10) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 17) (2, 16) (2, 26) (2, 1) (26, 7) (26, 11) (26, 2) (26, 17) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (28, 0) (28, 23) (24, 15) (24, 25) (24, 21) (24, 8) (4, 19) (4, 17) (29, 25) (29, 8) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 1) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 1) (17, 23) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {28, 5, 19}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 14, 10}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 26, 16}
- Node 3: Neighbors {15, 27, 5}
- Node 4: Neighbors {19, 17}
- Node 5: Neighbors {3, 0, 21}
- Node 6: Neighbors {15, 9, 20}
- Node 7: Neighbors {12, 26}
- Node 8: Neighbors {18, 24, 29, 16}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 20, 10}
- Node 10: Neighbors {9, 19, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors {18, 26, 17}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 16}
- Node 14: Neighbors {15, 27, 18, 1}
- Node 15: Neighbors {3, 6, 14, 24}
- Node 16: Neighbors {12, 21, 8, 2}
- Node 17: Neighbors {23, 11, 26, 4}
- Node 18: Neighbors {14, 11, 8}
- Node 19: Neighbors {0, 4, 10}
- Node 20: Neighbors {6, 9, 25}
- Node 21: Neighbors {5, 16, 24}
- Node 22: Neighbors {23, 25}
- Node 23: Neighbors {22, 17, 28}
- Node 24: Neighbors {15, 25, 21, 8}
- Node 25: Neighbors {27, 22, 20, 29, 24}
- Node 26: Neighbors {7, 11, 2, 17}
- Node 27: Neighbors {3, 14, 25}
- Node 28: Neighbors {0, 23}
- Node 29: Neighbors {25, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0, 3, 5, 15, 24, and 25 each have more than 3 neighbors. 
- We will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 24: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 25: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 21
Thus, the final number of 3-stars is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 19>, <3, 15, 27>, <15, 24, 25>, <15, 24, 8>, <15, 24, 21>, <15, 25, 20>, <15, 25, 29>, <15, 25, 8>, <24, 25, 21>, <24, 25, 8>, <24, 21, 16>, <24, 8, 16>, <24, 8, 29>, <25, 21, 16>, <25, 21, 24>, <25, 21, 8>, <25, 16, 2>, <25, 8, 16>, <25, 8, 29>, <16, 21, 8>, <16, 21, 24>
