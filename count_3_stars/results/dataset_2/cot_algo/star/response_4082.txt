Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in terms of its adjacency list:

Node 0: 5, 4, 7, 1, 6
Node 1: 3, 0, 8
Node 2: 7, 6, 8
Node 3: 7, 1
Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 0
Node 5: 6, 8, 4, 0
Node 6: 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 0
Node 7: 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, 2
Node 8: 5, 4, 1, 6, 2
Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's find the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: 5, 4, 7, 1, 6 => 5, 4, 7, 1, 6
Node 1: 3, 0, 8 => 3, 0, 8
Node 2: 7, 6, 8 => 7, 6, 8
Node 3: 7, 1 => 7, 1
Node 4: 5, 7, 8, 0 => 5, 7, 8, 0
Node 5: 6, 8, 4, 0 => 6, 8, 4, 0
Node 6: 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 0 => 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 0
Node 7: 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, 2 => 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, 2
Node 8: 5, 4, 1, 6, 2 => 5, 4, 1, 6, 2
Node 9: 6, 7 => 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 6 has 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 0 as neighbors, which form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Node 7 has 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, 2 as neighbors, which form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 40 (20 + 20), which can be represented as [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 2, 8)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 2, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<7, (9, 3, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (0, 6, 2)>
