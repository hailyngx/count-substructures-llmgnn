Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 5, 7
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 5>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 8, 9>
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: No 3-stars formed
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <4, 5, 7>, <5, 7, 8>, <5, 7, 9>, <5, 8, 9>, <3, 5, 6>, <1, 5, 8>, <0, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 5>
- Node 6: No 3-stars formed
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) <0, 1, 8>, <0, 2, 8>, <0, 2, 9>, <1, 2, 8>, <1, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 5, 9>, <2, 6, 8>, <2, 6, 9>, <5, 7, 8>
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].
