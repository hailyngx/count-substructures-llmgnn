Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7}
- Node 1: {4, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {5, 6, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {4, 9, 11}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {2, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 6: {2, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 7: {0, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 8: {1, 7, 9, 11}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 8, 14}
- Node 10: {2, 6, 7, 11, 12}
- Node 11: {3, 7, 8, 10}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 10, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 2, 6, 12}
- Node 14: {1, 2, 9}

Nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12 each have 5 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes.
Let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 1: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars
For Node 2: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars
For Node 4: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars
For Node 5: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
For Node 7: \(C(6, 3) = 20\) 3-stars
For Node 10: \(C(5, 3) = 10\) 3-stars
For Node 12: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars

Total 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 68

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [68].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, 4, 8, 13>, <1, 4, 14>, <1, 8, 14>, <2, 5, 13>, <2, 5, 14>, <2, 6, 13>, <2, 6, 14>, <2, 10, 12>, <4, 5, 12>, <4, 9, 14>, <5, 6, 7>, <6, 10, 12>, <7, 8, 10>, <7, 10, 11>, <7, 10, 12>, <9, 11, 14>
