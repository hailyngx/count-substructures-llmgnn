Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 17) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 16) (14, 13) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (15, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 18) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 3) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 17) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 12) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 3) (16, 14) (16, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {13, 18, 19}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 19}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 8, 13, 18}
- Node 4: Neighbors {9, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6, 11, 12}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 5, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 8: Neighbors {3, 10}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 17}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 8, 12, 16}
- Node 11: Neighbors {5, 6, 18}
- Node 12: Neighbors {5, 6, 10, 17}
- Node 13: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 14}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 4, 13, 16}
- Node 15: Neighbors {6}
- Node 16: Neighbors {10, 14}
- Node 17: Neighbors {9, 12, 19}
- Node 18: Neighbors {1, 3, 11}
- Node 19: Neighbors {1, 2, 17}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5 has neighbors {6, 11, 12}, forming 1 3-star: <5, (6, 11, 12)>
- Node 6 has neighbors {2, 5, 11, 12, 15}, forming 1 3-star: <6, (5, 11, 12)>
- Node 10 has neighbors {0, 8, 12, 16}, forming 1 3-star: <10, (0, 12, 16)>
- Node 12 has neighbors {5, 6, 10, 17}, forming 1 3-star: <12, (5, 6, 17)>
- Node 13 has neighbors {0, 1, 3, 14}, forming 1 3-star: <13, (0, 1, 14)>
- Node 14 has neighbors {0, 4, 13, 16}, forming 1 3-star: <14, (0, 13, 16)>

The total number of 3-stars formed is 5. Therefore, the answer is [5].
