Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5, 13, 14
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 8, 10, 13
- Node 3: 6, 7, 10, 11, 12
- Node 4: 6, 7, 14
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5, 11, 13
- Node 7: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7, 13
- Node 9: 5, 7
- Node 10: 2, 3, 11, 14
- Node 11: 3, 6, 10, 12, 13
- Node 12: 0, 3, 11, 13
- Node 13: 0, 2, 6, 8, 11, 12
- Node 14: 0, 4, 10

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5: <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (7, 9, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 9, 5)>
- Node 7: <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 13: <13, (2, 8, 11)>, <13, (8, 11, 12)>, <13, (11, 12, 3)>, <13, (12, 3, 6)>, <13, (3, 6, 11)>
- Node 0: <0, (5, 13, 14)>, <0, (13, 14, 4)>
- Node 3: <3, (6, 10, 11)>, <3, (10, 11, 12)>
- Node 10: <10, (2, 11, 12)>, <10, (11, 12, 3)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of 14. Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
