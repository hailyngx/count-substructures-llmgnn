Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 10) (2, 29) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 0) (3, 25) (3, 13) (3, 12) (25, 2) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 8) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 15) (18, 6) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 21) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (7, 25) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 15) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 21) (6, 18) (6, 1) (21, 4) (21, 26) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 20) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 0) (19, 4) (19, 8) (27, 25) (27, 1) (1, 6) (1, 27) (1, 28) (14, 15) (10, 16) (10, 4) (10, 26) (10, 28) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 9) (5, 20) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 14) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 10) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 5) (24, 22) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {9, 17, 29}
- Node 1: {6, 27, 28}
- Node 2: {9, 20, 25, 28, 29}
- Node 3: {12, 13, 25}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 10, 19, 21}
- Node 5: {20}
- Node 6: {1, 18}
- Node 7: {9, 17, 25}
- Node 8: {4, 19, 20, 25}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 4, 7}
- Node 10: {4, 16, 26, 28}
- Node 11: {12, 20}
- Node 12: {3, 11, 15}
- Node 13: {3, 17, 18, 20}
- Node 14: {15}
- Node 15: {12, 14, 23}
- Node 16: {10, 17}
- Node 17: {0, 7, 13, 16, 28}
- Node 18: {6, 13}
- Node 19: {4, 8}
- Node 20: {2, 5, 11, 13}
- Node 21: {4, 26}
- Node 22: {23, 24, 26}
- Node 23: {15, 22}
- Node 24: {22}
- Node 25: {2, 3, 7, 8, 27}
- Node 26: {10, 21, 22}
- Node 27: {1, 25}
- Node 28: {1, 2, 10, 17}
- Node 29: {0, 2}

Next, we identify nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 28, 29}. <2, (9, 28, 29)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with neighbors {9, 19, 21}. <4, (9, 19, 21)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors {19, 20, 25}. <8, (19, 20, 25)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 4, 7}. <9, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with neighbors {11, 15, 3}. <12, (11, 15, 3)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors {17, 20, 3}. <13, (17, 20, 3)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 13, 28}. <17, (0, 13, 28)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 7, 8}. <25, (2, 7, 8)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 10, 17}. <28, (1, 10, 17)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
