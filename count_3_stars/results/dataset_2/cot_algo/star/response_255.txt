Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 3) (26, 12) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 8) (21, 29) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (27, 14) (27, 7) (27, 13) (27, 5) (3, 26) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 22) (22, 15) (23, 17) (23, 14) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 5) (17, 23) (17, 5) (29, 21) (29, 10) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 25) (7, 24) (7, 19) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 16) (8, 21) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 6) (14, 27) (14, 23) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 5) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 6) (24, 11) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 10) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 2) (11, 24) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 15) (10, 29) (10, 8) (10, 12) (5, 27) (5, 20) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 28) (13, 0) (13, 27) (2, 16) (2, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to determine the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {9, 7, 13}
Node 1: {26, 21, 18}
Node 2: {16, 4}
Node 3: {26, 15, 28}
Node 4: {2, 11}
Node 5: {27, 20, 17, 25, 28}
Node 6: {19, 24}
Node 7: {0, 27, 25, 24, 19}
Node 8: {21, 19, 10}
Node 9: {26, 16, 0, 19}
Node 10: {29, 8, 12}
Node 11: {24, 4}
Node 12: {26, 20, 10}
Node 13: {0, 27}
Node 14: {27, 23}
Node 15: {3, 20, 18, 22}
Node 16: {9, 25, 2}
Node 17: {23, 5}
Node 18: {1, 3, 15}
Node 19: {9, 7, 8, 6}
Node 20: {15, 12, 5}
Node 21: {1, 8, 29}
Node 22: {15}
Node 23: {17, 14}
Node 24: {7, 28, 6, 11}
Node 25: {7, 16, 5}
Node 26: {9, 1, 3, 12}
Node 27: {14, 7, 13, 5}
Node 28: {3, 24, 5}
Node 29: {21, 10}

Now, we can identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors:
Nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, 16, 19, 24, 25, 26, and 27 have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: [1 3-star]
<0, (9, 7, 13)>

2. Node 3: [1 3-star]
<3, (26, 15, 28)>

3. Node 5: [1 3-star]
<5, (27, 20, 28)>

4. Node 7: [1 3-star]
<7, (0, 27, 24)>

5. Node 9: [1 3-star]
<9, (26, 16, 19)>

6. Node 12: [1 3-star]
<12, (26, 20, 10)>

7. Node 15: [1 3-star]
<15, (3, 20, 18)>

8. Node 16: [1 3-star]
<16, (9, 25, 2)>

9. Node 19: [1 3-star]
<19, (9, 7, 8)>

10. Node 24: [1 3-star]
<24, (7, 28, 11)>

11. Node 25: [1 3-star]
<25, (16, 5, 27)>

12. Node 26: [1 3-star]
<26, (9, 1, 3)>

13. Node 27: [1 3-star]
<27, (5, 7, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
