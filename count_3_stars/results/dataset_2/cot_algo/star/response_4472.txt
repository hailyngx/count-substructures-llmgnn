Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 20) (13, 24) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 25) (3, 15) (3, 20) (15, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 20) (21, 14) (0, 14) (0, 23) (0, 19) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 16) (19, 0) (19, 26) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 16) (26, 6) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 23) (9, 22) (9, 7) (9, 17) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 27) (17, 9) (17, 18) (20, 13) (20, 3) (20, 21) (8, 27) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 25) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 11) (27, 21) (27, 5) (27, 8) (27, 29) (29, 27) (29, 16) (1, 28) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 4) (25, 22) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 26) (6, 2) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 10) (12, 18) (12, 23) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 12) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 25) (23, 12) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 25) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph provided, we will first determine the neighbors for each node:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {14, 19, 23}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {4, 5, 25, 28}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {6, 7, 10}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {15, 20}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {1, 11, 25, 28}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 22, 27}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {2, 10, 26}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {2, 9}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {27}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {7, 17, 22}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {2, 6, 16, 18}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {4, 24, 25}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {18, 23}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {20, 24}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {0, 16, 21}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {3}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {10, 14, 26, 29}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {9, 18}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {10, 12, 17}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {0, 24, 26}
21. Node 21: Neighbors {14, 20, 27, 28}
22. Node 22: Neighbors {5, 9, 25}
23. Node 23: Neighbors {0, 12, 25, 28}
24. Node 25: Neighbors {1, 4, 11, 23}
25. Node 26: Neighbors {6, 16, 19}
26. Node 27: Neighbors {5, 8, 21, 29}
27. Node 28: Neighbors {1, 21, 23}
28. Node 29: Neighbors {16, 27}

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 21 forms a 3-star with neighbors 20, 27, and 28: <21, (20, 27, 28)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors 4, 25, and 28: <1, (4, 25, 28)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with neighbors 13, 21, and 24: <20, (13, 21, 24)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with neighbors 9, 25, and 5: <22, (9, 5, 25)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with neighbors 0, 16, and 21: <14, (0, 16, 21)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with neighbors 16, 19, and 6: <26, (16, 19, 6)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with neighbors 11, 23, and 4: <25, (11, 23, 4)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 6, 7, and 10: <2, (6, 7, 10)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 8. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
