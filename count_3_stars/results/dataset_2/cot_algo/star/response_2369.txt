Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 12) (12, 17) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 1) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (16, 4) (16, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Neighbors {11, 15}
- Node 1: Neighbors {5, 9, 10, 18}
- Node 2: Neighbors {3, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 15}
- Node 4: Neighbors {10, 16}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 17, 19}
- Node 6: Neighbors {7, 16, 17}
- Node 7: Neighbors {6, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 8: Neighbors {13, 14, 17}
- Node 9: Neighbors {1, 7, 12, 13, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {4, 14, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors {0, 2, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {9, 17}
- Node 13: Neighbors {8, 9, 19}
- Node 14: Neighbors {7, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 15: Neighbors {0, 3}
- Node 16: Neighbors {4, 6}
- Node 17: Neighbors {5, 6, 8, 12}
- Node 18: Neighbors {1, 17}
- Node 19: Neighbors {5, 7, 9, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: Nodes 1, 5, 7, 9, 14, and 17.

For each of these nodes, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 17: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, the final answer (inside brackets) is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 9, 10)>
<1, (5, 9, 18)>
<1, (9, 10, 18)>
<1, (5, 10, 18)>
<5, (1, 9, 10)>
<7, (9, 13, 19)>
<7, (9, 14, 19)>
<7, (13, 14, 19)>
<7, (9, 13, 14)>
<9, (5, 13, 19)>
<9, (7, 13, 19)>
<9, (7, 14, 19)>
<9, (7, 13, 14)>
<9, (5, 7, 19)>
<9, (1, 7, 19)>
<9, (1, 5, 19)>
<14, (7, 10, 11)>
<17, (8, 12, 13)>
<17, (8, 12, 19)>
<17, (8, 13, 19)>
<17, (12, 13, 19)>
