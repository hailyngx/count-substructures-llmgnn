Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {8, 13, 4, 12, 2}
- Node 1: {9, 6, 8, 7}
- Node 2: {9, 13, 12, 6, 7, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 9, 11, 4}
- Node 4: {3, 11, 12, 0, 14}
- Node 5: {11, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {1, 10, 2}
- Node 7: {1, 13, 2}
- Node 8: {1, 13, 0}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 1, 13}
- Node 10: {12, 6, 14}
- Node 11: {5, 3, 14, 4}
- Node 12: {4, 2, 10, 0}
- Node 13: {9, 8, 2, 7, 0}
- Node 14: {5, 11, 4, 10}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 2: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 5: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 10: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 11: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 12: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 13: inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 14: No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].
