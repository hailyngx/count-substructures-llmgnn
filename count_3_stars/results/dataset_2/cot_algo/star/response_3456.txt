Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 0) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 28) (25, 11) (14, 17) (14, 22) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 2) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 23) (20, 24) (20, 11) (2, 17) (2, 23) (2, 15) (8, 1) (21, 28) (21, 19) (21, 26) (21, 24) (28, 25) (28, 21) (28, 13) (22, 14) (22, 29) (26, 17) (26, 21) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 10) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 24) (4, 16) (12, 6) (12, 4) (5, 25) (5, 16) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 16) (7, 3) (7, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 10) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 11) (19, 21) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 29) (27, 10) (27, 29) (29, 22) (29, 19) (29, 27) (29, 18) (24, 17) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 4) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 4) (18, 15) (18, 29) (11, 6) (11, 25) (11, 20) (11, 15) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 11) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are: 
- Node 3 has neighbors: 25, 7, 0, 11 (4 neighbors)
- Node 10 has neighbors: 0, 1, 27, 19, 16 (5 neighbors)
- Node 15 has neighbors: 2, 7, 19, 18, 11 (5 neighbors)
- Node 17 has neighbors: 14, 2, 24, 26, 1 (5 neighbors)
- Node 19 has neighbors: 21, 10, 15, 29 (4 neighbors)
- Node 24 has neighbors: 17, 20, 21, 4 (4 neighbors)
- Node 25 has neighbors: 3, 5, 28, 11 (4 neighbors)
- Node 29 has neighbors: 22, 19, 27, 18 (4 neighbors)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 15 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 17 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 
\[ 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 34 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (25, 7, 0)>
- <10, (0, 1, 27)>
- <15, (2, 7, 19)>
- <17, (14, 2, 24)>
- <17, (14, 2, 26)>
- <17, (14, 2, 1)>
- <17, (14, 24, 26)>
- <17, (14, 24, 1)>
- <17, (14, 26, 1)>
- <19, (21, 10, 15)>
- <24, (17, 20, 21)>
- <25, (3, 5, 28)>
- <29, (22, 19, 27)>
- <29, (22, 19, 18)>
- <29, (22, 27, 18)>
- <29, (19, 27, 18)>
