Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 16) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 19) (2, 1) (2, 12) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (6, 4) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 8) (13, 12) (13, 9) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:

1: (14, 2, 7, 8)
2: (1, 12)
3: (15, 10, 5, 14)
4: (12, 5, 6)
5: (3, 4, 8, 0)
6: (4)
7: (1, 18, 8)
8: (11, 1, 16, 5, 7)
9: (18, 13, 0)
10: (3, 14)
11: (19, 8)
12: (4, 2, 13, 18, 19)
13: (12, 9)
14: (3, 17, 1, 19, 10)
15: (3, 16)
16: (15, 8, 19)
17: (14)
18: (12, 9, 7)
19: (14, 11, 16, 12)

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node with 3 or more neighbors:

1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
12: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 38 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [38].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 8, 7)>
<1, (7, 2, 8)>
