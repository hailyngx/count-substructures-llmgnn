Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 16) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 15) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 13) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 12) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 19) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 10) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 12) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (19, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 18) (10, 16) (10, 9) (4, 13) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (14, 8, 13)
- Node 1: 2 neighbors (15, 18)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (16, 6, 7)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (8, 7)
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (13, 3)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (13, 12, 16)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (14, 2, 15)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (2, 3)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 11, 17, 3)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (18, 10)
- Node 10: 2 neighbors (16, 9)
- Node 11: 2 neighbors (8, 6)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (5, 15, 18)
- Node 13: 5 neighbors (0, 5, 17, 4, 15)
- Node 14: 3 neighbors (0, 6, 18)
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (1, 13, 6, 12)
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (2, 5, 18, 10)
- Node 17: 2 neighbors (8, 13)
- Node 18: 5 neighbors (14, 1, 16, 9, 12)
- Node 19: 1 neighbor (7)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars by applying the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, 8, 11, 17>
<5, 13, 4, 15>
<13, 17, 15, 4>
<18, 16, 10, 9>
<16, 18, 12, 5>
<0, 14, 6, 15>
<13, 0, 5, 17>
<18, 14, 6, 2>
<8, 0, 13, 5>
<15, 1, 18, 12>
