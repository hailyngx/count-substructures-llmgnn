Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 11) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 11, 13}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 8, 14}
- Node 2: {1, 10, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 10}
- Node 4: {0, 3, 6, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 9, 12}
- Node 6: {3, 4, 7, 14}
- Node 7: {6, 9, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {1, 9, 13}
- Node 9: {5, 7, 8}
- Node 10: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 11: {0, 4, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 13: {0, 2, 4, 8, 11}
- Node 14: {1, 6, 7}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1, 3, 4, 7, 13 each have 5 neighbors.
- Node 5, 9 have 3 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- For nodes with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars each
- For nodes with 3 neighbors: Only 1 3-star each

Total 3-stars = \( 10 * 5 + 1 * 2 = 52 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [52].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (2, 8, 14)>
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 11, 13)>
- <7, (6, 9, 14)>
- <13, (0, 8, 11)>
