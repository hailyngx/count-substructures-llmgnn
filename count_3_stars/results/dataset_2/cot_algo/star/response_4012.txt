Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 24) (29, 28) (29, 0) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 21) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 10) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 20) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 24) (21, 11) (21, 27) (21, 22) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (25, 15) (16, 28) (16, 19) (16, 27) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 29) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 24) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 23) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 8) (15, 24) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 22) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 22) (8, 15) (8, 14) (22, 6) (22, 21) (22, 20) (22, 14) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 17) (13, 18) (13, 20) (13, 4) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 0) (24, 15) (12, 6) (12, 18) (12, 5) (4, 13) (23, 3) (23, 17) (17, 27) (17, 23) (17, 19) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 17) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {29, 5, 3, 24}
- Node 1: Neighbors = {10, 26}
- Node 2: Neighbors = {9, 18, 10, 24}
- Node 3: Neighbors = {0, 14, 23}
- Node 4: Neighbors = {13}
- Node 5: Neighbors = {26, 12, 0}
- Node 6: Neighbors = {9, 22, 12, 19}
- Node 7: Neighbors = {10, 11, 14}
- Node 8: Neighbors = {15, 14}
- Node 9: Neighbors = {6, 2, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors = {2, 7, 1}
- Node 11: Neighbors = {9, 7, 21}
- Node 12: Neighbors = {6, 18, 5}
- Node 13: Neighbors = {18, 20, 4}
- Node 14: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 22}
- Node 15: Neighbors = {26, 8, 24, 25}
- Node 16: Neighbors = {28, 19, 27}
- Node 17: Neighbors = {27, 19, 23}
- Node 18: Neighbors = {2, 12, 13}
- Node 19: Neighbors = {6, 16, 17}
- Node 20: Neighbors = {26, 13, 22}
- Node 21: Neighbors = {11, 27, 22}
- Node 22: Neighbors = {6, 14, 20, 21}
- Node 23: Neighbors = {3, 17}
- Node 24: Neighbors = {2, 28, 0, 15}
- Node 25: Neighbors = {15}
- Node 26: Neighbors = {1, 5, 20, 15}
- Node 27: Neighbors = {21, 16, 17}
- Node 28: Neighbors = {29, 24, 16}
- Node 29: Neighbors = {28, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 22, 19} <6, (9, 22, 19)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes {9, 18, 24} <2, (9, 18, 24)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 22, 8} <14, (7, 22, 8)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes {21, 16, 17} <27, (21, 16, 17)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes {26, 13, 22} <20, (26, 13, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
