Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
The nodes have the following degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. 
These 3-stars involve the following sets of nodes:
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
These 3-stars involve the following sets of nodes:
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
These 3-stars involve the following sets of nodes:
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 6, 3)>
<8, (1, 7, 3)>
<8, (2, 6, 3)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 3, 7)>
<8, (6, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 7)>

Adding up all the 3-stars that can be formed, we get a total of 40 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [40].
