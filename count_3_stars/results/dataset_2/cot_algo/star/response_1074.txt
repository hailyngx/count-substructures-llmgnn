Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 20) (16, 2) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 25) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 3) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 5) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 26) (20, 23) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 15) (24, 6) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 15) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 23) (27, 24) (27, 25) (27, 28) (18, 26) (18, 1) (29, 20) (29, 8) (29, 3) (10, 16) (10, 21) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 10) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 14) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 14) (12, 25) (12, 28) (12, 14) (8, 29) (28, 4) (28, 27) (28, 12) (17, 6) (17, 0) (3, 9) (3, 29) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 3) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 1) (15, 5) (15, 24) (19, 24) (19, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {20, 17, 5}
- Node 1: {7, 18, 2, 19}
- Node 2: {16, 13, 1}
- Node 3: {9, 29, 14}
- Node 4: {7, 28, 21}
- Node 5: {22, 6, 0, 15}
- Node 6: {5, 24, 17}
- Node 7: {4, 1}
- Node 8: {29}
- Node 9: {22, 14, 3}
- Node 10: {16, 21}
- Node 11: {20}
- Node 12: {25, 28, 14}
- Node 13: {22, 21, 2}
- Node 14: {9, 25, 23, 12, 3}
- Node 15: {5, 24}
- Node 16: {2, 10}
- Node 17: {6, 0}
- Node 18: {26, 1}
- Node 19: {24, 1}
- Node 20: {11, 0, 29, 26, 23}
- Node 21: {13, 4, 10}
- Node 22: {13, 9, 5, 25}
- Node 23: {20, 26, 14}
- Node 24: {6, 26, 27, 19, 15}
- Node 25: {22, 27, 12, 14}
- Node 26: {20, 24, 18, 23}
- Node 27: {24, 25, 28}
- Node 28: {4, 27, 12}
- Node 29: {20, 8, 3}

Now, we will identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. These are the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:

\[ \text{Total number of 3-stars} = \binom{24}{3} = 2024 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2024].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, 20, 29>
- <1, 2, 13>
- <1, 2, 16>
- <1, 4, 21>
- <1, 19, 24>
- <2, 13, 21>
- <3, 9, 14>
- <5, 15, 24>
- <5, 22, 25>
- <9, 14, 23>
- <12, 14, 25>
- <14, 25, 27>
- <20, 23, 26>
- <24, 26, 27>
