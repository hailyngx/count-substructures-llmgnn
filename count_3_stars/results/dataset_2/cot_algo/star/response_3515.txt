Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 20) (17, 16) (17, 19) (3, 9) (3, 29) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 21) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 20) (7, 23) (15, 4) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 21) (20, 14) (20, 7) (20, 15) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (19, 17) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 23) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (9, 12) (10, 29) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 11) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 5) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 1) (23, 0) (11, 2) (11, 21) (11, 18) (18, 9) (18, 24) (18, 11) (5, 25) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 22) (1, 16) (1, 23) (1, 0) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 23) (0, 1) (0, 12) (27, 19) (27, 9) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (22, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine the neighbor set for each node. 

Node 0: {1, 12, 13, 23, 24}
Node 1: {0, 16, 23}
Node 2: {5, 11, 25}
Node 3: {4, 9, 19, 29}
Node 4: {3, 5, 15, 25, 29}
Node 5: {2, 22, 24, 25}
Node 6: {12, 20, 28}
Node 7: {15, 20, 23}
Node 8: {9, 13, 15, 21, 26}
Node 9: {3, 8, 12, 18, 27, 29}
Node 10: {29}
Node 11: {2, 18, 21}
Node 12: {0, 6, 9}
Node 13: {0, 8}
Node 15: {4, 7, 8, 20, 21, 26}
Node 16: {1, 17, 28}
Node 17: {16, 19}
Node 18: {9, 11, 24}
Node 19: {3, 17, 26, 27, 29}
Node 20: {6, 7, 14, 15}
Node 21: {8, 11, 15}
Node 22: {5}
Node 23: {0, 1, 7, 26}
Node 24: {0, 5, 18}
Node 25: {2, 4, 5, 15, 26}
Node 26: {5, 8, 15, 19, 23, 25}
Node 27: {9, 19}
Node 28: {6, 16}
Node 29: {3, 4, 9, 10, 19}

Next, we identify nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 19 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 26 has 6 neighbors, so it can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 111

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [111].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 12>, <0, 1, 13>, <0, 1, 23>, <0, 1, 24>, <0, 12, 13>, <0, 12, 23>, <0, 12, 24>, <0, 13, 23>, <0, 13, 24>, <0, 23, 24>, <3, 4, 5>, <3, 4, 15>, <3, 4, 25>, <3, 4, 29>, <3, 5, 15>, <3, 5, 25>, <3, 9, 12>, <3, 9, 18>, <3, 9, 27>, <3, 9, 29>, <4, 5, 15>, <4, 5, 25>, <4, 5, 29>, <4, 15, 25>, <4, 15, 26>, <4, 15, 29>, <5, 22, 24>, <5, 22, 25>, <5, 23, 24>, <5, 24, 18>, <5, 25, 26>, <5, 25, 26>, <8, 9, 12>, <8, 9, 13>, <8, 9, 15>, <8, 9, 21>, <8, 9, 26>, <8...
