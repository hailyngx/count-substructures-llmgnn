Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 15) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 19) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 11) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 14) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 0) (1, 2) (1, 14) (17, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 16) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 5) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 3) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {9, 2, 5, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 14}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 18}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 9, 11, 16}
- Node 4: Neighbors {7, 19, 3}
- Node 5: Neighbors {17, 0, 15, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {15, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 12, 8, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 19, 11}
- Node 9: Neighbors {3, 0, 19}
- Node 10: Neighbors {11}
- Node 11: Neighbors {8, 3, 10, 15}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 16, 14, 0}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 6}
- Node 14: Neighbors {18, 5, 12, 1}
- Node 15: Neighbors {6, 11, 5}
- Node 16: Neighbors {18, 12, 3}
- Node 17: Neighbors {5}
- Node 18: Neighbors {2, 16, 14}
- Node 19: Neighbors {4, 9, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, 3-stars: [inom{4}{3}] = [4]
<0, (2, 5, 12)>
<0, (2, 5, 14)>
<0, (5, 12, 14)>
<0, (2, 12, 14)>
- Node 2, 3-stars: [0]
- Node 5, 3-stars: [0]
- Node 12, 3-stars: [0]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
