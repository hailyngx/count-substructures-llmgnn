Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we'll first construct the adjacency list for each node:

- Node 0: {5, 9, 13, 7, 6}
- Node 1: {11, 4}
- Node 2: {3, 13, 12, 4}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 2}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 11, 14}
- Node 5: {9, 8, 0, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {3, 8, 0, 7}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 11, 6, 14}
- Node 8: {5, 13, 10, 6, 12}
- Node 9: {5, 14, 10, 7, 0}
- Node 10: {9, 8, 12}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 12, 4}
- Node 12: {8, 2, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {8, 2, 0}
- Node 14: {5, 9, 7, 4}

Now, for each node that has three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- For Node 0, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For Node 2, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- For Node 4, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- For Node 5, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For Node 6, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For Node 7, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For Node 8, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For Node 9, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For Node 12, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- For Node 13, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- For Node 14, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars formed is 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 67. 

Therefore, the final answer is [67], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, 7, 9>
- <0, 7, 11>
- <0, 7, 14>
- <0, 9, 10>
- <0, 9, 14>
- <0, 13, 8>
- <0, 13, 9>
- <0, 6, 3>
- <0, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 8>
- <2, 12, 11>
- <2, 12, 8>
- <2, 12, 10>
- <2, 4, 1>
- <2, 4, 11>
- <2, 4, 14>
- <4, 2, 11>
- <4, 2, 14>
- <4, 11, 7>
- <4, 11, 12>
- <4, 11, 2>
- <5, 14, 7>
