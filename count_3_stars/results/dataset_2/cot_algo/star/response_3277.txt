Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 15) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 20) (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 26) (7, 22) (20, 21) (20, 25) (25, 9) (25, 20) (25, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 24) (10, 23) (10, 29) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 10) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 28) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 17) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 22) (4, 19) (4, 24) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (24, 26) (24, 10) (24, 4) (24, 0) (18, 5) (18, 17) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 17) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 16) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 27) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 19) (29, 10) (29, 27) (6, 10) (6, 0) (27, 28) (27, 29) (27, 13) (13, 2) (13, 27) (13, 19) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 17) (5, 18) (17, 23) (17, 18) (17, 2) (17, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {25, 14, 24, 6}
- Node 1: {21, 11, 28, 8}
- Node 2: {3, 14, 12, 13, 17}
- Node 3: {2}
- Node 4: {8, 23, 22, 19, 24}
- Node 5: {18}
- Node 6: {10, 0}
- Node 7: {22}
- Node 8: {1, 23, 4, 28}
- Node 9: {25, 15}
- Node 10: {11, 6, 24, 23, 29}
- Node 11: {26, 1, 10}
- Node 12: {22, 2, 16}
- Node 13: {2, 27, 19}
- Node 14: {0, 2, 16}
- Node 15: {9, 26}
- Node 16: {14, 12, 19}
- Node 17: {23, 18, 2, 19}
- Node 18: {5, 17}
- Node 19: {4, 16, 13, 17}
- Node 20: {21, 25}
- Node 21: {1, 20}
- Node 22: {7, 4, 12}
- Node 23: {10, 8, 4, 17}
- Node 24: {26, 10, 4, 0}
- Node 25: {9, 20, 0}
- Node 26: {24, 15, 11}
- Node 27: {28, 29, 13}
- Node 28: {1, 8, 27}
- Node 29: {10, 27}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2, Node 4, Node 17, and Node 23 have 5 neighbors.
- Node 1, Node 8, Node 10, and Node 19 have 4 neighbors.
- Node 0, Node 21, and Node 14 have 4 neighbors.

Next, let's calculate how many 3-stars are formed using the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 23: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: There is only 1 3-star with Node 1.
- Node 8: There is only 1 3-star with Node 8.
- Node 10: There is only 1 3-star with Node 10.
- Node 19: There is only 1 3-star with Node 19.
- Node 0: There are no 3-stars with Node 0.
- Node 21: There are no 3-stars with Node 21.
- Node 14: There are no 3-stars with Node 14.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 44 \). 

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us the answer: [44].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (12, 13, 16)>
- <2, (12, 13, 17)>
- <2, (12, 16, 17)>
- <2, (13, 16, 17)>
- <4, (12, 19, 22)>
- <4, (12, 19, 24)>
- <4, (12, 22, 24)>
- <4, (19, 22, 24)>
- <17, (4, 19, 23)>
- <17, (4, 19, 17)>
- <17, (4, 23, 17)>
- <17, (19, 23, 17)>
- <23, (4, 17, 23)>
- <23, (4, 17, 8)>
- <23, (4, 23, 8)>
- <23, (17, 8, 23)>

- <28, (1, 8, 27)>
- <2, (14, 16, 17)>
- <3, (2, 12, 13)>
- <3, (2, 12, 16)>
- <5, (17, 18, 19)>
