Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 17) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Edges: 
- Node 0: {3, 11, 14}
- Node 1: {3, 15}
- Node 2: {9, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 11, 18, 19}
- Node 4: {9, 10, 18}
- Node 5: {9, 10, 16}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 17}
- Node 7: {6, 13}
- Node 8: {6, 16, 19}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 13}
- Node 10: {4, 5, 19}
- Node 11: {0, 3}
- Node 12: {13}
- Node 13: {7, 9, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 13}
- Node 15: {1, 2}
- Node 16: {5, 8, 17}
- Node 17: {2, 6, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 19: {3, 8, 10, 17}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 11, 18, 19
    - Number of 3-stars from node 3 = inom{5}{3} = 10
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 9, 10, 18
    - Number of 3-stars from node 4 = 1
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 9, 10, 16
    - Number of 3-stars from node 5 = 1
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 6, 16, 19
    - Number of 3-stars from node 8 = 1
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 13
    - Number of 3-stars from node 9 = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors: 7, 9, 12, 14
    - Number of 3-stars from node 13 = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 16, 19
    - Number of 3-stars from node 17 = inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 4
    - Number of 3-stars from node 18 = 1
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 3, 8, 10, 17
    - Number of 3-stars from node 19 = inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [30], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (0, 1, 18)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <13, (7, 9, 12)>, <17, (2, 6, 16)>, <19, (3, 8, 10)>
