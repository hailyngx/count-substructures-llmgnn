Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: {2, 4, 9, 13}
Node 1: {2, 4, 10, 12}
Node 2: {0, 1, 3, 7, 8}
Node 3: {2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14}
Node 4: {0, 1, 5, 8, 9}
Node 5: {4, 6, 7}
Node 6: {3, 5, 9, 13}
Node 7: {2, 5}
Node 8: {2, 4, 8, 11, 13}
Node 9: {0, 3, 4, 6, 13}
Node 10: {1, 3, 11, 12}
Node 11: {2, 3, 8, 10, 14}
Node 12: {1, 10}
Node 13: {0, 6, 8, 9}
Node 14: {3, 11}

Based on the above information, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<3, (6, 9, 13)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<11, (2, 8, 10)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
