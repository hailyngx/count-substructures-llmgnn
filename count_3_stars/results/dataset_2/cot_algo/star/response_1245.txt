Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 4}
- Node 1: {6, 12}
- Node 2: {0, 4, 7, 9, 13}
- Node 3: {0, 7, 11, 12, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 9, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 5, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {2, 3, 4, 9}
- Node 8: {6, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 9: {2, 4, 5, 7}
- Node 10: {12, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 8, 12, 14}
- Node 12: {1, 3, 10, 11}
- Node 13: {2, 3, 6, 8, 10}
- Node 14: {4, 6, 8, 10, 11}

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2, 4, 7, 9, 13, and 14 have 5 neighbor nodes, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.
- Node 0, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 11 have 4 neighbor nodes, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars for each of these nodes.
- Node 12 has 3 neighbor nodes, so there is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star for this node.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\(10 \times 6 + 4 \times 6 + 1 = 60 + 24 + 1 = 85\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [85].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <4, (2, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <13, (2, 6, 8)>
- <14, (4, 8, 11)>
- <0, (2, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 7, 13)>
- <6, (1, 8, 13)>
- <8, (6, 11, 14)>
- <10, (12, 13, 14)>
- <11, (8, 12, 14)>
- <12, (1, 3, 10)>
