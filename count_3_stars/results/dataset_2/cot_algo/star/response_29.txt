Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {5, 6, 9, 10, 14}
- Node 1: Neighbors {3, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {5, 6}
- Node 3: Neighbors {1, 4, 6, 11, 13}
- Node 4: Neighbors {3, 7, 10, 13}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 3, 9, 13}
- Node 7: Neighbors {4, 8, 10, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {7, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 13}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 1, 4, 7, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 3, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 8, 10, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 14: Neighbors {0, 11, 12}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star formations for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up these counts gives us a total of 70 3-star formations. 

Therefore, the final answer is [70], and the unique 3-star formations are:

<0, 5, 9>
<0, 5, 6>
<0, 5, 13>
<0, 5, 14>
