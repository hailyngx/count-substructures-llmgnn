Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: {10, 14, 2, 12}
Node 1: {4, 8}
Node 2: {6, 4, 0, 14}
Node 3: {6, 9, 7, 13}
Node 4: {7, 8, 2, 1, 14}
Node 5: {6, 12}
Node 6: {9, 5, 10, 3, 2, 12}
Node 7: {4, 11, 3, 13}
Node 8: {9, 4, 10, 1, 12}
Node 9: {6, 8, 3}
Node 10: {6, 11, 0, 8}
Node 11: {7, 10, 14, 12}
Node 12: {6, 11, 8, 5, 0}
Node 13: {7, 3, 14}
Node 14: {4, 11, 0, 2, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 5 neighbors so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the final answer is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (9, 5, 12)>, <6, (9, 10, 3)>, <6, (5, 10, 12)>, <6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (10, 3, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 14)>, <4, (7, 1, 14)>, <4, (8, 2, 14)>, <4, (2, 1, 14)>, <12, (11, 8, 5)>, <12, (11, 5, 0)>, <12, (11, 8, 0)>, <12, (8, 5, 0)>, <12, (11, 14, 0)>, <14, (11, 2, 13)>.
