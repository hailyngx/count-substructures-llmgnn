Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's find the total number of 3-stars formed.

First, let's list the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {1, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 3, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 3: {1, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 5, 7, 8}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (can form 10 3-stars)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (cannot form 3-stars)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (can form 10 3-stars)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (can form 10 3-stars)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (cannot form 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30, which is represented as [30].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
