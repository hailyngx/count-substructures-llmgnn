Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 13, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 12}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 8, 10, 11, 13}
- Node 4: {0, 9, 12}
- Node 5: {7, 10, 12, 13}
- Node 6: {9, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 10}
- Node 8: {3, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 10: {3, 5, 7, 11, 14}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 12: {1, 4, 5, 8, 11, 14}
- Node 13: {0, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 14: {6, 8, 10, 12}

Based on the neighbor sets, we can see that the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, and 14.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 82 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [82].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 7>
- <0, 3, 13>
- <0, 4, 12>
- <0, 5, 7>
- <3, 7, 8>
- <3, 7, 10>
- <3, 10, 11>
- <3, 10, 13>
- <3, 11, 12>
- <5, 7, 10>
- <5, 10, 12>
- <7, 9, 10>
- <7, 9, 12>
- <7, 10, 12>
- <10, 11, 12>
- <12, 14, 10>
