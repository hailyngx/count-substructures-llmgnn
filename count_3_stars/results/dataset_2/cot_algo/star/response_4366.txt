Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) 

Response:
First, let's organize the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {3, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5: {3, 4, 8}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 4, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 4, 7, 8}

Next, we can identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 7 forms two 3-stars: <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4, so the answer is [4].
