Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's start by listing the neighbor nodes for each node:

- Node 0: 5, 6, 4, 8
- Node 1: 9, 3, 2, 7
- Node 2: 9, 1, 3, 7
- Node 3: 5, 6, 1, 4, 2
- Node 4: 9, 6, 3, 0
- Node 5: 0, 3, 7
- Node 6: 9, 3, 4, 8, 0
- Node 7: 5, 1, 2
- Node 8: 9, 6, 0
- Node 9: 6, 8, 4, 2, 1

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, and then calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes.

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 5, 7
  - Number of 3-stars for node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Number of 3-stars for node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 = 2, which we represent as [2]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
