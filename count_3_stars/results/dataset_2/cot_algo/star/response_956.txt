Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 15) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 3) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now, let's calculate the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {3, 9, 14, 18}
Node 1: {6, 13}
Node 2: {3, 15, 16}
Node 3: {0, 4, 9, 11, 2}
Node 4: {3, 5, 15, 19}
Node 5: {4, 7, 12, 19}
Node 6: {1, 12, 13}
Node 7: {5, 8, 10, 17}
Node 8: {7}
Node 9: {0, 3, 11, 15}
Node 10: {7}
Node 11: {3, 9, 17}
Node 12: {5, 6, 16}
Node 13: {1, 6}
Node 14: {0, 18, 19}
Node 15: {2, 4, 9}
Node 16: {2, 12, 17}
Node 17: {7, 11, 16}
Node 18: {0, 14}
Node 19: {4, 5, 14}

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
Nodes with 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 5, 9, 15, 19}

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars:

For nodes with 4 neighbors:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 7. 
Thus, the final answer is [7].

List of unique 3-stars:
<4, (3, 9, 15)>
<5, (4, 7, 12)>
<9, (0, 11, 15)>
<15, (2, 9, 15)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<19, (4, 5, 14)>
<0, (3, 9, 14)>
