Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {10, 11, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {11, 6, 2, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {11, 8, 5, 1, 0}
- Node 3: {4, 7, 5, 0, 14}
- Node 4: {14, 3}
- Node 5: {8, 13, 2, 3, 14}
- Node 6: {7, 10, 1}
- Node 7: {3, 6, 13}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 12}
- Node 9: {13}
- Node 10: {11, 0, 6, 12, 14}
- Node 11: {10, 1, 0, 2}
- Node 12: {10, 8, 13, 1}
- Node 13: {7, 5, 12, 1, 9}
- Node 14: {4, 10, 5, 1, 3}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 5, Node 10, Node 12, and Node 13 have 4 or more neighbors. 
- Node 4 and Node 14 have exactly 2 neighbors, so they cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form a 3-star.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

\( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} \)

\( = 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 78 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [78].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (10, 11, 2)>, <0, (10, 2, 3)>, <0, (11, 2, 3)>, <0, (11, 2, 5)>, <1, (10, 12, 13)>, <1, (10, 12, 14)>, <1, (10, 13, 14)>, <1, (12, 13, 14)>, <2, (10, 11, 1)>, <3, (4, 5, 14)>, <5, (8, 13, 14)>, <10, (11, 12, 14)>, <10, (11, 13, 14)>, <10, (12, 13, 14)>, <10, (1, 12, 13)>.
