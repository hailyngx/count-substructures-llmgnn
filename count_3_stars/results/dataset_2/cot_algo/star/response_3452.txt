- Node 2: {0, 11, 21, 22, 28}
- Node 3: {6, 19, 20}
- Node 4: {1, 7, 15, 16, 28}
- Node 5: {11, 20, 23, 29}
- Node 6: {3, 15, 24, 26}
- Node 7: {4, 9, 16}
- Node 8: {18, 21}
- Node 9: {7, 9, 18, 19}
- Node 10: {27}
- Node 11: {2, 5, 13, 16, 29}
- Node 12: {0, 19, 14}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {12}
- Node 15: {4, 6}
- Node 16: {4, 7, 11}
- Node 17: {18, 19, 24, 27}
- Node 18: {8, 9, 17, 23}
- Node 19: {3, 9, 12, 17}
- Node 20: {1, 3, 5, 26}
- Node 21: {0, 2, 8, 21, 25}
- Node 22: {2}
- Node 23: {5, 18}
- Node 24: {6, 17, 26}
- Node 25: {21, 26, 29}
- Node 26: {6, 20, 24, 25}
- Node 27: {10, 17}
- Node 28: {2, 4}
- Node 29: {5, 11, 25}

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed around each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 24: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 25: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 26: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 27: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 28: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 29: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 53

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [53].
