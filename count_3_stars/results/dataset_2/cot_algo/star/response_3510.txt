Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 15) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 15) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 14) (6, 11) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 15) (16, 3) (16, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 17) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (18, 8) (18, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 10) 

Response:
First, we will create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {4, 11, 15, 19}
- Node 1: {3, 10, 13}
- Node 2: {3, 12, 15}
- Node 3: {1, 2, 14, 16}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 13}
- Node 5: {8, 12}
- Node 6: {11, 14}
- Node 7: {4, 11, 12, 15}
- Node 8: {5, 18}
- Node 9: {17, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 13, 19}
- Node 11: {0, 6, 7, 12}
- Node 12: {2, 5, 7, 11, 18}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 10}
- Node 14: {3, 6}
- Node 15: {0, 2, 7, 17}
- Node 16: {3, 17}
- Node 17: {9, 15, 16}
- Node 18: {8, 12}
- Node 19: {0, 9, 10}

Next, we will identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they are involved in:

- Node 0, Node 7, and Node 12 have 4 neighbors, thus each can form 4 3-stars:
    - <0, (4, 11, 15), 19>
    - <7, (4, 11, 12), 15>
    - <12, (2, 7, 11), 18>
- Node 1, Node 3, and Node 13 have 3 neighbors, thus each can form 1 3-star:
    - <1, (3, 10, 13)>
    - <3, (1, 2, 14)>
    - <13, (1, 4, 10)>
- Node 2, Node 15, and Node 17 have 4 neighbors, thus each can form 4 3-stars:
    - <2, (3, 12, 15), 17>
    - <15, (0, 7, 17), 2>
    - <17, (9, 15, 16), 2>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
