Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 14) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 16) (13, 17) (4, 6) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 15) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 19) (11, 2) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 3) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 19) (10, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first list the neighborhoods for each node:
- Node 0: {17, 8, 5}
- Node 1: {8, 12, 19, 10}
- Node 2: {8, 16, 3, 11}
- Node 3: {9, 2, 8, 19}
- Node 4: {6, 12}
- Node 5: {14, 15, 0, 16}
- Node 6: {17, 7, 4}
- Node 7: {6}
- Node 8: {2, 0, 12, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {3}
- Node 10: {1}
- Node 11: {2, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 4, 18, 1}
- Node 13: {17}
- Node 14: {17, 18, 15, 5}
- Node 15: {14, 5, 16}
- Node 16: {2, 5, 18, 15}
- Node 17: {6, 14, 13, 0}
- Node 18: {14, 12, 16}
- Node 19: {1, 11, 3}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Form 1 3-star
- Node 2: Form 1 3-star
- Node 3: Form 1 3-star
- Node 5: Form 1 3-star
- Node 8: Form 1 3-star
- Node 12: Form 1 3-star
- Node 14: Form 1 3-star
- Node 16: Form 1 3-star
- Node 17: Form 3 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 17, 8>, <2, 8, 3>, <3, 19, 1>, <5, 14, 15>, <8, 12, 1>, <12, 18, 14>, <16, 18, 5>, <17, 6, 14>, <17, 13, 0>, <17, 14, 0>, <17, 14, 15>
