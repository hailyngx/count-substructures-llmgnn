Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 22 and 24.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 16.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 14, 19, 24, 25.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 27.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 4, 13, 28.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 5, 12, 20, 27.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 17, 25, 29.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 7, 21, 22.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 8, 15, 16.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 11, 19.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 10, 25, 27.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 11, 17, 19, 20.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 12, 15.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 13, 16, 17.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 14, 18.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 15, 27.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 13, 16, 24.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 6, 11, 13, 17.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 14, 18, 22, 27.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 11, 19.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 20, 29.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 7, 21, 22, 28.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 18, 21, 22.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 24, 26.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 16, 23, 24.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 10, 25, 29.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 23, 26, 29.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 15, 18, 27.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 4, 21, 28.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 6, 20, 25, 26, 29.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 27 has 5 neighbors: nodes 3, 10, 15, 18, 27. So, the number of 3-stars from node 27 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 22 has 5 neighbors: nodes 0, 7, 18, 21, 22. So, the number of 3-stars from node 22 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 29 has 5 neighbors: nodes 6, 20, 25, 26, 29. So, the number of 3-stars from node 29 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors: nodes 2, 9, 14, 19, 24, 25. So, the number of 3-stars from node 2 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Node 16 has 5 neighbors: nodes 1, 8, 13, 16, 24. So, the number of 3-stars from node 16 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Adding these up, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 60 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [60]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<2, (2, 9, 14)>, <2, (2, 19, 24)>, <2, (2, 25, 9)>, <2, (2, 25, 14)>, <16, (16, 1, 13)>, <16, (16, 1, 4)>, <16, (16, 8, 1)>, <16, (16, 13, 4)>, <16, (16, 13, 17)>, <27, (27, 3, 10)>, <27, (27, 3, 15)>, <27, (27, 3, 18)>, <27, (27, 3, 27)>, <27, (27, 10, 15)>, <27, (27, 10, 18)>, <27, (27, 10, 27)>, <27, (27, 15, 18)>, <27, (27, 15, 27)>, <27, (27, 18, 27)>, <22, (22, 0, 7)>, <22, (22, 0, 18)>, <22, (22, 0, 21)>, <22, (22, 0, 22)>, <22, (22, 7, 18)>, <22, (22, 7, 21)>, <22, (22, 7, 22)>, <22, (22, 18, 21)>, <22, (22, 18, 22)>, <22, (22, 21, 28)>, <29, (29, 6, 20)>, <29, (29, 6, 25)>, <29, (29, 6, 26)>, <29, (29, 6, 29)>, <29, (29, 20, 25)>, <29, (29, 20, 26)>, <29, (29, 20, 29)>, <29, (29, 25, 26)>, <29, (29, 25, 29)>, <29, (29, 26, 29)>
