Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 6) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: {10, 14, 6, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 2, 9}
- Node 2: {8, 5, 1, 3}
- Node 3: {8, 9, 2}
- Node 4: {8, 9, 1, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 14, 13, 7}
- Node 6: {10, 4, 0, 14, 7}
- Node 7: {10, 5, 13, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 2, 12, 3}
- Node 9: {11, 4, 14, 12, 1, 3}
- Node 10: {0, 6, 7}
- Node 11: {9}
- Node 12: {8, 0, 14, 13, 9}
- Node 13: {14, 5, 12, 7}
- Node 14: {0, 6, 9, 12, 13, 5}

By observation, nodes 0, 4, 6, 9, and 14 have 4 or more neighbors, thus potentially forming 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of unique 3-stars formed:

- Node 0: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = [4]
  - <0, 10, 6, 14>
  - <0, 10, 6, 12>
  - <0, 10, 14, 12>
  - <0, 6, 14, 12>

- Node 4: [\( \binom{4}{3} \)] = [4]
  - <4, 8, 9, 1>
  - <4, 8, 9, 6>
  - <4, 8, 1, 6>
  - <4, 9, 1, 6>

- Node 6: [\( \binom{5}{3} \)] = [10]
  - <6, 10, 4, 0>
  - <6, 10, 14, 0>
  - <6, 10, 14, 7>
  - <6, 4, 0, 14>
  - <6, 4, 10, 14>
  - <6, 4, 9, 14>
  - <6, 0, 14, 7>
  - <6, 14, 0, 12>
  - <6, 14, 13, 5>
  - <6, 14, 12, 13>

- Node 9: [\( \binom{6}{3} \)] = [20]
  - <9, 11, 4, 14>
  - <9, 11, 14, 12>
  - <9, 11, 12, 1>
  - <9, 11, 12, 3>
  - <9, 4, 14, 12>
  - <9, 4, 14, 1>
  - <9, 4, 12, 1>
  - <9, 4, 12, 3>
  - <9, 14, 12, 13>
  - <9, 14, 12, 1>
  - <9, 14, 13, 5>
  - <9, 14, 5, 13>
  - <9, 12, 13, 5>
  - <9, 12, 13, 7>
  - <9, 12, 13, 6>
  - <9, 12, 5, 13>
  - <9, 12, 5, 7>
  - <9, 12, 5, 6>
  - <9, 13, 5, 7>
  - <9, 1, 12, 3>

- Node 14: [\( \binom{6}{3} \)] = [20]
  - <14, 13, 5, 12>
  - <14, 13, 5, 7>
  - <14, 13, 5, 6>
  - <14, 13, 12, 5>
  - <14, 13, 12, 7>
  - <14, 13, 12, 9>
  - <14, 13, 7, 5>
  - <14, 13, 7, 6>
  - <14, 13, 7, 9>
  - <14, 5, 12, 9>
  - <14, 5, 12, 7>
  - <14, 5, 12, 3>
  - <14, 5, 7, 6>
  - <14, 5, 7, 9>
  - <14, 5, 7, 3>
  - <14, 12, 7, 9>
  - <14, 12, 7, 3>
  - <14, 12, 7, 6>
  - <14, 7, 5, 9>
  - <14, 7, 5, 6>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20] = [58].
