Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 9) (27, 13) (27, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 5) (3, 8) (7, 21) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 17) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 11) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 25) (11, 10) (11, 29) (11, 20) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 26) (28, 9) (29, 11) (29, 20) (29, 14) (13, 27) (13, 26) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 18) (26, 13) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 19) (20, 23) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 14) (12, 17) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 23) (22, 4) (22, 5) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 16) (14, 29) (14, 4) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 16) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 16) (24, 7) (24, 13) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 28) (9, 17) (17, 21) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 9) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 23) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first determine the neighbors of each node. 

Here are the neighbors for each node:
- Node 1 neighbors: {6, 18}
- Node 2 neighbors: {15, 18, 19}
- Node 3 neighbors: {5, 6, 8, 25, 26}
- Node 4 neighbors: {14, 22, 23}
- Node 5 neighbors: {3, 16, 22}
- Node 6 neighbors: {1, 3, 23, 25}
- Node 7 neighbors: {21, 24}
- Node 8 neighbors: {3, 14}
- Node 9 neighbors: {10, 17, 27, 28}
- Node 10 neighbors: {9, 11, 18}
- Node 11 neighbors: {10, 20, 25, 29}
- Node 12 neighbors: {17}
- Node 13 neighbors: {19, 24, 26, 27}
- Node 14 neighbors: {4, 8, 29}
- Node 15 neighbors: {2, 23, 27}
- Node 16 neighbors: {5, 16, 19, 23, 27}
- Node 17 neighbors: {9, 12, 19, 21}
- Node 18 neighbors: {1, 2, 10, 26}
- Node 19 neighbors: {2, 13, 16, 17, 20}
- Node 20 neighbors: {11, 19, 23, 29}
- Node 21 neighbors: {7, 17}
- Node 22 neighbors: {4, 5}
- Node 23 neighbors: {4, 6, 15, 16, 20}
- Node 24 neighbors: {7, 13}
- Node 25 neighbors: {3, 6, 11}
- Node 26 neighbors: {3, 13, 18}
- Node 27 neighbors: {15, 16, 27}
- Node 28 neighbors: {9}
- Node 29 neighbors: {11, 14, 20}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 15: 1 3-star
- Node 16: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star
- Node 20: 1 3-star
- Node 23: 1 3-star
- Node 27: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <15, 23, 27>
- <16, 19, 27>
- <19, 20, 23>
- <20, 23, 27>
