Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: 7, 12, 5, 14, 10
- Node 1: 7, 2, 11, 13
- Node 2: 1, 13, 10
- Node 3: 4, 8, 10, 13
- Node 4: 8, 9, 3
- Node 5: 6, 11, 0, 14
- Node 6: 12, 5, 14, 10, 13
- Node 7: 12, 0, 11, 1
- Node 8: 4, 9, 3
- Node 9: 4, 8, 14, 10
- Node 10: 2, 6, 0, 9, 3
- Node 11: 7, 12, 5, 1
- Node 12: 7, 0, 6, 11
- Node 13: 2, 6, 1, 3
- Node 14: 5, 6, 0, 9

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 14, 10)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 8, 10)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes (5, 14, 0) and (12, 5, 11)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes (4, 8, 14)

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars found in the graph, so the final answer is [6].
