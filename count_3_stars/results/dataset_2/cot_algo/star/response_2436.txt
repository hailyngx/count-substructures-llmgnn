Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 27) (8, 13) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 28) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 11) (20, 10) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 23) (7, 22) (12, 7) (12, 1) (1, 12) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 23) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 6) (28, 18) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 25) (24, 21) (17, 9) (17, 22) (21, 20) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 19) (2, 22) (2, 19) (22, 7) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 15) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 10) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 18) (16, 27) (15, 22) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 29) (15, 11) (19, 21) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (18, 28) (18, 23) (18, 15) (18, 25) (18, 3) (3, 5) (3, 20) (3, 18) (10, 20) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 27) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 15) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 10) (29, 8) (29, 15) (25, 24) (25, 18) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: {20, 7, 28}
- Node 1: {12}
- Node 2: {22, 19}
- Node 3: {5, 20, 18}
- Node 5: {9, 11, 3}
- Node 6: {28, 21}
- Node 7: {0, 12, 23, 22}
- Node 8: {13, 29}
- Node 9: {5, 17, 27}
- Node 10: {20, 14, 19, 27}
- Node 11: {5, 13, 20, 15}
- Node 12: {7, 1}
- Node 13: {8, 11, 14}
- Node 14: {13, 24, 10}
- Node 15: {22, 19, 18, 29, 11}
- Node 16: {27}
- Node 17: {9, 22}
- Node 18: {28, 23, 15, 25, 3}
- Node 19: {21, 2, 15, 10}
- Node 20: {0, 21, 3, 11, 10}
- Node 21: {20, 6, 24, 19}
- Node 22: {7, 17, 2, 15}
- Node 23: {7, 26, 18}
- Node 24: {26, 14, 25, 21}
- Node 25: {24, 18}
- Node 26: {24, 28, 23}
- Node 27: {9, 16, 10}
- Node 28: {0, 26, 6, 18}
- Node 29: {8, 15}

Now let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to 3 neighbors: (20, 7, 28), so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (20, 7, 28)>
- Node 3 is connected to 3 neighbors: (5, 20, 18), so it forms 1 3-star: <3, (5, 20, 18)>
- Node 7 is connected to 4 neighbors: (0, 12, 23, 22), so it forms 1 3-star: <7, (0, 12, 23)>
- Node 10 is connected to 4 neighbors: (20, 14, 19, 27), so it forms 1 3-star: <10, (20, 14, 19)>
- Node 11 is connected to 4 neighbors: (5, 13, 20, 15), so it forms 1 3-star: <11, (5, 13, 20)>
- Node 15 is connected to 5 neighbors: (22, 19, 18, 29, 11), so it forms 1 3-star: <15, (22, 19, 18)>
- Node 18 is connected to 5 neighbors: (28, 23, 15, 25, 3), so it forms 1 3-star: <18, (28, 23, 15)>
- Node 19 is connected to 4 neighbors: (21, 2, 15, 10), so it forms 1 3-star: <19, (21, 2, 15)>
- Node 20 is connected to 5 neighbors: (0, 21, 3, 11, 10), so it forms 1 3-star: <20, (0, 21, 11)>
- Node 21 is connected to 4 neighbors: (20, 6, 24, 19), so it forms 1 3-star: <21, (20, 6, 24)>
- Node 22 is connected to 4 neighbors: (7, 17, 2, 15), so it forms 1 3-star: <22, (7, 17, 2)>
- Node 24 is connected to 4 neighbors: (26, 14, 25, 21), so it forms 1 3-star: <24, (26, 14, 25)>
- Node 28 is connected to 4 neighbors: (0, 26, 6, 18), so it forms 1 3-star: <28, (0, 26, 6)>
- Node 29 is connected to 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

Total number of 3-stars = 13, so the final answer is [13].
