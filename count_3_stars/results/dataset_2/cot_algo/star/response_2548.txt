Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we will first identify the neighbor set for each node:

Node 0: {3, 5, 8, 9}
Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 12, 13}
Node 2: {1, 10}
Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 7}
Node 4: {3, 5, 11, 14}
Node 5: {0, 1, 4, 9, 10}
Node 6: {8, 9, 10, 13}
Node 7: {3, 9, 12}
Node 8: {0, 6, 10, 14}
Node 9: {0, 5, 6, 7, 12, 14}
Node 10: {2, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14}
Node 11: {4, 12}
Node 12: {1, 7, 9, 11}
Node 13: {1, 6, 10}
Node 14: {4, 8, 9, 10}

Now, we will check the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 5: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get: 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 5> 
<0, 5, 9> 
<0, 5, 10> 
<0, 8, 10> 
<1, 3, 5> 
<1, 5, 12> 
<1, 5, 13> 
<1, 12, 9> 
<1, 13, 10> 
<3, 4, 7> 
<3, 7, 9> 
<4, 5, 9> 
<4, 5, 14> 
<5, 9, 14> 
<6, 8, 10>
