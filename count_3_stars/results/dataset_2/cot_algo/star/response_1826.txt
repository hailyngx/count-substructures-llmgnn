Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 13) (21, 7) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 17) (4, 8) (4, 28) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 2) (19, 26) (19, 13) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 23) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 5) (5, 26) (5, 20) (5, 23) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 25) (25, 16) (25, 6) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 10) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 15) (9, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 22) (11, 6) (2, 26) (2, 6) (23, 17) (23, 5) (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 22) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (24, 0) (24, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 24) (22, 10) (22, 3) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 24) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 27) (27, 20) (27, 28) (27, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 24) (10, 22) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node based on the given edges:

1: 26, 20, 13
2: 26, 6
3: 16, 22, 27
4: 8, 28
5: 26, 20, 23
6: 25, 11, 2, 22
7: 21, 11, 17
8: 4, 28, 14, 11
9: 0
10: 0, 14, 24, 22
11: 7, 8, 18, 6, 22
13: 1, 19, 0, 18
14: 8, 26, 10
15: 28, 18, 24
16: 0, 3, 25
17: 7, 20, 23
18: 8, 11, 13, 15, 24
19: 26, 13
20: 1, 17, 27, 5
21: 7
22: 11, 6, 24, 10, 3
23: 17, 5
24: 0, 22, 10, 15
25: 16, 6
26: 1, 19, 5, 14, 2
27: 20, 28, 3
28: 4, 8, 27, 15

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 9
- Node 21
- Node 23

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

Node 9 does not form any 3-star.
Node 21 does not form any 3-star.
Node 23 does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
