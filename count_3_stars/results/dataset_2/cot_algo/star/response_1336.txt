Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 6) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 19) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 15) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (15, 19) (15, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 17) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 14) (16, 5) 

Response:
Considering the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we will first list the neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: {5, 10}
- Node 2: {3, 6, 11}
- Node 3: {2, 4, 5, 17}
- Node 4: {3, 7, 12, 14}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 16}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 12, 13}
- Node 7: {4, 10, 12, 18}
- Node 8: {6, 14, 17}
- Node 9: {12, 13, 17}
- Node 10: {1, 7, 11, 19}
- Node 11: {2, 10, 18}
- Node 12: {4, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 13: {6, 9, 14, 15}
- Node 14: {4, 8, 13}
- Node 15: {13, 19}
- Node 16: {5}
- Node 17: {3, 8, 9}
- Node 18: {7, 11, 19}
- Node 19: {10, 15, 18}

Next, we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <3, (2, 4, 17)>
- <4, (3, 7, 12)>
- <6, (2, 12, 13)>
- <7, (4, 10, 12)>
- <8, (6, 14, 17)>
- <9, (12, 13, 17)>
- <10, (1, 11, 19)>
- <11, (2, 18, 10)>
- <12, (4, 6, 7)>
- <13, (6, 9, 14)>
- <14, (4, 13, 8)>
- <17, (3, 8, 9)>
- <18, (11, 7, 19)>
- <19, (10, 15, 18)>
