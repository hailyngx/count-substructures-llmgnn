Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 4, 10}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 6, 8, 11}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 3, 7, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {2, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {0, 10, 13, 14}
- Node 5: Neighbors {8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {2, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 10, 11}
- Node 10: Neighbors {0, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 11: Neighbors {1, 9, 12, 13, 14}
- Node 12: Neighbors {7, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 13: Neighbors {4, 11, 12}
- Node 14: Neighbors {4, 11}

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 11, 14
- Nodes with more than 3 neighbors: 8, 10

Calculations for nodes with more than 3 neighbors:
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Calculations for nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 1 3-star

Total 3-stars = 20 (from node 8) + 10 (from node 10) + 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 11) + 1 (from node 14) = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 10>
- <0, 2, 4>
- <0, 4, 10>
- <0, 4, 14>
- <4, 11, 13>
- <4, 11, 14>
- <8, 10, 12>
- <8, 10, 3>
- <8, 12, 11>
- <8, 12, 3>
- <8, 12, 8>
- <8, 3, 6>
- <8, 3, 8>
- <8, 3, 9>
- <8, 6, 1>
- <8, 6, 3>
