Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 26) (9, 24) (9, 20) (9, 1) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 0) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 28) (23, 19) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 3) (27, 24) (27, 8) (15, 22) (15, 10) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 8) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 21) (19, 23) (19, 0) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 17) (21, 0) (21, 14) (21, 3) (28, 23) (28, 16) (28, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 29) (13, 5) (13, 7) (17, 12) (17, 20) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 7) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 25) (16, 2) (3, 12) (3, 21) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 26) (10, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 29) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 16) (1, 29) (1, 25) (29, 5) (29, 7) (29, 1) (8, 27) (8, 20) (24, 9) (24, 27) (25, 26) (25, 5) (25, 16) (25, 1) (25, 2) (2, 6) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 25) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {22, 17, 21, 19} -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {9, 28, 16, 29, 25} -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {6, 16, 3, 25} -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: {12, 21, 2} -> 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: {13, 17, 11, 29} -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: {15, 14, 26, 4} -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 12 has 3 neighbors: {22, 17, 3} -> 1 3-star
- Node 13 has 2 neighbors: {5, 7} -> 0 3-stars
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: {28, 1, 25, 2} -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 17 has 5 neighbors: {12, 20, 0, 26, 7} -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 20 has 3 neighbors: {9, 17, 8} -> 1 3-star
- Node 21 has 3 neighbors: {0, 14, 3} -> 1 3-star
- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: {23, 15, 0, 12} -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 25 has 5 neighbors: {26, 5, 16, 1, 2} -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: {6, 10, 25, 17} -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: {5, 7, 1} -> 1 3-star

Summing up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 44 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [44].
