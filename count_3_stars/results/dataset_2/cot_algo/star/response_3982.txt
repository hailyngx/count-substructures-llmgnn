Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 17) (9, 2) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 14) (15, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (18, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 6) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 2) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 13) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 6, 8, 13, 14, 17

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars formed with each of these central nodes:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 17 has 6 neighbors, so it forms \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding all these up: 
\[ 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 72 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [72].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, 4, 8>
- <0, 6, 13>
- <0, 6, 19>
- <0, 13, 6>
- <4, 8, 14>
- <4, 8, 18>
- <6, 13, 0>
- <14, 8, 4>
- <14, 11, 2>
- <17, 5, 12>
- <17, 5, 10>
- <17, 10, 6>
- <17, 10, 11>
- <17, 10, 19>
- <17, 11, 2>
- <17, 11, 14>
