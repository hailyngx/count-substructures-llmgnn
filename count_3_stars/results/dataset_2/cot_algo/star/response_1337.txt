Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 15) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 4) (8, 19) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 1) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 17) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 10) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Let's list the neighbors for each node:

Node 0: {10, 18, 5}
Node 1: {10, 13, 15, 4, 19}
Node 2: {8, 12, 4}
Node 3: {16, 18, 17}
Node 4: {8, 1, 2}
Node 5: {0, 9}
Node 6: {10, 13, 14, 18}
Node 7: {8, 14}
Node 8: {2, 19, 4, 7}
Node 9: {5}
Node 10: {0, 6, 1}
Node 11: {16}
Node 12: {15, 2, 14}
Node 13: {1, 19, 6}
Node 14: {12, 15, 6, 7}
Node 15: {12, 1, 14}
Node 16: {3, 17, 11}
Node 17: {16, 18, 3}
Node 18: {0, 3, 6, 17}
Node 19: {8, 1, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0, Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 4, Node 6, Node 8, Node 10, Node 12, Node 13, Node 14, Node 15, Node 16, Node 17, Node 18, Node 19

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes participate in:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 12: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 13: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 15: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 16: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 17: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 18: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 19: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 32

Therefore, the final answer is [32].

All unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
