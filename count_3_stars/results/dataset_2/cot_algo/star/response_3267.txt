Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 5, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 3: Neighbors {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {5, 8}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 2, 7}
- Node 7: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 1, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 3, 5, 7}

Next, we identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 6 neighbors, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars formed is 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 49.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 1, 5>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 3, 5>
<0, 4, 5>
<0, 5, 8>
<0, 5, 9>
<1, 5, 8>
<2, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7>
<3, 5, 9>
<3, 7, 9>
<4, 5, 8>
<5, 8, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [49].
