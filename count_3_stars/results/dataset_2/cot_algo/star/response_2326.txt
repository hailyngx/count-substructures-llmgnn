Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 25) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 23) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 21) (23, 27) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 26) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 27) (9, 3) (9, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (24, 9) (24, 15) (26, 0) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 12) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 7) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 17) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 27) (25, 10) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 19) (21, 10) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 27) (21, 4) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 18) (5, 2) (5, 28) (6, 14) (6, 19) (17, 18) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 4) (15, 16) (15, 24) (15, 7) (27, 23) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 21) (29, 0) (28, 5) (28, 14) (28, 4) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 14) (4, 28) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 6) (12, 23) (12, 26) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, we will first determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {20, 25, 26, 29}
- Node 1: {3, 20, 22}
- Node 2: {5, 14}
- Node 3: {1, 9, 19}
- Node 4: {13, 14, 21, 28}
- Node 5: {2, 18, 28}
- Node 6: {14, 19}
- Node 7: {13, 15, 27}
- Node 8: {10, 11, 23, 25}
- Node 9: {3, 24}
- Node 10: {8, 21, 25}
- Node 11: {8, 16}
- Node 12: {23, 26}
- Node 13: {4, 7, 26}
- Node 14: {2, 4, 6, 28}
- Node 15: {7, 16, 24}
- Node 16: {11, 15, 18}
- Node 17: {18}
- Node 18: {5, 16, 17, 26}
- Node 19: {3, 6, 25}
- Node 20: {0, 1, 27}
- Node 21: {4, 21, 22, 27}
- Node 22: {1, 21}
- Node 23: {8, 12, 21, 27}
- Node 24: {9, 15}
- Node 25: {0, 8, 10, 19}
- Node 26: {0, 12, 13, 18}
- Node 27: {7, 20, 21, 27}
- Node 28: {4, 5, 14, 28}
- Node 29: {0}

Next, we identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and can form 3-stars:

- Nodes with 3 neighbors: None
- Nodes with 4 neighbors: Nodes 8 and 21
- Nodes with 5 neighbors: Nodes 4, 5, and 14

We will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form:

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 21: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 38 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [38]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <8, (10, 23, 25)>
- <21, (4, 22, 27)>
- <4, (14, 5, 28)>
- <5, (2, 18, 28)>
- <14, (2, 4, 28)>
