Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbor nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3

Next, we'll check which nodes have 3 or more neighbors to form 3-stars:
- Node 0, Node 3, and Node 4 each have 5 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.
- Node 1, Node 2, Node 5, and Node 7 each have 4 neighbors, so they can form 3-stars.

For nodes with 5 neighbors:
1. Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
2. Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
3. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

For nodes with 4 neighbors:
1. Node 1: Only 1 3-star
2. Node 2: Only 1 3-star
3. Node 5: Only 1 3-star
4. Node 7: Only 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 2, 3)>
