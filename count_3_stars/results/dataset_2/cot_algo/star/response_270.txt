Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, we will determine the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 6}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 6}
- Node 9: {4, 5, 6}

Now, let's check which nodes have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0, 5 choose 3 = 10
- Node 2, 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 4, 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 5, 6 choose 3 = 20
- Node 6, 4 choose 3 = 4
- Node 8, 4 choose 3 = 4

Adding these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
