Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (5, 6) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 2) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {2, 4, 14}
- Node 1: {8, 11, 13, 14}
- Node 2: {0, 3, 11, 12}
- Node 3: {2, 9, 10}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 13, 14}
- Node 5: {6, 11}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9, 10, 11}
- Node 7: {4, 6, 9, 11}
- Node 8: {1, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 9: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 10: {3, 6, 8, 13, 14}
- Node 11: {1, 2, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 12: {2, 8, 13}
- Node 13: {1, 4, 10, 12, 14}
- Node 14: {0, 1, 4, 8, 10, 13}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: forms a 3-star with leaves (2, 4, 14)
- Node 1: forms a 3-star with leaves (8, 13, 14)
- Node 2: forms a 3-star with leaves (11, 12, 2)
- Node 4: forms a 3-star with leaves (13, 14, 4)
- Node 6: forms a 3-star with leaves (9, 10, 6)
- Node 7: forms a 3-star with leaves (9, 11, 7)
- Node 10: forms a 3-star with leaves (13, 14, 10)
- Node 13: forms a 3-star with leaves (12, 14, 13)
- Node 14: forms a 3-star with leaves (8, 10, 14)

Counting these unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, 0, 14>, <8, 1, 13>, <11, 12, 2>, <13, 14, 4>, <9, 10, 6>, <9, 11, 7>, <13, 14, 10>, <12, 14, 13>, <8, 10, 14>.
