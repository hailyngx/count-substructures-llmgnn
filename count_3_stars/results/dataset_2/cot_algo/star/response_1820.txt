Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 12) (26, 19) (26, 15) (26, 3) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 19) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 0) (20, 25) (20, 11) (12, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 1) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 2) (0, 3) (0, 25) (0, 4) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 29) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 21) (8, 7) (17, 29) (17, 7) (29, 4) (29, 17) (29, 23) (18, 27) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 13) (19, 26) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 23) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 15) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 1) (24, 6) (24, 18) (24, 5) (11, 20) (11, 7) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 23) (15, 2) (14, 7) (14, 21) (22, 10) (22, 21) (23, 29) (23, 19) (23, 1) (23, 15) (2, 27) (2, 11) (2, 15) (21, 9) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 22) (13, 18) (10, 22) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: Neighbors {3, 4, 25}
2. Node 1: Neighbors {5, 12, 16, 23}
3. Node 2: Neighbors {11, 15, 27}
4. Node 3: Neighbors {0, 8, 25, 26}
5. Node 4: Neighbors {0, 8, 18, 29}
6. Node 5: Neighbors {1, 6, 12, 15, 24}
7. Node 6: Neighbors {5, 9, 15, 19, 24}
8. Node 7: Neighbors {8, 11, 14, 17}
9. Node 8: Neighbors {0, 3, 4, 7, 19, 21}
10. Node 9: Neighbors {6, 12, 21}
11. Node 10: Neighbors {22}
12. Node 11: Neighbors {2, 7, 20}
13. Node 12: Neighbors {1, 5, 9, 27}
14. Node 13: Neighbors {18}
15. Node 14: Neighbors {7, 21}
16. Node 15: Neighbors {2, 5, 6, 15, 23, 26}
17. Node 16: Neighbors {1}
18. Node 17: Neighbors {7, 29}
19. Node 18: Neighbors {4, 13, 24, 27}
20. Node 19: Neighbors {6, 8, 15, 23, 26}
21. Node 20: Neighbors {11, 25}
22. Node 21: Neighbors {6, 8, 9, 14, 22}
23. Node 23: Neighbors {1, 15, 19, 21, 29}
24. Node 24: Neighbors {5, 6, 18}
25. Node 25: Neighbors {0, 3, 20}
26. Node 26: Neighbors {3, 15, 19}
27. Node 27: Neighbors {2, 12, 18}
28. Node 29: Neighbors {4, 17, 23}
29. Node 29: Neighbors {4, 17, 23}

Now, we can identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

- Node 0, 3, 8, 19, 25, and 26 can each form a 3-star.
- Node 4, 6, 15, 18, 21, 23 can form multiple 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
6 nodes can form 1 3-star each, while 6 nodes can each form more than 1 3-star. 

So, the total number of 3-stars is [6 + 6 = 12].

Unique 3-stars:
