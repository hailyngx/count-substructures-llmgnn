Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 15) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 7) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 18) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 10) (18, 16) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 17) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 8) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 12) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {4, 5, 10, 16}
- Node 1: {14, 19}
- Node 2: {17}
- Node 3: {8, 11}
- Node 4: {0, 10, 15}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 19}
- Node 6: {9, 15}
- Node 7: {8, 9, 14}
- Node 8: {3, 5, 7, 10, 17}
- Node 9: {6, 7, 14, 17}
- Node 10: {0, 4, 8}
- Node 11: {3, 19}
- Node 12: {13, 16, 17, 19}
- Node 13: {12}
- Node 14: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 15: {4, 6, 16}
- Node 16: {0, 12, 15, 17, 18}
- Node 17: {2, 8, 9, 12, 16}
- Node 18: {16}
- Node 19: {1, 5, 11, 12}

Now, let's identify which nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 10, and 15: <4, (0, 10, 15)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 19: <5, (0, 8, 19)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 17: <8, (3, 7, 17)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 17, and 19: <12, (16, 17, 19)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 12, and 15: <16, (0, 12, 15)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 12, and 16: <17, (8, 12, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is [6].
