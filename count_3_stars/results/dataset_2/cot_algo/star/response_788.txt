Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 22) (16, 20) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 13) (2, 22) (2, 12) (18, 17) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 29) (9, 22) (9, 4) (22, 16) (22, 2) (22, 9) (22, 5) (1, 15) (1, 28) (1, 13) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 6) (13, 23) (13, 1) (13, 12) (17, 18) (17, 3) (21, 27) (21, 5) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 28) (4, 3) (12, 16) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 3) (19, 8) (19, 29) (19, 27) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 25) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 29) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 28) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 25) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 20) (27, 26) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 20) (26, 27) (26, 29) (29, 14) (29, 19) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 26) (5, 0) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 20) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 27) (20, 24) (20, 5) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we first need to identify the neighbors of each node:

Node 0: {28, 24, 5}
Node 1: {15, 28, 13}
Node 2: {22, 12}
Node 3: {17, 4, 12, 29}
Node 4: {9, 12, 28, 3}
Node 5: {0, 22, 21, 20}
Node 6: {14, 10, 25}
Node 8: {23, 19}
Node 9: {22, 4}
Node 10: {15, 6}
Node 11: {16}
Node 12: {16, 2, 13, 4, 3}
Node 13: {23, 1, 12}
Node 14: {6, 20, 29}
Node 15: {23, 1, 10}
Node 16: {11, 12, 22, 20}
Node 17: {18, 3}
Node 18: {17}
Node 19: {8, 29, 27}
Node 20: {16, 14, 27, 24, 5}
Node 21: {27, 5}
Node 22: {16, 2, 9, 5}
Node 23: {8, 15, 24, 13}
Node 24: {23, 0, 20}
Node 25: {6, 29, 28}
Node 26: {27, 29}
Node 27: {21, 19, 20, 26}
Node 28: {0, 1, 4, 25}
Node 29: {14, 19, 3, 25, 26}

Now we'll identify the nodes that can form a 3-star:

Node 0: None (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 1: None (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 2: none (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 3: <4, (12, 4, 29)>
Node 4: None (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 5: <22, (20, 16, 21)>
Node 6: None (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 8: None (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 9: None (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 10: None (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 11: None (has only 1 neighbor)
Node 12: <16, (3, 13, 4)>
Node 13: <23, (1, 12, 23)>
Node 14: None (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 15: None (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 16: <12, (20, 22, 14)>
Node 17: None (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 18: None (has only 1 neighbor)
Node 19: None (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 20: <27, (16, 24, 14)>
Node 21: None (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 22: <5, (16, 2, 21)>
Node 23: None (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 24: None (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 25: None (has only 3 neighbors)
Node 26: None (has only 2 neighbors)
Node 27: None (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 28: None (has only 4 neighbors)
Node 29: None (has only 5 neighbors)

Counting the total number of 3-stars found, we have 7 in total. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
