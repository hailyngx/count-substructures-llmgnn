Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 16) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 2) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (15, 11) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 1) (16, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 9, 3, 15
- Node 1: 13, 10, 19, 12
- Node 2: 9, 10, 18, 4
- Node 3: 8, 7, 0, 12
- Node 4: 6, 17, 2, 14
- Node 5: 14
- Node 6: 4, 14, 16
- Node 7: 9, 3
- Node 8: 13, 3
- Node 9: 2, 14, 7, 0
- Node 10: 17, 1, 2
- Node 11: 17, 19, 15
- Node 12: 13, 18, 3, 1
- Node 13: 8, 12, 1, 14
- Node 14: 6, 9, 13, 5
- Node 15: 11, 0
- Node 16: 6
- Node 17: 10, 11, 4
- Node 18: 2, 19, 12
- Node 19: 18, 11, 1

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 10: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 12: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 13: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 14: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

So, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 9, 14>, <1, 12, 13>, <2, 4, 9>, <3, 8, 12>, <4, 6, 14>, <9, 14, 13>, <10, 1, 17>, <12, 18, 13>.
