Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 11) (20, 15) (20, 9) (20, 24) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 0) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 24) (29, 17) (29, 3) (22, 27) (22, 16) (26, 28) (26, 16) (13, 15) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 14) (13, 7) (21, 10) (21, 2) (3, 29) (3, 7) (3, 10) (28, 17) (28, 26) (28, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 25) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 8) (16, 0) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 18) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 21) (2, 28) (2, 19) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 19) (19, 2) (19, 1) (27, 22) (27, 24) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 12) (24, 20) (24, 17) (24, 27) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 11) (12, 25) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (23, 1) 

Response:
First, let's create an adjacency list based on the given edges:

1: [11, 7, 19]
2: [5, 21, 28, 19]
3: [29, 7, 10]
4: [15, 6, 0, 14]
5: [6, 13, 2, 18]
6: [5, 18, 4, 0]
7: [13, 3, 1]
8: [9, 16]
9: [20, 8, 10]
10: [21, 3, 9, 25]
11: [15, 14, 1, 18]
12: [25]
13: [15, 5, 25, 14, 7]
14: [13, 11, 4]
15: [20, 13, 4, 11]
16: [22, 26, 8, 0]
17: [29, 28, 24]
18: [5, 6, 11]
19: [2, 1]
20: [15, 9, 24]
21: [10, 2]
22: [27, 16]
23: [1]
24: [17, 27, 20]
25: [13, 10, 12]
26: [28, 16]
27: [22, 24]
28: [17, 26, 2]
29: [17, 3]

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 15 has 4 neighbors: 20, 13, 4, 11 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 6, 13, 2, 18 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 5, 18, 4, 0 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 13 has 5 neighbors: 15, 5, 25, 14, 7 -> [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 29, 7, 10 -> 1 3-star
Node 17 has 3 neighbors: 29, 28, 24 -> 1 3-star
Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 22, 26, 8, 0 -> [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 28

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<15, (20, 13, 4)>
<5, (6, 13, 2)>
<6, (5, 18, 4)>
<13, (15, 5, 25)>
<3, (29, 7, 10)>
<17, (29, 28, 24)>
<16, (22, 26, 8)>
