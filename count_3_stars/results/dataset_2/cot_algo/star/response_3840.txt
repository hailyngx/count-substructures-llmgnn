Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (0, 7) (0, 15) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 19) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 2) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 3) (1, 5) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 19) (16, 17) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0: {7, 15}
- Node 1: {5}
- Node 2: {5, 13, 14}
- Node 3: {8, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 4: {11, 18}
- Node 5: {1, 2, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {0, 13, 15}
- Node 8: {3, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 9: {3, 5, 10, 13, 19}
- Node 10: {2, 8, 12, 9}
- Node 11: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 12: {8, 10, 14}
- Node 13: {2, 7, 9, 17}
- Node 14: {2, 3, 12}
- Node 15: {0, 7, 17}
- Node 16: {17}
- Node 17: {13, 15, 16, 19}
- Node 18: {4, 19}
- Node 19: {3, 9, 17, 18}

Nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 0 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 10: 1 3-star
- Node 11: 1 3-star
- Node 13: 1 3-star
- Node 14: 0 3-star
- Node 15: 0 3-star
- Node 17: 1 3-star
- Node 19: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10

Therefore, the final answer is [10].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<2, 9, 19>
<3, 5, 9>
<5, 1, 11>
<7, 13, 15>
<8, 10, 12>
<9, 3, 19>
<10, 2, 8>
<11, 4, 8>
<13, 2, 17>
<17, 15, 19>
