Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 23) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 11) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 17) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 5) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 24) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 15) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 10) (20, 21) (20, 29) (29, 7) (29, 20) (29, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 27) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 16) (11, 21) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 6) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 24) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 6) (5, 22) (5, 3) (5, 12) (8, 3) (14, 1) (14, 22) (0, 15) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 24) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 19) (10, 12) (10, 13) (24, 25) (24, 15) (24, 12) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 19) (23, 1) (23, 27) (27, 16) (27, 23) (27, 9) (9, 27) 

Response:
First, we need to determine the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 1: 4 neighbors (21, 14, 23, 4)
- Node 21: 4 neighbors (1, 16, 20, 11)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (1, 7, 2)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (4, 11, 29, 3, 10)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (22, 2, 6, 12)
- Node 22: 4 neighbors (18, 14, 5, 17)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (7, 25, 28, 5, 8)
- Node 25: 3 neighbors (3, 17, 24)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (4, 18, 15)
- Node 28: 3 neighbors (3, 17, 10)
- Node 20: 2 neighbors (21, 29)
- Node 29: 3 neighbors (7, 20, 11)
- Node 16: 3 neighbors (21, 17, 27)
- Node 17: 5 neighbors (22, 25, 28, 16, 11)
- Node 11: 4 neighbors (21, 7, 29, 6)
- Node 15: 4 neighbors (2, 19, 0, 24)
- Node 19: 3 neighbors (15, 10, 6)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (22, 3, 12)
- Node 8: 1 neighbor (3)
- Node 14: 2 neighbors (1, 22)
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (15)
- Node 12: 4 neighbors (18, 5, 10, 24)
- Node 13: 1 neighbor (10)
- Node 10: 5 neighbors (7, 28, 19, 12, 13)
- Node 24: 3 neighbors (25, 15, 12)
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (18, 11, 19)
- Node 23: 2 neighbors (1, 27)
- Node 27: 3 neighbors (16, 23, 9)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (27)

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {4, 11, 29} <7, (4, 11, 29)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {7, 28, 12} <10, (7, 28, 12)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {18, 5, 10} <12, (18, 5, 10)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {22, 25, 28} <17, (22, 25, 28)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 16, 20} <21, (1, 16, 20)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {18, 5, 17} <22, (18, 5, 17)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 27, 9} <23, (1, 27, 9)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {15, 12, 25} <24, (15, 12, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 7, and the final answer is [7].
