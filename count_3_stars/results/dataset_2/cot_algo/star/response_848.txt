Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 1, 6, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 5
Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 7
Node 3: 2, 7, 8
Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 6, 8
Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 8, 9
Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 9
Node 8: 3, 4, 6
Node 9: 0, 5, 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star formations:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star formations.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-star formations: <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-star formations: <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 5, 9)>.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star formations.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-star formations: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>.
Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-star formations: <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 6, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 0)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 7, 0)>.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are [inom{5}{3}] = [10] 3-star formations: <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 0)>, <6, (9, 0, 7)>, <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (9, 7, 5)>, <6, (9, 7, 3)>.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-star formations: <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 0)>, <7, (9, 5, 6)>.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there are [inom{3}{3}] = [1] 3-star formations.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so there are [inom{4}{3}] = [4] 3-star formations: <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 3)>.

Summing up all the 3-star formations, we get a total of [45] 3-stars.
