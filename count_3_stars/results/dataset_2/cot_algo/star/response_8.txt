Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the neighbor nodes for each node:

Node 0 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 11
Node 1 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 13, 14
Node 2 neighbors: 0, 1, 9, 11, 13
Node 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 8, 9, 10
Node 5 neighbors: 0, 8, 13
Node 6 neighbors: 3, 6, 13, 14
Node 7 neighbors: 4, 9, 10, 11, 14
Node 8 neighbors: 1, 4, 5
Node 9 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7
Node 10 neighbors: 4, 7, 11
Node 11 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 10, 13
Node 12 neighbors: 14
Node 13 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 11
Node 14 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 12

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 11: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 13: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 58 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [58].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:
<4, (3, 9, 10)>
<7, (4, 9, 14)>
<1, (3, 13, 14)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<11, (0, 2, 7)>
<13, (1, 5, 11)>
