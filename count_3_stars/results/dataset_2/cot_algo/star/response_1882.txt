Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 25) (22, 23) (22, 24) (22, 7) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 24) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 6) (29, 24) (29, 21) (1, 23) (1, 19) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 8) (23, 10) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 16) (4, 25) (4, 11) (4, 20) (0, 7) (0, 21) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 19) (25, 13) (25, 4) (25, 10) (9, 8) (9, 21) (17, 13) (17, 24) (17, 12) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 16) (28, 27) (28, 5) (28, 20) (26, 18) (21, 29) (21, 0) (21, 9) (10, 15) (10, 23) (10, 8) (10, 25) (14, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 27) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 5) (20, 4) (20, 28) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 29) (6, 8) (27, 28) (27, 19) (24, 22) (24, 15) (24, 29) (24, 17) (24, 5) (5, 28) (5, 11) (5, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {7, 21}
- Node 1: {19, 23}
- Node 2: {6, 11, 18, 29}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 10, 15}
- Node 4: {11, 20, 25}
- Node 5: {11, 24, 28}
- Node 6: {2, 8, 15, 29}
- Node 7: {0, 19, 22}
- Node 8: {3, 6, 9, 10, 15, 23}
- Node 9: {8, 21}
- Node 10: {8, 15, 23, 25}
- Node 11: {2, 4, 5}
- Node 12: {13, 17}
- Node 13: {12, 17, 25}
- Node 14: {16}
- Node 15: {3, 6, 10, 24}
- Node 16: {14, 18, 28}
- Node 17: {12, 13, 24}
- Node 18: {2, 16, 26}
- Node 19: {1, 7, 27}
- Node 20: {4, 28}
- Node 21: {0, 9, 29}
- Node 22: {7, 23, 24}
- Node 23: {1, 8, 10, 22}
- Node 24: {5, 15, 17, 22, 29}
- Node 25: {4, 10, 13}
- Node 26: {18}
- Node 27: {19, 28}
- Node 28: {5, 16, 20, 27}
- Node 29: {2, 6, 21, 24}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, 3, 6, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, and 28 each have 4 or more neighbors, so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them: 

\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 2} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 3} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 6} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 8} = \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 15} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 16} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 17} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 18} = \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 23} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 24} = \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
\( \text{Number of 3-stars for node 28} = \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Summing up these results: 
\( 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 53 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [53].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, 6, 11>
- <3, 6, 8>
- <8, 15, 23>
- <15, 24, 29>
- <17, 22, 24>
- <18, 16, 28>
