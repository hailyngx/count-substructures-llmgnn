Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's analyze the neighbors of each node:

- Node 0 has neighbors: {3, 4, 6, 8, 7}
- Node 1 has neighbors: {5, 4, 8}
- Node 2 has neighbors: {9, 8, 7}
- Node 3 has neighbors: {0, 6, 4}
- Node 4 has neighbors: {9, 1, 3, 0, 6}
- Node 5 has neighbors: {9, 1, 7}
- Node 6 has neighbors: {3, 4, 8, 0}
- Node 7 has neighbors: {5, 9, 2, 0}
- Node 8 has neighbors: {9, 1, 2, 0, 6}
- Node 9 has neighbors: {5, 8, 4, 2, 7}

Based on the neighbors of each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:

- <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Since each of these nodes has exactly 3 neighbors forming a unique 3-star, there are 7 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [7].
