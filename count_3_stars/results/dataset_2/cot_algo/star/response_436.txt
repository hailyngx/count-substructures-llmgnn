Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's denote the nodes as follows: Node 0, Node 1, ..., Node 9.

Next, let's summarize the neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: {7, 8, 2, 3}
- Node 1: {9, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 7, 1, 0}
- Node 3: {5, 6, 0}
- Node 4: {9, 8, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 3}
- Node 6: {9, 1, 3, 8}
- Node 7: {0, 2, 1}
- Node 8: {4, 6, 0, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 6, 4, 2, 1}

Now, for each node that has at least 3 neighbors, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars it forms:
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (9, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 3)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (4, 6, 0)>
- Node 9 forms 2 3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 4)> and <9, (5, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
