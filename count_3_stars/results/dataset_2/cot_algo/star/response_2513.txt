Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 24) (3, 25) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 11) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 4) (21, 18) (21, 29) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 9) (18, 21) (18, 2) (18, 17) (20, 15) (20, 3) (20, 17) (20, 24) (6, 25) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 19) (17, 18) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 22) (16, 17) (16, 24) (16, 8) (8, 25) (8, 16) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (11, 25) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 29) (23, 5) (23, 1) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 29) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 14) (26, 10) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 16) (24, 19) (29, 7) (29, 21) (29, 11) (29, 10) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 13) (5, 11) (5, 23) (14, 22) (12, 15) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 1) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 1) (4, 21) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the neighbor set for each node:

- Node 0: {1, 9, 17}
- Node 1: {0, 7, 9, 13, 23}
- Node 2: {9, 18, 22}
- Node 3: {6, 15, 20, 25}
- Node 4: {10, 18, 21}
- Node 5: {11, 23}
- Node 6: {3, 25, 28}
- Node 7: {1, 19, 29}
- Node 8: {9, 16, 25}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 10: {4, 21, 26, 29}
- Node 11: {5, 19, 25, 29}
- Node 12: {15}
- Node 13: {1, 15, 19, 25}
- Node 14: {22}
- Node 15: {3, 12, 13, 20, 24}
- Node 16: {8, 17, 24}
- Node 17: {0, 16, 18, 20, 22}
- Node 18: {2, 4, 17, 21}
- Node 19: {7, 11, 13, 19, 24, 28}
- Node 20: {3, 15, 17, 20, 24}
- Node 21: {4, 10, 18, 29}
- Node 22: {2, 14, 17}
- Node 23: {1, 5}
- Node 24: {15, 16, 19, 20}
- Node 25: {3, 6, 8, 11, 13}
- Node 26: {10}
- Node 28: {6, 19}
- Node 29: {7, 10, 11, 19}

Now, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 9, 13}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 1, 8}
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes {4, 21, 29}
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes {5, 19, 25}
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 20, 24}
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes {0, 16, 18}
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes {7, 11, 29}
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 15, 17}
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes {2, 17, 14}
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes {15, 20, 16}
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes {3, 11, 13}

Counting all the 3-stars identified, we find that there are a total of 10 unique 3-stars. So, the final number to be put inside brackets is [10].
