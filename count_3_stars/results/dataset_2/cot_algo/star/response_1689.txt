Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 16) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 15) (5, 10) (5, 11) (13, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 18) (9, 8) (9, 13) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 12) (4, 11) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 15) (6, 12) (6, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 16) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 18) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 16) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 1, 7, 17, 19
- Node 1 neighbors: 0, 3
- Node 2 neighbors: 8, 10, 15, 19
- Node 3 neighbors: 1, 16, 17
- Node 4 neighbors: 11
- Node 5 neighbors: 10, 11
- Node 6 neighbors: 12, 14
- Node 7 neighbors: 0, 11, 18
- Node 8 neighbors: 2, 9, 14, 15, 19
- Node 9 neighbors: 8, 13
- Node 10 neighbors: 2, 5, 11
- Node 11 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 10
- Node 12 neighbors: 6, 15, 19
- Node 13 neighbors: 9
- Node 14 neighbors: 6, 8, 16, 18
- Node 15 neighbors: 2, 8, 12
- Node 16 neighbors: 3, 14, 17, 18
- Node 17 neighbors: 3, 16, 0
- Node 18 neighbors: 7, 14, 16
- Node 19 neighbors: 0, 2, 8, 12

Now, let's identify nodes that have at least 3 neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 19)>, <2, (8, 14, 15)>, <8, (2, 14, 19)>, <14, (6, 16, 18)>, <16, (3, 17, 18)>, <19, (0, 8, 12)>
