Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 10) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0 neighbors: 4, 10, 5, 2, 14, 11, 12
- Node 1 neighbors: 8, 5, 7, 10
- Node 2 neighbors: 9, 4, 12, 11
- Node 3 neighbors: 9, 13, 4, 5, 7, 12
- Node 4 neighbors: 0, 10, 5, 3, 2
- Node 5 neighbors: 6, 4, 12, 1, 3
- Node 6 neighbors: 5
- Node 7 neighbors: 9, 14, 3, 1
- Node 8 neighbors: 13, 12, 1
- Node 9 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 13
- Node 10 neighbors: 0, 4, 1
- Node 11 neighbors: 2, 0, 12
- Node 12 neighbors: 8, 5, 2, 0, 11, 3
- Node 13 neighbors: 9, 8, 3, 14
- Node 14 neighbors: 13, 0, 7

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node that has three or more neighbors.

- Node 0: inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars
- Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
- Node 12: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 35 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 103. So, the answer is [103].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (14, 11, 12)>, <1, (8, 7, 10)>, <2, (9, 4, 11)>, <3, (9, 13, 7)>, <4, (10, 5, 3)>, <5, (1, 6, 12)>, <12, (8, 2, 3)>
