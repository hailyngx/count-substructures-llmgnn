Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph in an adjacency list format to better visualize the connections:

0: 5, 1, 3, 6
1: 4, 3, 2, 0, 8
2: 9, 7, 1, 8, 6
3: 9, 4, 7, 1, 0
4: 9, 7, 8, 1, 3
5: 0
6: 7, 2, 0
7: 9, 4, 3, 6, 2
8: 4, 1, 2
9: 4, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {9, 7, 1, 8, 6}. There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 2 as the center. 
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {9, 7, 8, 1, 3}. There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 4 as the center. 
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: {9, 4, 3, 6, 2}. There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 7 as the center. 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {4, 3, 2, 0, 8}. There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 1 as the center. 
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {9, 4, 7, 1, 0}. There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 3 as the center. 

Adding them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (4, 3, 2)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
