Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create a list of neighbors for each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: {2, 8}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 4}
- Node 4: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {5, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4, 6, 7}

Next, we identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes can potentially form 3-stars. In this case, nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

So, the final answer is [50], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
