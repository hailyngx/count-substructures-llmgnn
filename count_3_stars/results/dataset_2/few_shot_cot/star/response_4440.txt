Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
