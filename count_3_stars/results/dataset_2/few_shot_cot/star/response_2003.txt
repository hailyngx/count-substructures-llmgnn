Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 24: 10
- From Node 27: 10
