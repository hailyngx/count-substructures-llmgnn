Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
