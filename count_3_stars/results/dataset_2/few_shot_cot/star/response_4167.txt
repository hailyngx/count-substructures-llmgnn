  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 18} (3 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {8, 17, 4, 12, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
