Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 15} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 8, 7, 5} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 14} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 3} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 16, 15} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {19, 14, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 17, 7} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 12} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 1, 19} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 18, 1} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {18, 15, 7} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {0, 13, 6} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {19, 6} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {12, 3, 13} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 16} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 1: 4
        - From Node 3: 10
        - From Node 6: 4
        - From Node 7: 4
        - From Node 8: 4
        - From Node 9: 1
        - From Node 11: 4
        - From Node 12: 4
        - From Node 13: 1
        - From Node 15: 1
        - From Node 17: 1
        - From Node 18: 1
        - From Node 19: 1
        Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 40
        Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
