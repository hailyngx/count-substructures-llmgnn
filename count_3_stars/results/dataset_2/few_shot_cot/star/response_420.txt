Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 11, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <17, (5, 10, 3)>
  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 8, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {6, 18, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
