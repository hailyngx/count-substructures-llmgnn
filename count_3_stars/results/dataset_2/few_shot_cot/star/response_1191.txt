Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 22: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
