Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <0, (8, 9, 3)>, <0, (8, 9, 7)>, <0, (8, 7, 3)>, <0, (9, 7, 3)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-stars: <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 6, 4)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <2, (9, 4, 3)>, <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 8, 3)>, <2, (4, 8, 3)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <3, (6, 4, 2)>, <3, (6, 4, 0)>, <3, (6, 2, 0)>, <3, (4, 2, 0)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <4, (6, 3, 1)>, <4, (6, 3, 2)>, <4, (6, 1, 2)>, <4, (3, 1, 2)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <5, (9, 1, 7)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-stars: <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <7, (5, 9, 0)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-star: <8, (2, 0, 1)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 1, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - 3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 2, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 2, 0)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 0)>, <9, (5, 7, 0)>, <9, (6, 2, 1)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 0)>, <9, (2, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in the given graph.
