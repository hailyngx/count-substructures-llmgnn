Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 12, 14, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 6, 2, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 12, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 13, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 11, 6, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 12, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 10, 0, 9, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 6, 3, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 1, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 68

Therefore, there are a total of [68] 3-stars in your graph.
