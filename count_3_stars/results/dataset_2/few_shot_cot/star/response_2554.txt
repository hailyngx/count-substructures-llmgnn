Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

From Node 0: 4 configurations
From Node 1: 1 configuration
From Node 2: 1 configuration
From Node 3: 4 configurations
From Node 4: 10 configurations
From Node 5: 4 configurations
From Node 6: 4 configurations
From Node 7: 20 configurations
From Node 8: 20 configurations
From Node 9: 10 configurations
From Node 11: 10 configurations
From Node 12: 4 configurations

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 92

Therefore, there are a total of [92] 3-stars in your graph.
