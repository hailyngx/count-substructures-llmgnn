Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we'll follow the same approach used in the example.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Neighbors = {25, 18} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Neighbors = {15, 0, 7, 28} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: Neighbors = {10, 4} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: Neighbors = {3, 17} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: Neighbors = {6, 18, 16, 14} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 6: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Neighbors = {8, 13, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 8: Neighbors = {13, 24, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 9: Neighbors = {15, 29} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 10: Neighbors = {3, 12, 14, 22} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 11: Neighbors = {25, 12} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: Neighbors = {27, 10, 24, 11} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 13: Neighbors = {8, 28, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 14: Neighbors = {5, 26, 22, 19, 10} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 15: Neighbors = {27, 16, 9, 29, 2} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 16: Neighbors = {15, 5, 28, 17} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 17: Neighbors = {16, 24, 4} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 18: Neighbors = {5, 19, 1} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 19: Neighbors = {21, 18, 29, 14, 28} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 20: Neighbors = {29} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 21: Neighbors = {25, 19, 26} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 22: Neighbors = {14, 28, 10} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 23: Neighbors = {27} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 24: Neighbors = {8, 12, 17} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 25: Neighbors = {1, 21, 11} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 26: Neighbors = {21, 14} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 27: Neighbors = {15, 12, 23} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 28: Neighbors = {13, 2, 16, 19, 22} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 29: Neighbors = {15, 20, 9, 19} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the 3-star configurations from each node:
4 (Node 2) + 4 (Node 5) + 1 (Node 7) + 1 (Node 8) + 4 (Node 10) + 4 (Node 12) + 1 (Node 13) + 10 (Node 14) + 10 (Node 15) + 4 (Node 16) + 1 (Node 17) + 1 (Node 18) + 10 (Node 19) + 1 (Node 21) + 1 (Node 22) + 1 (Node 24) + 1 (Node 25) + 1 (Node 27) + 10 (Node 28) + 4 (Node 29) = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
