Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
From the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
