Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 2, 16, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 17, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 13, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 0, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 16, 0} (4 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
