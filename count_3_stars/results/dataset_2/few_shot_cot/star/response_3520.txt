Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll go through each node to determine the number of 3-star configurations:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 5} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1

- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 10
