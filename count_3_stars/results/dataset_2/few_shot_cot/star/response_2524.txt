Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 18, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 17, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 10} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
