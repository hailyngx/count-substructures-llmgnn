Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <1, (9, 5, 4)>, <1, (9, 5, 0)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (9, 4, 0)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 5, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <4, (6, 1, 3)>, <4, (6, 1, 2)>, <4, (6, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <6, (7, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, 2, 4)>, <6, (7, 8, 4)>, <6, (2, 8, 4)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (6, 9, 5)>, <7, (6, 9, 8)>, <7, (6, 3, 5)>, <7, (6, 3, 8)>, <7, (6, 5, 8)>, <7, (9, 3, 5)>, <7, (9, 3, 8)>, <7, (9, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 5, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <8, (6, 3, 5)>, <8, (6, 3, 7)>, <8, (6, 3, 0)>, <8, (6, 5, 7)>, <8, (6, 5, 0)>, <8, (6, 7, 0)>, <8, (3, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 0)>, <8, (3, 7, 0)>, <8, (5, 7, 0)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <9, (3, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 1, 0)>, <9, (3, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars: 

- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
