Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 15, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 18, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 19, 11, 17} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {19, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 19, 12, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 3, 11, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 19, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 9, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 10} (3 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 5, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
