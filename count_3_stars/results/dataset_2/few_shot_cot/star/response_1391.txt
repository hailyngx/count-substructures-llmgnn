Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 10, 1, 13, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 13, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 10, 11, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 14, 7, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 13, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 0, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
