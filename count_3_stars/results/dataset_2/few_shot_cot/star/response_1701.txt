Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
