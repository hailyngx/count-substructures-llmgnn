Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in your graph.
