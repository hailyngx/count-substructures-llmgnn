Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed centered at each node:

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1

- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
