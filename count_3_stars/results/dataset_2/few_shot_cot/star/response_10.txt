Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 10, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (6, 10, 12)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 10, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (5, 10, 12)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {15, 2, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (2, 15, 19)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 8, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (8, 13, 17)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 10, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (1, 7, 10)>
  - <8, (1, 7, 14)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {17, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 4, 12, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <10, (2, 4, 12)>
  - <10, (4, 8, 12)>
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 1, 15} (4 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <12, (2, 10, 19)>
  - <12, (4, 10, 17)>
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 19, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <15, (6, 11, 19)>
  
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {18, 5, 4, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 15, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 2
- From Node 10: 2
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 2
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
