Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 3, 2, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
