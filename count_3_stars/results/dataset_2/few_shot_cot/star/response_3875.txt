Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
