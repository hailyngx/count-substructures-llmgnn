Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 16, 23} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12, 17, 24, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
