- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 14} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {0, 15, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
