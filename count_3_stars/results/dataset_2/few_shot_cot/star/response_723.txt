Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
