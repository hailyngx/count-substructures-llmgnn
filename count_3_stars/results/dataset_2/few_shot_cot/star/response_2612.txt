Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 1, 19, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 19, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 10, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 19, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 18, 6} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
