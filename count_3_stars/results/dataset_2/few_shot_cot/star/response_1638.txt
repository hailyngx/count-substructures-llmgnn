Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
From Node 0: 1
From Node 1: 4
From Node 2: 4
From Node 3: 4
From Node 4: 4
From Node 5: 4
From Node 6: 1
From Node 7: 1
From Node 11: 1
From Node 12: 1
From Node 15: 1
From Node 16: 1
From Node 17: 4
From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
