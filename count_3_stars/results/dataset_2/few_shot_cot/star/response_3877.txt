Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 2, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 9, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 4, 5, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 12, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 13} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14, 15, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 3} (2 neighbors). Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 12, 17, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 14, 7, 10, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 15, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 18, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
