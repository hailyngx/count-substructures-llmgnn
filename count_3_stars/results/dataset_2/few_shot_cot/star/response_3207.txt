Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 13, 8, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 14, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 10, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 15} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 3, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 15, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 18, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 8, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 1, 15} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 3, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
