Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Star configurations: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 2)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Star configurations: <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star configurations: <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Star configurations: <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Star configurations: <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 8, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-Star configurations: <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Star configurations: <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 1)>, <7, (0, 6, 2)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Star configurations: <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (7, 6, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Star configurations: <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
