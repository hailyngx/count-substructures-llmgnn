Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {27, 21, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {18, 17, 20} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 17, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
