Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 42
Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
