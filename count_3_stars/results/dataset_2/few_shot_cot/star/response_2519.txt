Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 2, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 7, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
