Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 74
