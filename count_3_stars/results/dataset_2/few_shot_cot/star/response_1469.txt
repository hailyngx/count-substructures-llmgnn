Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
