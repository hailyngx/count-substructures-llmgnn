Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 4
