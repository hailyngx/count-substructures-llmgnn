Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star configurations: <8, (5, 4, 1)>, <8, (5, 4, 6)>, <8, (5, 1, 6)>, <8, (4, 1, 0)>, <8, (4, 6, 0)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 3
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 5
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
