Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 27
- From Nodes with 4 neighbors: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40

Total number of 3-stars = 27 + 40 = 67

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in your graph.
