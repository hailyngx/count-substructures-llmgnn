Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 1 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
