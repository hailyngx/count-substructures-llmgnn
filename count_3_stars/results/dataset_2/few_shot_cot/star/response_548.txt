Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (5, 4, 1)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>, <0, (5, 1, 2)>, <0, (4, 1, 2)>, <0, (5, 1, 9)>, <0, (5, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (4, 1, 9)>, <0, (4, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (4, 7, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 0)>, <1, (4, 6, 0)>, <1, (7, 6, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (9, 3, 8)>, <2, (9, 3, 0)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (2, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 2)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 3, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 1, 7)>, <6, (4, 0, 1)>, <6, (4, 0, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
