Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4

- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
