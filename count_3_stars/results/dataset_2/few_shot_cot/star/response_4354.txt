Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 2, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 0, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 6, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in the given graph.
