Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 14, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 20**: Unconnected, thus cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
