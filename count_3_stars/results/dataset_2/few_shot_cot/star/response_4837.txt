Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 26: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
