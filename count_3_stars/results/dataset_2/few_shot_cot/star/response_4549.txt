Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 4, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 13, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 2, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 14, 0, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
