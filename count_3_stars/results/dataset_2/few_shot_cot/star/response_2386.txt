Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the provided graph using the method described:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 0, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
