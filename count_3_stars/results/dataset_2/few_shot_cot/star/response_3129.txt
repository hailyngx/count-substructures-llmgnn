Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we will calculate the 3-stars for nodes that have three or more neighbors. Remember, for nodes with exactly three neighbors, only one 3-star is formed.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 25, 6, 24} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {28, 13, 5, 29, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 27} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {15, 17, 26, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {22} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {23, 2, 10, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {18, 19, 29, 24} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {25} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {16, 13, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in your graph.
