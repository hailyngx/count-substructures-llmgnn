Response:
Following the provided example, we will calculate the number of 3-stars by examining each node in the given graph:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 3, 11} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 17, 19, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 15, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {14, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 17, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 17, 15, 11} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 18, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 12, 11} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {15, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 15, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [39].
