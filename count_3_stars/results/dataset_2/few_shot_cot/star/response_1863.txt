Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 5)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <1, (0, 2, 9)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 6)>, <2, (0, 8, 6)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <3, (0, 5, 9)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <4, (2, 5, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 0, 4)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)

  - Possible 3-star configurations: <6, (2, 7, 8)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: <9, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (0, 1, 4)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 8, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 8, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 8, 7)>, <9, (4, 8, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 56
Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
