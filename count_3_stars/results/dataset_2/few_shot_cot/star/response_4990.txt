Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 12} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 7, 14, 13} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8, 7, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 3, 14, 1, 2} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 12, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 3, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 93
Therefore, there are a total of [93] 3-stars in your graph.
