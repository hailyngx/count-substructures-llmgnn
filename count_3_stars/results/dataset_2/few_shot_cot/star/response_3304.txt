Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 22: 4
