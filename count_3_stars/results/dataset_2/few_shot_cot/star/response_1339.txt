Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 2, 11, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 0, 11, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 2, 14, 10, 3} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 1, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 7, 12, 11} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
