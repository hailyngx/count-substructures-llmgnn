Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 7, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 2, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 10, 3, 2, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 10, 1, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 8, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 0, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
