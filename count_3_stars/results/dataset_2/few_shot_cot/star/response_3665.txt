Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 12, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 14, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 12, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 2, 9, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 9, 13, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 7, 13, 14, 3} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 12, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars in the graph = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
