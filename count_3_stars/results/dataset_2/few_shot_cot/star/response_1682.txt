Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 14} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 0, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 10, 13, 1} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 0, 10} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 11, 1} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 13, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12, 13, 3} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 11} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12, 11, 10, 14} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 13} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 20
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
