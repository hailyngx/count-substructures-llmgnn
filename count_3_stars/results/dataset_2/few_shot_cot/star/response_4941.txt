Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 10, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 11, 14, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 19, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 17, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 12, 16, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 18, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
