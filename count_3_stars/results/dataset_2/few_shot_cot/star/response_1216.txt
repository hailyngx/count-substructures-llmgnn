Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 19, 16, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {27, 14, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 56
