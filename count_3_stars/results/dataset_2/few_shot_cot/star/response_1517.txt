Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 16, 15, 11, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {17, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {18, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 18, 17, 10} (4 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
