Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (6, 9, 1)>, <0, (6, 9, 8)>, <0, (6, 9, 2)>, <0, (6, 1, 8)>, <0, (6, 1, 2)>, <0, (6, 8, 2)>, <0, (9, 1, 8)>, <0, (9, 1, 2)>, <0, (9, 8, 2)>, <0, (1, 8, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (7, 5, 0)>, <1, (7, 5, 8)>, <1, (7, 0, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (9, 4, 7)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>, <2, (9, 7, 0)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (9, 4, 7)>, <3, (9, 4, 8)>, <3, (9, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (7, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <4, (8, 3, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (5, 7, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (6, 4, 2)>, <7, (6, 4, 1)>, <7, (6, 3, 2)>, <7, (6, 3, 1)>, <7, (6, 2, 1)>, <7, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (4, 3, 1)>, <7, (4, 2, 1)>, <7, (3, 2, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (9, 4, 3)>, <8, (9, 4, 0)>, <8, (9, 1, 3)>, <8, (9, 1, 0)>, <8, (9, 3, 0)>, <8, (4, 1, 3)>, <8, (4, 1, 0)>, <8, (4, 3, 0)>, <8, (1, 3, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (8, 2, 3)>, <9, (8, 2, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 0)>, <9, (2, 3, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars: 
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
