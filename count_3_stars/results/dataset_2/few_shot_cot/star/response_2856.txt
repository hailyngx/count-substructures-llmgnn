Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 11, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 9, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 10, 14, 1, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 11, 10, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 2, 14, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 1, 9, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 6, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 3, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 97

Therefore, there are a total of [97] 3-stars in your graph.
