Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (4, 3, 6)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 6, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (7, 2, 6)>, <3, (7, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (7, 2, 5)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 5, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (7, 5, 6)>, <4, (7, 2, 6)>, <4, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 6, 2)>, <4, (7, 5, 9)>, <4, (7, 2, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (5, 2, 9)>, <4, (6, 2, 9)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (4, 7, 3)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 3, 8)>, <5, (7, 3, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <5, (7, 0, 3)>, <5, (7, 0, 8)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>, <5, (4, 0, 8)>, <5, (3, 0, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 8, 1, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (4, 7, 3)>, <6, (4, 7, 2)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, 3, 8)>, <6, (7, 2, 3)>, <6, (7, 2, 8)>, <6, (3, 2, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 1)>, <6, (4, 1, 3)>, <6, (4, 1, 2)>, <6, (4, 1, 8)>, <6, (7, 1, 3)>, <6, (7, 1, 2)>, <6, (7, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (4, 3, 2)>, <6, (4, 3, 8)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 9, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (4, 9, 6)>, <7, (4, 9, 2)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <7, (9, 5, 6)>, <7, (9, 5, 2)>, <7, (5, 3, 6)>, <7, (5, 2, 6)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (2, 9, 6)>, <8, (2, 9, 5)>, <8, (2, 6, 5)>, <8, (9, 5, 6)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Star: <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
