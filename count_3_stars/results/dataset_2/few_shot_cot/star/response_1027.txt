Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 22: 4
