Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 9, and node 8

Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6, 9, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 5, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 8, 9, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 5, 0, 2} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
