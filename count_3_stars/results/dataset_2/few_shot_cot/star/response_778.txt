Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 18, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {19, 6, 18, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 9, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {17, 2, 5, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 16, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 10, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 11, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 16, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 16, 12, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 7, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
