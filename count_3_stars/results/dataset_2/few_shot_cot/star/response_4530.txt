Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - The 3-star: <1, (5, 8, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - The 3-stars: <2, (9, 3, 1)>, <2, (9, 3, 4)>, <2, (9, 1, 4)>, <2, (3, 1, 4)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 7, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - The 3-stars: <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (6, 9, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (9, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 9, 2)>, <3, (6, 7, 2)>, <3, (9, 7, 2)>, <3, (6, 8, 2)>, <3, (9, 8, 2)>, <3, (7, 8, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - The 3-star: <4, (9, 5, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 4, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - The 3-stars: <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 0, 7)>, <5, (4, 0, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - The 3-stars: <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 5, 0)>, <6, (9, 3, 0)>, <6, (5, 3, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (3, 8, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - The 3-star: <7, (9, 5, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - The 3-stars: <8, (6, 9, 3)>, <8, (6, 9, 1)>, <8, (6, 3, 1)>, <8, (9, 3, 1)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 2, 3, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - The 3-stars: <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 4, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 2, 3)>, <9, (8, 2, 7)>, <9, (8, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
