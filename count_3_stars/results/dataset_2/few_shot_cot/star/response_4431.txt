Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 12, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 5, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 14, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 9, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 11, 8, 13, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 9, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 12, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 5, 3, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in the given graph.
