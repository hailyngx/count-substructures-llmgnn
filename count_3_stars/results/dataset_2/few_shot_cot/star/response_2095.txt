Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- Total from Node 1: 1
- Total from Node 2: 1
- Total from Node 3: 4
- Total from Node 4: 10
- Total from Node 5: 4
- Total from Node 6: 4
- Total from Node 8: 4
- Total from Node 9: 10
- Total from Node 10: 20
- Total from Node 11: 4
- Total from Node 12: 10
- Total from Node 13: 4
- Total from Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
