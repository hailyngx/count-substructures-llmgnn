Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 7, 1, 9} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 9} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 6, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 3} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 0, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 10  
- From Node 1: 4  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 3: 4  
- From Node 4: 10  
- From Node 5: 1  
- From Node 6: 1  
- From Node 7: 1  
- From Node 8: 10  
- From Node 9: 10  

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 52  

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
