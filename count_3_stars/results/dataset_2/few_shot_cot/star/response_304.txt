Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 16, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <0, (1, 16, 5)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <1, (13, 4, 0)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <2, (6, 8, 18)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <3, (7, 19, 5)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 8, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <4, (1, 10, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 16, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <5, (3, 0, 16)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <6, (9, 17, 2)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 15, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <9, (6, 15, 13)>

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {19, 15} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <12, (1, 13, 5)>

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 18, 16, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <13, (9, 18, 16)>

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <15, (9, 11, 19)>

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {0, 13, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <16, (0, 5, 13)>

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <17, (6, 10, 18)>

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {17, 2, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <18, (17, 2, 13)>

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 4, 15} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (There is only one combination possible)
    - 3-star: <19, (3, 11, 15)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
