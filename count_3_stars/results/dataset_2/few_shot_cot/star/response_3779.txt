Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 20, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 15, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 25, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 23: 10
- From Node 26: 10
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
