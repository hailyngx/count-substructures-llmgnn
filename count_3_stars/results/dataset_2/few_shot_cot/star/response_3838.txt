Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Neighbors = {13, 10} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Neighbors = {18, 8, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: Neighbors = {18, 9, 12, 19} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 4: Neighbors = {2, 18, 16, 11} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 5: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Neighbors = {10, 0} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Neighbors = {14, 17, 15} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 8: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Neighbors = {8, 17, 16, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 10: Neighbors = {6, 13, 1, 15} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 11: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: Neighbors = {2, 14, 16, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 13: Neighbors = {5, 1, 10, 19} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 14: Neighbors = {7, 12} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 15: Neighbors = {10, 19, 7, 16} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 16: Neighbors = {18, 4, 15, 9, 12} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 17: Neighbors = {9, 7} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 18: Neighbors = {2, 4, 16, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 19: Neighbors = {13, 15, 3} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
