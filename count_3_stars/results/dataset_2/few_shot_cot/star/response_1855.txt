Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <0, (1, 3, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 2, 0, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <1, (9, 3, 2)>
    - <1, (9, 3, 8)>
    - <1, (9, 2, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 2, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <2, (4, 1, 5)>
    - <2, (4, 1, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <3, (7, 1, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <6, (9, 1, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <7, (9, 3, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 1, 3, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <8, (6, 1, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <9, (6, 1, 7)>
    - <9, (6, 1, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 2
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 2

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
