Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (6, 4, 2)>, <0, (6, 4, 1)>, <0, (6, 2, 1)>, <0, (4, 2, 1)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 8, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 0)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>, <1, (6, 8, 0)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (6, 4, 0)>, <1, (6, 5, 4)>, <1, (6, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <1, (6, 8, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (6, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 0, 7)>, <1, (6, 0, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 6, 3)>, <2, (9, 0, 3)>, <2, (6, 0, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 2)>, <3, (5, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 8, 2)>, <3, (5, 7, 2)>, <3, (4, 8, 2)>, <3, (4, 7, 2)>, <3, (8, 7, 2)>, <3, (4, 8, 7)>, <3, (4, 2, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (9, 0, 1)>, <4, (9, 0, 3)>, <4, (9, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 2, 8, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <6, (5, 9, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 2)>, <6, (5, 9, 8)>, <6, (5, 9, 0)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 0)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 0)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 0)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 0)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (2, 8, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
