Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 16, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 6, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 17, 13, 5, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 14, 11, 7, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {15, 17, 8, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {10, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
