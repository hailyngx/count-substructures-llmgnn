Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 13: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 104

Therefore, there are a total of [104] 3-stars in your graph.
