Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 23, 20, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 23, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 10
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
