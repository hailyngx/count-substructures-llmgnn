Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 2
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
