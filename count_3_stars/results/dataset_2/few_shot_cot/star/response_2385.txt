Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 13, 10, 14, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 12, 0, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (2, 0, 10)>, <5, (2, 0, 14)>, <5, (2, 10, 14)>, <5, (0, 10, 14)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 8, 14, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 2, 13, 1, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 9, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 3, 9)>, <8, (7, 3, 9)>, <8, (4, 3, 6)>, <8, (4, 9, 6)>, <8, (3, 9, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 14, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 10 (with 4 unique 3-stars)
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 10 (with 6 unique 3-stars)
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 102

Therefore, there are a total of [102] 3-stars in your graph.
