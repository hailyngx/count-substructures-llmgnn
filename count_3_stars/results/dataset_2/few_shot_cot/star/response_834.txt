Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 0, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 3, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
