Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 0, 3, 6} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
