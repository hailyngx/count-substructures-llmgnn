Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 18, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 13, 15, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 10} (2 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 13, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in the given graph.
