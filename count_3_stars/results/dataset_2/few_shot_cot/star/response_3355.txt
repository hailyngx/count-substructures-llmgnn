Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
