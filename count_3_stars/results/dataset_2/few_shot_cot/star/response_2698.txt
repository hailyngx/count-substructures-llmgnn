Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 0, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 12, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 10, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1, 10, 3, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbor = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 11, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 1, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 3, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 2, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
