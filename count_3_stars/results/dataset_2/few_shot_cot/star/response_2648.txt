Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 14, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 15, 7, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {18, 19, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 1, 19, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 8, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors={11, 5, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 0, 9, 19} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {16, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {12, 4, 14, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 46
Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
