Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}  = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}  = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}  = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}  = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}  = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 1, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in your graph.
