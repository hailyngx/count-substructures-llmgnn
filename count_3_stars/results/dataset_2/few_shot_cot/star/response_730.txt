Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 7, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <0, (9, 6, 7)>, <0, (9, 6, 3)>, <0, (9, 6, 2)>, <0, (9, 7, 3)>, <0, (9, 7, 2)>, <0, (9, 3, 2)>, <0, (6, 7, 3)>, <0, (6, 7, 2)>, <0, (6, 3, 2)>, <0, (7, 3, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 0, 7, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <2, (4, 6, 0)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 1)>, <2, (4, 0, 7)>, <2, (4, 0, 1)>, <2, (4, 7, 1)>, <2, (6, 0, 7)>, <2, (6, 0, 1)>, <2, (6, 7, 1)>, <2, (0, 7, 1)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <3, (5, 9, 0)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (5, 0, 7)>, <3, (9, 0, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (8, 1, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <6, (5, 8, 2)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 2, 0)>, <6, (8, 2, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 3, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <7, (8, 0, 3)>, <7, (8, 0, 2)>, <7, (8, 0, 1)>, <7, (8, 3, 2)>, <7, (8, 3, 1)>, <7, (8, 2, 1)>, <7, (0, 3, 2)>, <7, (0, 3, 1)>, <7, (0, 2, 1)>, <7, (3, 2, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 7, 6)>, <8, (9, 7, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 0)>
- **Node 10**: Unconnected to any other nodes
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
