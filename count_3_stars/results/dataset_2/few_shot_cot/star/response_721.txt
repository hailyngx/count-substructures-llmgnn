Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 11, 12, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 14, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 9, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 12, 10, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 5, 11, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 14, 7, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 12, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 0, 7, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 12, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
