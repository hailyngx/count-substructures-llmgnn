Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 11} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 14, 13} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 7} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 0, 3, 14, 13} (6 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 0, 12, 14} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 8, 6, 14, 11} (6 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 6, 10} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 12, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 1: 4
        - From Node 2: 1
        - From Node 3: 1
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 5: 1
        - From Node 6: 4
        - From Node 7: 20
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 4
        - From Node 10: 1
        - From Node 11: 10
        - From Node 12: 20
        - From Node 13: 10
        - From Node 14: 10
        
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 88
        Therefore, there are a total of [88] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
