Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 10, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 0, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 9, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 13, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 6, 0, 7, 14} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 14, 7, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 5, 6, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 12, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 7, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 6, 0, 7, 12} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 92

Therefore, there are a total of [92] 3-stars in your graph.
