Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30
Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
