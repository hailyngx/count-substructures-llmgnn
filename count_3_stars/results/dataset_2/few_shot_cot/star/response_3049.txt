Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 14} (2 neighbors) -> Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 5} (2 neighbors) -> Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 13} (3 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 15, 17, 14} (4 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {16, 19, 9, 6} (4 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 1} (3 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 4} (3 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 14, 1, 8} (4 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16, 17, 7, 19} (4 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {18, 4} (2 neighbors) -> Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 6, 5} (4 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 17} (3 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 7} (2 neighbors) -> Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 18, 14} (3 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 0, 13} (4 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 10} (2 neighbors) -> Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 4} (3 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 12, 8} (4 neighbors) -> Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9, 13} (2 neighbors) -> Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {8, 4} (2 neighbors) -> Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
