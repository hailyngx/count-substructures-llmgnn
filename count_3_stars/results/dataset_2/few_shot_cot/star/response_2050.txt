Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 14, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 10, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 6, 0, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 12, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 4, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8, 12, 11, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 89

Therefore, there are a total of [89] 3-stars in your graph.
