Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
