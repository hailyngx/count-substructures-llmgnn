Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 3} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 8, 1} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 7, 8, 0} (6 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 2: 10
        - From Node 3: 20
        - From Node 4: 4
        - From Node 5: 1
        - From Node 6: 10
        - From Node 7: 4
        - From Node 8: 4
        - From Node 9: 4
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 58
        Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
