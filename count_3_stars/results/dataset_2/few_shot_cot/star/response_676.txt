Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 12} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 15} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 19, 15} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 5, 17, 12} (5 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 0, 10, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 15} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 18, 0, 3, 19} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 4, 17} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {6, 5, 14, 17} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
