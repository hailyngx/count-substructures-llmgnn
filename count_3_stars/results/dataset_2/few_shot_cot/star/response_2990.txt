Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {27, 16, 3, 18, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {27, 18, 19, 20} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 28} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 26} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3}\) = 1

- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
