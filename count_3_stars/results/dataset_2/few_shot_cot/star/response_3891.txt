Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
