Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
    - <0, (4, 6, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
    - <1, (9, 3, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
    - <2, (4, 3, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 6, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

    - <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <4, (7, 2, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (9, 7, 0)>, <4, (9, 2, 0)>, <4, (7, 2, 0)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
    - <5, (4, 9, 7)>, <5, (4, 9, 3)>, <5, (4, 7, 3)>, <5, (9, 7,3)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
    - <7, (5, 4, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
    - <8, (9, 3, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 4, 1, 7} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
    - <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 1)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>
    
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in your graph.
