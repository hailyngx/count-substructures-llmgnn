Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 12, 6, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 12, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 12, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 2, 10, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 11, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 0, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in the given graph.
