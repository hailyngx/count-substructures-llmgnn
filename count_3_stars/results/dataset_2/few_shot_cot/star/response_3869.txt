Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
