Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
