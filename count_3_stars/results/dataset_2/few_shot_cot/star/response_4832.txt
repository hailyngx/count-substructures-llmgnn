Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 18, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {16, 15, 10, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 6, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
