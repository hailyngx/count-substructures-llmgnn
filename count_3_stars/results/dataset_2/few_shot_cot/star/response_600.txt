Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 23: 10
- From Node 24: 1
