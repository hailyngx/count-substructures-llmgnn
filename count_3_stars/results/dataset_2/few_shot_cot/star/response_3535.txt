Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
