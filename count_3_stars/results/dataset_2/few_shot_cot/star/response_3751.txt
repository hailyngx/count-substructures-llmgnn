Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 0, 6, 5, 8} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9, 5, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 71

Therefore, there are a total of [71] 3-stars in your graph.
