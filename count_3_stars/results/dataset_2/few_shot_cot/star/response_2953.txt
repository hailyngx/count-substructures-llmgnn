Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 4, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbor = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 2, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
