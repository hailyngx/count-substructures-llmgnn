Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (11, 2, 6)>, <1, (11, 2, 0)>, <1, (11, 6, 0)>, <1, (2, 6, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 1, 7, 4} (5 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
