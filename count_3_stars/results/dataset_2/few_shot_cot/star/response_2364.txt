Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 2, 0, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 5, 4, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 2, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
