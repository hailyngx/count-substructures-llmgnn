Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list, we'll now calculate the number of 3-stars around each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {18, 13, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 9, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {17, 2, 16, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 16, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 3, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 19, 6, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 18, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 15, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {14, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
