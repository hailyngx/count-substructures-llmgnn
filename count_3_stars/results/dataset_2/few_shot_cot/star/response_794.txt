Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <0, (4, 1, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (3, 2, 0)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>, <1, (3, 0, 8)>, <1, (2, 0, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 1, 8, 5, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (7, 9, 1)>, <2, (7, 9, 8)>, <2, (7, 9, 5)>, <2, (7, 1, 8)>, <2, (7, 1, 5)>, <2, (7, 8, 5)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)>, <2, (9, 1, 5)>, <2, (9, 8, 5)>, <2, (1, 8, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 1, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <3, (7, 9, 1)>, <3, (7, 9, 5)>, <3, (7, 9, 8)>, <3, (7, 1, 5)>, <3, (7, 1, 8)>, <3, (9, 1, 5)>, <3, (9, 1, 8)>, <3, (9, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <4, (7, 0, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <5, (3, 8, 2)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Star: <6, (4, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 9, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <7, (4, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (4, 9, 2)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 2)>, <7, (3, 9, 2)>, <7, (6, 9, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <8, (1, 3, 2)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (3, 2, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <9, (7, 6, 2)>, <9, (7, 6, 3)>, <9, (7, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 2, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
