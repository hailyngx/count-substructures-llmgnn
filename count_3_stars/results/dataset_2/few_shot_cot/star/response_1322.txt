Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
