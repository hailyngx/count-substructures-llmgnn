Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 19} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 1, 10, 17} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 9, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {18, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 17} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 2, 19, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 5, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {18, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 1, 10, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 15} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 18, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 17, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
