Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 16, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 0, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {2, 13, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 14, 7, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 0} (3 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
