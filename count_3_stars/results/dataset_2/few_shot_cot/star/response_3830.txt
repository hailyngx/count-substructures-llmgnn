Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 7, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
