Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 5, 9, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 0, 9, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 9, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 9, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
