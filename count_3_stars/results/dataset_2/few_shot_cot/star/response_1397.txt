Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node: 

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 16, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 19, 14, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 19, 10, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 18, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 2, 10, 15} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
