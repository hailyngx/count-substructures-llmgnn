- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
