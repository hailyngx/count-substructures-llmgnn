Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 19, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 17, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {13, 19, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 16, 18, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 25

Therefore, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in your graph.
