Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
