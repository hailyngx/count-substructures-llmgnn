Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has at least three neighbors. Here's the breakdown for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 18, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {23, 29} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {22, 27} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {26, 10, 28, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 20, 6, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {29, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {22, 4, 25} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {26, 28, 23, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 3, 18, 27} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {12, 14, 20, 25} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {21, 11, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {15, 27} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {16, 28, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {26, 13, 23, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {28, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 27} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10, 20, 27, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 21, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 20**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 22**: Neighbors = {23, 2, 6, 24} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 23**: Neighbors = {9, 22, 15, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 24**: Neighbors = {22, 25} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 25**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 26**: Neighbors = {9, 15, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 27**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 17, 2, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 28**: Neighbors = {9, 16, 3, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Adding up all the valid configurations, we get:
4 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 6) + 4 (from Node 9) + 4 (from Node 10) + 4 (from Node 11) + 1 (from Node 12) + 1 (from Node 14) + 4 (from Node 15) + 1 (from Node 17) + 4 (from Node 18) + 1 (from Node 19) + 1 (from Node 20) + 4 (from Node 22) + 4 (from Node 23) + 1 (from Node 25) + 1 (from Node 26) + 10 (from Node 27) + 4 (from Node 28) = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
