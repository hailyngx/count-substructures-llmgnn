Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
