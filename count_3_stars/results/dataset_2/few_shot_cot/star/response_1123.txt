Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 7, 11, 12, 5} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 10, 13, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 13, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 6, 12, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 2, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 14, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 2, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 12, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
