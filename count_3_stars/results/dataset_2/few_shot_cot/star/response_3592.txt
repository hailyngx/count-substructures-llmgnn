Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node as follows:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 15, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (7, 15, 14)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (4, 10, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 17, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
