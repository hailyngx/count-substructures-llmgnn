Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 9, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 11, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-star configurations: 
    - <4, (1, 11, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 19, 9)>
    - <4, (1, 11, 19)>
    - <4, (11, 19, 9)>

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 19, 10, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
