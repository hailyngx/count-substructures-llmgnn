Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
