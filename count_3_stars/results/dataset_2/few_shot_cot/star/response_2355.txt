Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations found:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
