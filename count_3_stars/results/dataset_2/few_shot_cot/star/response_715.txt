Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 6, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (13, 6, 14)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 10, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (4, 9, 10)>, <2, (4, 9, 11)>, <2, (4, 10, 11)>, <2, (9, 10, 11)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (7, 13, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 5, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (7, 10, 5)>, <4, (7, 10, 11)>, <4, (7, 5, 11)>, <4, (10, 5, 11)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 11)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 3, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (2, 0, 3)>, <9, (2, 0, 11)>, <9, (2, 3, 11)>, <9, (0, 3, 11)>
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 2, 3, 14} (5 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <12, (7, 13, 10)>
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 3, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <13, (12, 3, 1)>, <13, (12, 3, 6)>, <13, (12, 1, 6)>, <13, (3, 1, 6)>
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 1, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 47

Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
