Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 26: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 54
Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
