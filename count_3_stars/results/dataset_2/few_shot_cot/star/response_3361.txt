Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 22: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
