Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <0, (6, 8, 2)>, <0, (6, 8, 1)>, <0, (6, 2, 1)>, <0, (8, 2, 1)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 0)>, <1, (9, 8, 0)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 4, 3)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>, <2, (9, 8, 3)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 3, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 3)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 3, 0)>, <2, (8, 3, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 2, 1)>, <4, (8, 2, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <6, (9, 7, 8)>, <6, (9, 7, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 0, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
  - <8, (4, 6, 2)>, <8, (4, 6, 0)>, <8, (4, 6, 3)>, <8, (4, 6, 1)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <8, (4, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 2, 1)>, <8, (4, 0, 3)>, <8, (4, 0, 1)>, <8, (4, 3, 1)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>, <8, (6, 2, 3)>, <8, (6, 2, 1)>, <8, (6, 0, 3)>, <8, (6, 0, 1)>, <8, (6, 3, 1)>, <8, (2, 0, 3)>, <8, (2, 0, 1)>, <8, (2, 3, 1)>, <8, (0, 3, 1)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
  - <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 2, 3)>, <9, (5, 2, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 2, 1)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 1)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 1)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 1, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
