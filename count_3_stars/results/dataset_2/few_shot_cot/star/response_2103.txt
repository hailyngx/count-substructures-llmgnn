Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 14, 10, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 5, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 5, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 10, 11, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 2, 12, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 0, 12, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 11, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in your graph.
