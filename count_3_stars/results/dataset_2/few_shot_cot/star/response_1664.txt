Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9, 4, 12, 11} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 12, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9, 1, 3, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 12, 2, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 2, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 10, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 9, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 0, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 3, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 12: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
