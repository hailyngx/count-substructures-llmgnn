Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 6, 12, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 5, 6, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 11, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 1, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 11, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 3, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 1, 13, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 14, 9, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in your graph.
