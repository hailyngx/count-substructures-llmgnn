Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- Node 0: Neighbors = {13, 10, 19} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Node 1: Neighbors = {13, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Node 2: Neighbors = {6, 10, 1, 19, 4} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- Node 3: Neighbors = {15, 7} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 4: Neighbors = {16, 2} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 5: Neighbors = {9, 6, 14} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Node 6: Neighbors = {5, 2, 18, 8} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 7: Neighbors = {3, 13, 16} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Node 8: Neighbors = {6, 12} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 9: Neighbors = {15, 5, 18} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Node 10: Neighbors = {15, 0, 19, 2} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 11: Neighbors = {1, 17} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 12: Neighbors = {17, 18, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Node 13: Neighbors = {17, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 14: Neighbors = {15, 5} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 15: Neighbors = {3, 10, 9, 14} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 16: Neighbors = {7, 4} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Node 17: Neighbors = {13, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Node 18: Neighbors = {9, 6, 12} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Node 19: Neighbors = {10, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
