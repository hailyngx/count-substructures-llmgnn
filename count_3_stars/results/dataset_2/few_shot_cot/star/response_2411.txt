Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we can determine the number of 3-star configurations for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {29, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {29, 25, 12, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {26, 16, 20, 13, 23} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {28, 16, 13, 23} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding the valid configurations for each node:
4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in the graph.
