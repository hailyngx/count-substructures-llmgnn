Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {27, 22, 18, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
