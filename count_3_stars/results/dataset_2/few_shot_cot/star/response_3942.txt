Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
