Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (5, 2, 9)>, <1, (4, 2, 9)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (5, 2, 0)>, <1, (4, 2, 0)>, <1, (5, 9, 0)>, <1, (4, 9, 0)>, <1, (2, 9, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (5, 8, 1)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (8, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 8, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (7, 6, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 2)>, <3, (7, 6, 2)>, <3, (6, 8, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (5, 4, 3)>, <7, (5, 0, 3)>, <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 0)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (4, 9, 0)>, <7, (4, 9, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 3)>, <8, (9, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 2, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 1)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
