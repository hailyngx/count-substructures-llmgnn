Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1

- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in the given graph.
