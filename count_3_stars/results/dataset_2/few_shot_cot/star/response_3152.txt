Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Node 0: Neighbors = {4, 1, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 1: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 2: Neighbors = {7, 6} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 3: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 4: Neighbors = {7, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 5: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 6: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 8, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
Node 7: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 9: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
