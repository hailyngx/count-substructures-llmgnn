Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 18, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
