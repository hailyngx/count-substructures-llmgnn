Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 19} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 15} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 11, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 16, 6} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 17, 14} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 14} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 19} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 1, 3, 16} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 18, 1, 5} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 9, 18} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 15} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {2, 14} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 5} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {13, 10} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
