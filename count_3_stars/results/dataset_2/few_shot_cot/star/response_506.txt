Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 11, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 0, 5, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 9, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 13, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 11, 6, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 14, 0, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 9, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
