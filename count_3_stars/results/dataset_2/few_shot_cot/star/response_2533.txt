Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2)

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 8, 6, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
