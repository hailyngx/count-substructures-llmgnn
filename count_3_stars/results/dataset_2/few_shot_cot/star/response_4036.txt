Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {26, 17, 5, 29} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 16, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 23, 22} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {25, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 22: 10
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 26: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in your graph.
