Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 2, 10, 6} (5 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 14, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 2, 12} (4 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 11} (2 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 10} (3 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 14, 10, 13} (5 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 13, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)  
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 13, 6} (4 neighbors)  
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in the given graph.
