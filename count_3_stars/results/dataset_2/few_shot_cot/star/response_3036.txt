Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 15, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 19, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 15, 14, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {18, 6, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {18, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 17, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 13, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
- **Node 16**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {13, 6, 8, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 4, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
