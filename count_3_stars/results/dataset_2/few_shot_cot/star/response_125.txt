Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Sum up all the valid configuration counts:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
