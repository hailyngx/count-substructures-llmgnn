Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph by examining each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {26, 7, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {27, 0, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {20, 24} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 12, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {21, 23, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {25, 23, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 16, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {16, 27} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {28, 19, 22, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Calculations for other nodes follow similarly.

Summing up the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in the given graph.
