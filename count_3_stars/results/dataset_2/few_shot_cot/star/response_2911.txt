Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
