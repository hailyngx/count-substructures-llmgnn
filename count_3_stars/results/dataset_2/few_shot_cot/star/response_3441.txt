Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 10, 13, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10, 6, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 8, 12, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 7, 14, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 6, 2, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in your graph.
