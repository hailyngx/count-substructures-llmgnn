- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 93

Therefore, there are a total of [93] 3-stars in your graph.
