- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {12, 13, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 16, 10, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 10} (3 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 8, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
