Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 11, 4} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 3, 12, 14, 17} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 12, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 15, 1, 18} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 19} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 4, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 0} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 2, 18} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 16, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {2, 18} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {13, 17} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {16, 2} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {12, 6, 14} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 12} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
