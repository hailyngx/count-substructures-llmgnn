Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 0, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 13, 7, 14, 4} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 13, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 0, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 8, 13, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 2, 9, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
