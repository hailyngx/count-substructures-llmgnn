Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1

- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 4
