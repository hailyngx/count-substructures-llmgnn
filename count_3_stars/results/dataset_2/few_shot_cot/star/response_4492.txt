Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 11, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 6, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 10, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {14, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 11} (2 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 15, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {18, 7, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
