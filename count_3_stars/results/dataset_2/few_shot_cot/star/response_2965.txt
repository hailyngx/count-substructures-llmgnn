Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 6, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 14, 3, 11, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 6, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 0, 6, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 3, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 10, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 14, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 11, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
