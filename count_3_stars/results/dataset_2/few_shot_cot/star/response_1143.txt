Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 5, and node 1

Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 9, 1, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 5, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 5, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 1, 0, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
