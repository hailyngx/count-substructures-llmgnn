Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 8, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 6, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
