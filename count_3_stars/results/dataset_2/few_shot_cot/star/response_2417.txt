Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 0, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
