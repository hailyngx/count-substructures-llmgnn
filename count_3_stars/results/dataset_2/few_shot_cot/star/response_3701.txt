Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <0, (5, 8, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <1, (6, 3, 4)>, <1, (6, 3, 8)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 0)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <2, (9, 6, 7)>, <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 7, 0)>, <2, (6, 7, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, <3, (6, 7, 4)>, <3, (1, 7, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 1, 7)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>, <4, (5, 3, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 0)>, <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (2, 4, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <6, (9, 7, 3)>, <6, (9, 7, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 7, 3)>, <6, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 2)>, <6, (7, 3, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <7, (6, 3, 4)>, <7, (6, 3, 2)>, <7, (6, 4, 2)>, <7, (3, 4, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <8, (1, 4, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <9, (5, 6, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
