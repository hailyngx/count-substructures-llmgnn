Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 11, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 14, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 12, 10, 2, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 14, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 73

Therefore, there are a total of [73] 3-stars in your graph.
