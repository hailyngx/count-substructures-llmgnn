Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {21, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (0, 21, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 28, 25} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <2, (8, 28, 25)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {20, 27, 14, 22} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (20, 27, 14)>, <3, (20, 27, 22)>, <3, (20, 14, 22)>, <3, (27, 14, 22)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 28} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 25} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 26, 25, 23} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <7, (1, 13, 26)>, <7, (1, 13, 25)>, <7, (1, 13, 23)>, <7, (1, 26, 25)>, <7, (1, 26, 23)>, <7, (1, 25, 23)>, <7, (13, 26, 25)>, <7, (13, 26, 23)>, <7, (13, 25, 23)>, <7, (26, 25, 23)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 25} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <8, (13, 2, 25)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {16, 21, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <9, (16, 21, 14)>
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16, 15, 18, 24} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {28, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {21, 4, 29, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
