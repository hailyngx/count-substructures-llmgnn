Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 0, 9, 5, 8} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 2, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 2, 9, 6} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
