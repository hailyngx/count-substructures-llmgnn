Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1

- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
