Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the provided graph by following the method described in the example:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 15, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - <1, (8, 15, 19)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 7, 16} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - <2, (11, 13, 7)>, <2, (11, 13, 16)>, <2, (11, 7, 16)>, <2, (13, 7, 16)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 16, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - <3, (8, 5, 16)>, <3, (8, 5, 18)>, <3, (8, 16, 18)>, <3, (5, 16, 18)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 16} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - <4, (14, 12, 16)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {14, 11, 13, 12, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
    - <5, (14, 11, 13)>, <5, (14, 11, 12)>, <5, (14, 11, 3)>, <5, (14, 13, 12)>, <5, (14, 13, 3)>, <5, (14, 12, 3)>, <5, (11, 13, 12)>, <5, (11, 13, 3)>, <5, (11, 12, 3)>, <5, (13, 12, 3)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 15} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {18, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - <7, (18, 2, 9)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - <8, (6, 3, 1)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 15, 16, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - <9, (7, 15, 16)>, <9, (7, 15, 19)>, <9, (7, 16, 19)>, <9, (15, 16, 19)>

- Remaining nodes do not have enough neighbors to form 3-stars.

Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 26

Therefore, there are a total of [26] 3-stars in the graph provided.
