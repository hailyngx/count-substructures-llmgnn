Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 28: 1
