Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 17, 1, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
