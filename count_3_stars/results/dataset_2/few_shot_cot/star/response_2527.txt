Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 10, 12, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 11, 12, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 9, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 5, 2, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 13, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 5, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 14, 1, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 11, 12, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 85

Therefore, there are a total of [85] 3-stars in your graph.
