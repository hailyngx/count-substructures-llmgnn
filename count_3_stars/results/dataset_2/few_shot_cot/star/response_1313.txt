Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1)

Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 5, 9, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 3, 2, 8} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 67

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in your graph.
