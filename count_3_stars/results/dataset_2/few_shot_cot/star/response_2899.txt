Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
