Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2, 13, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 18, 13, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {17, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 16, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 15, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 7, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 11} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in this graph.
