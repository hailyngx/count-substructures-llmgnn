Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
