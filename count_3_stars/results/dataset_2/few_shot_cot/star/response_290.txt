Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <2, (4, 7, 8)>; <2, (4, 7, 5)>; <2, (4, 8, 5)>; <2, (7, 8, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <3, (7, 9, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <4, (7, 8, 6)>; <4, (7, 8, 2)>; <4, (7, 6, 2)>; <4, (8, 6, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <5, (3, 6, 2)>; <5, (3, 6, 0)>; <5, (3, 2, 0)>; <5, (6, 2, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9, 5, 8, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - <6, (4, 7, 9)>; <6, (4, 7, 5)>; <6, (4, 7, 8)>; <6, (4, 9, 5)>; <6, (4, 9, 8)>; <6, (4, 5, 8)>; <6, (7, 9, 5)>; <6, (7, 9, 8)>; <6, (7, 5, 8)>; <6, (9, 5, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 9, 2, 1} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - <7, (4, 3, 6)>; <7, (4, 3, 9)>; <7, (4, 3, 2)>; <7, (4, 3, 1)>; <7, (4, 6, 9)>; <7, (4, 6, 2)>; <7, (4, 6, 1)>; <7, (4, 9, 2)>; <7, (4, 9, 1)>; <7, (4, 2, 1)>; and many more
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <8, (4, 6, 9)>; <8, (4, 6, 2)>; <8, (4, 9, 2)>; <8, (6, 9, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <9, (7, 1, 3)>; <9, (7, 1, 6)>; <9, (7, 1, 8)>; <9, (7, 3, 6)>; <9, (7, 3, 8)>; <9, (7, 6, 8)>; <9, (1, 3, 6)>; <9, (1, 3, 8)>; <9, (1, 6, 8)>; <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 71

Therefore, there are a total of [71] 3-stars in your graph.
