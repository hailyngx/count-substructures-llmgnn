Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2)

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the combinatorial formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each node that has at least three neighbors. 

Here is the breakdown for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
