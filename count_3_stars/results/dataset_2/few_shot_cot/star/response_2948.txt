Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 17, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 18, 13, 3, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 12, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 17, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 19, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 2, 19} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {4, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 14, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
