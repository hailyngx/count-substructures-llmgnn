Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 3, 8)>, <0, (6, 3, 2)>, <0, (6, 8, 2)>, <0, (3, 8, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (9, 6, 4)>, <2, (9, 6, 7)>, <2, (9, 6, 0)>, <2, (9, 4, 7)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>, <2, (9, 7, 0)>, <2, (6, 4, 7)>, <2, (6, 4, 0)>, <2, (6, 7, 0)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (6, 1, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 0, 8)>, <3, (1, 0, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 2, 8, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 2)>, <6, (5, 9, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (3, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 0)>, <6, (5, 2, 0)>, <6, (5, 8, 0)>, <6, (9, 3, 0)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (3, 2, 0)>, <6, (3, 8, 0)>, <6, (2, 8, 0)>, <6, (3, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3, 4, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 9, 3)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (5, 9, 0)>, <8, (5, 6, 3)>, <8, (5, 6, 4)>, <8, (5, 6, 0)>, <8, (5, 3, 4)>, <8, (5, 3, 0)>, <8, (5, 4, 0)>, <8, (9, 6, 3)>, <8, (9, 6, 4)>, <8, (9, 6, 0)>, <8, (9, 3, 4)>, <8, (9, 3, 0)>, <8, (9, 4, 0)>, <8, (6, 3, 4)>, <8, (6, 3, 0)>, <8, (6, 4, 0)>, <8, (3, 4, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 4, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
