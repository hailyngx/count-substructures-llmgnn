Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
