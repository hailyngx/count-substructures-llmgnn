Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 6)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
