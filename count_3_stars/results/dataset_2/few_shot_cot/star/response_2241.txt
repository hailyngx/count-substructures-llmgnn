Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will perform calculations for each node that has three or more neighbors. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, it can be the center of exactly one 3-star. 

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 25, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 13, 24} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 29, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {16, 20, 27, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 28, 9, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 21, 22, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {11, 28, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 4, 26} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {16, 20, 29} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {12, 28} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 20**: Neighbors = {25, 26, 13, 18, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 21**: Neighbors = {12, 27, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 22**: Neighbors = {12, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 23**: Neighbors = {14, 24, 28, 27} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 24**: Neighbors = {25, 23, 9, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 25**: Neighbors = {20, 0, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 26**: Neighbors = {16, 14, 20} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 27**: Neighbors = {23, 4, 21} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 28**: Neighbors = {11, 23, 19, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {13, 18, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
- From nodes with 4 neighbors: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16
- From nodes with 5 neighbors: 10 + 10 = 20

Total number of 3-stars = 5 + 16 + 20 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in the given graph.
