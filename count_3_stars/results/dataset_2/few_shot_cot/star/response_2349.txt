Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 6, 9, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 9, 13, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 1, 3, 8, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 14, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 3, 6, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 71

Therefore, there are a total of [71] 3-stars in your graph.
