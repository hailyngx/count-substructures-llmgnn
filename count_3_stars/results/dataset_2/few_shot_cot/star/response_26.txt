Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 10, 11, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 13, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 11, 7, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 7, 4, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 12, 4, 11, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 20
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 73

Therefore, there are a total of [73] 3-stars in your graph.
