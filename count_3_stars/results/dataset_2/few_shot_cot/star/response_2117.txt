Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 18, 0, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 12, 17, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16, 2, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 4, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16, 0, 14, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {18, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
