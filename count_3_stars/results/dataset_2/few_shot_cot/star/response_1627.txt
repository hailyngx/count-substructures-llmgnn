Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18: 1 3-star each
- From Node 7: 10 3-stars
- From Node 17: 10 3-stars
Total number of 3-stars = 13 * 1 (from individual nodes) + 10 (from node 7) + 10 (from node 17) = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
