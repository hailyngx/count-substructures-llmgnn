Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 9, 7)>, <0, (5, 9, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (9, 7, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 3, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (9, 6, 3)>, <2, (9, 6, 8)>, <2, (9, 3, 8)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 7, 2)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (7, 2, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 1)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 1, 7)>, <4, (6, 1, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 0, 7)>, <5, (4, 0, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (9, 7, 2)>, <6, (9, 7, 4)>, <6, (9, 2, 4)>, <6, (7, 2, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 4)>, <7, (5, 6, 0)>, <7, (5, 3, 4)>, <7, (5, 3, 0)>, <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (6, 3, 4)>, <7, (6, 3, 0)>, <7, (6, 4, 0)>, <7, (3, 4, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <8, (9, 3, 0)>, <8, (9, 2, 0)>, <8, (3, 2, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (8, 2, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
