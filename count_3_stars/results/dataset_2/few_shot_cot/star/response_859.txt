Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 4
