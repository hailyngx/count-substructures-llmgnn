Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 15, 12, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {17, 18, 12, 13, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 18, 19, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 15, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14, 6, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
