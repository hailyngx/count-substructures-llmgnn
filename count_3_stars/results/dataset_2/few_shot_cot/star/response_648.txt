Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 10, 3, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 11, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 18, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 19} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 47

Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
