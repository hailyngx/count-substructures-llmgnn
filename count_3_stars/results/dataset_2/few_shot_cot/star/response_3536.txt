Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2)

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3, 7, 2} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 7, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 7, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
