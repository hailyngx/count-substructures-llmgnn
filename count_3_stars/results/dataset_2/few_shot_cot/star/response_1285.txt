Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will now calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph by following the approach explained in the example.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 10, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 7, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11, 12, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {14, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 11, 5, 14, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 3, 1, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 13, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in the given graph.
