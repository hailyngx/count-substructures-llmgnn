Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 15, 9, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 10, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 19, 9, 17} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 4, 19, 18} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 7, 0, 18, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {16, 8, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {14, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 19, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 17, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 17, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
