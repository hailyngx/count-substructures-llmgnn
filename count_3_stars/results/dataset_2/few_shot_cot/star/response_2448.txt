Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
