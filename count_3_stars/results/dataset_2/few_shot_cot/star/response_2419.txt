Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 7, 12, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 13, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 7, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 10, 14, 4, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 5, 13, 2, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 5, 12, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 4, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 93

Therefore, there are a total of [93] 3-stars in your graph.
