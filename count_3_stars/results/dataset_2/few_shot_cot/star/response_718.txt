Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 8, 0, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 20
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
  - From Node 0: 1
  - From Node 1: 1
  - From Node 2: 10
  - From Node 3: 20
  - From Node 4: 4
  - From Node 6: 4
  - From Node 7: 10
  - From Node 8: 4
  - From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
