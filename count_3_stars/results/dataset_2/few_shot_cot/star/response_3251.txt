Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 56
