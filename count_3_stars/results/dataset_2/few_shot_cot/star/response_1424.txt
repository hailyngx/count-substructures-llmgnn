Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 8, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 14, 10, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 0, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 11, 6, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 1, 11, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
