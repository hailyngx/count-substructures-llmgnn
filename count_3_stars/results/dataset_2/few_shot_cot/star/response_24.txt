Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 12, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 12, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 12, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 3, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 7, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
