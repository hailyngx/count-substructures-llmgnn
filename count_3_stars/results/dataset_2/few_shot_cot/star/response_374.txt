Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 28, 25, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 20, 25} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {24} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
