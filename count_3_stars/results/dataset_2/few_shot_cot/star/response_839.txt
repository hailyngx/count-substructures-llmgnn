Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <1, (6, 7, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars: 
    - <2, (9, 6, 4)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 6)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 8)>
    - <2, (6, 4, 1)>
    - <2, (6, 4, 8)>
    - <2, (6, 1, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <3, (5, 9, 7)>
    - <3, (5, 0, 8)>
    - <3, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (9, 7, 0)>
    - <3, (9, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (7, 0, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 3, 1, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <7, (5, 9, 4)>
    - <7, (5, 3, 8)>
    - <7, (5, 1, 8)>
    - <7, (9, 4, 3)>
    - <7, (9, 4, 8)>
    - <7, (9, 3, 8)>
    - <7, (4, 3, 8)>
    - <7, (4, 1, 8)>
    - <7, (3, 1, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <8, (4, 7, 3)>
    - <8, (4, 7, 2)>
    - <8, (4, 3, 2)>
    - <8, (4, 3, 0)>
    - <8, (7, 3, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <9, (6, 4, 2)>
    - <9, (6, 4, 7)>
    - <9, (6, 2, 7)>
    - <9, (4, 2, 3)>
    - <9, (4, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
