Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 18, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 16, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 18, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 4, 16} (4 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
