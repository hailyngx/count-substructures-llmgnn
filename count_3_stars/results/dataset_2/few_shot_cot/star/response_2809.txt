Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
