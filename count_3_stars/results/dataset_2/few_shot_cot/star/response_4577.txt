Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 6, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - <0, (1, 6, 12)>, <0, (1, 6, 11)>, <0, (12, 6, 11)>, <0, (1, 12, 6)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in the provided graph.
