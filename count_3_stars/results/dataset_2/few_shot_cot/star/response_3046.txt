Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (7, 5, 6)>, <2, (7, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (7, 5, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 9, 2, 8, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
