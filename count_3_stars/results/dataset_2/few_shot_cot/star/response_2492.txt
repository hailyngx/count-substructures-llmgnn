Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {21, 29, 20, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
