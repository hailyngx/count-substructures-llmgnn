Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2)

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 5, 4} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 5, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
