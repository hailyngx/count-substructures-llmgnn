Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors. Cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 15, 16, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 13, 17} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 16, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 19, 17} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {18, 1, 15, 11} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 12, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {19, 14, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 1, 15} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 11, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 10, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 11, 16, 12} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
