Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 3, 16, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 12, 18} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
