Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 17, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {19, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14, 16, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 2, 18, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {8, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 18, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 18, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {17, 14, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
