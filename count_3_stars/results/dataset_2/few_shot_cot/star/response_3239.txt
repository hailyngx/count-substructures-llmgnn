Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 10, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 10, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 3, 11, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 13, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 5, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 9, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 13, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 64
Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
