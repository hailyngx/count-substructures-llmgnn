Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
From the valid configurations calculated above:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
