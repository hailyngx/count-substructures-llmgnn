Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {20, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 18, 19, 10, 25} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 29, 26} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
