Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 12, 14} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 10, 11, 0} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)   
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 11, 14} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 10, 13, 1} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)   
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {12, 1} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.   
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)   
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)   
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 10, 0} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)   
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)   

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:   
Add up all the valid configurations:   
- From Node 0: 4  
- From Node 1: 10  
- From Node 2: 4  
- From Node 3: 10  
- From Node 4: 10  
- From Node 5: 10  
- From Node 7: 10  
- From Node 9: 4  
- From Node 10: 4  
- From Node 11: 1   
- From Node 12: 4   
- From Node 13: 10   
- From Node 14: 4   

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 85   

Therefore, there are a total of [85] 3-stars in your graph.
