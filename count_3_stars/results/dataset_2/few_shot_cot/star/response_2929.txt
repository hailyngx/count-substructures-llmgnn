Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 12, 8} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
