Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 10, 19} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 1, 15} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 15, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 17, 7} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 7, 5, 17} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 15, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {16, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
