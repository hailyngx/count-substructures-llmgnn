Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 11, 13, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 14, 13, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 1, 11, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 11, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 11, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {12, 14, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 6, 0, 9, 13} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 10, 6, 1, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 11, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 9, 2, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 91

Therefore, there are a total of [91] 3-stars in the given graph.
