Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in the graph.
