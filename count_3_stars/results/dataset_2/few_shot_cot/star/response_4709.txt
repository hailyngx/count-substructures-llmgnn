Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 15, 16, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 15, 12, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 17, 18, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 18, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 3, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 1, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
