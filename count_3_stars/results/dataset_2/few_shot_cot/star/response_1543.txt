Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 15, 17} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 13} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 19} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 12} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 10, 16} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 14} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 17} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 16, 15, 14} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 10} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {17, 10} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 16, 18} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 18} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 17} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {7, 4, 12, 18} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 9, 18, 15} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 16, 17} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations calculated above:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
