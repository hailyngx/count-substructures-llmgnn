Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 0, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
