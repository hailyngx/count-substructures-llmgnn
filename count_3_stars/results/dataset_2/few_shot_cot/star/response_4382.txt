Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars based on the configuration around each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 11, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
