Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 14, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {18, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 7, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 1, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 0, 6, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 15} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
