Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 4, 0, 8} (6 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 3, 8} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 4, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
       
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 1: 20
        - From Node 2: 4
        - From Node 3: 4
        - From Node 4: 10
        - From Node 5: 4
        - From Node 6: 4
        - From Node 8: 20
        - From Node 9: 1
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 68
        
        Therefore, there are a total of [68] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
