Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
