Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11, 12, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 10, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 8, 4, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 11, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 1, 6, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 11, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 2, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations together:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
