Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {26, 14, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 26, 17, 27} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
