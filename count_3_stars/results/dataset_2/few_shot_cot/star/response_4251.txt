Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (2, 8, 7)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <1, (5, 9, 7)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (8, 0, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <4, (5, 9, 6)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <5, (8, 1, 4)> <5, (1, 4, 7)> <5, (4, 7, 9)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (2, 4, 0)> <6, (4, 0, 3)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <7, (9, 1, 2)> <7, (1, 2, 0)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <8, (9, 3, 2)> <8, (3, 2, 0)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <9, (8, 4, 1)> <9, (4, 1, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 3
- From Node 6: 2
- From Node 7: 2
- From Node 8: 2
- From Node 9: 2

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
