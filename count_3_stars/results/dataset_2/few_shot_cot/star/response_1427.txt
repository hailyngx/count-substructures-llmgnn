Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (9, 7, 4)> 
  - <0, (9, 7, 1)>
  - <0, (9, 4, 1)>
  - <0, (7, 4, 1)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (2, 0, 7)>
  - <1, (2, 0, 4)>
  - <1, (2, 7, 4)>
  - <1, (0, 7, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)

  - <2, (5, 1, 4)>
  - <2, (9, 1, 4)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <3, (5, 8, 7)>
  - <3, (6, 8, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 0, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (9, 6, 2)>
  - <4, (9, 6, 0)>
  - <4, (9, 6, 1)>

  - <4, (6, 0, 1)>
  - <4, (2, 0, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <5, (9, 2, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)

  - <6, (9, 3, 8)>
  - <6, (9, 3, 4)>
  - <6, (9, 8, 4)>
  - <6, (3, 8, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (9, 0, 3)>
  - <7, (9, 0, 1)>
  - <7, (9, 3, 1)>
  - <7, (0, 3, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 2, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <9, (5, 6, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
