Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the count of valid configurations from each node:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in the given graph.
