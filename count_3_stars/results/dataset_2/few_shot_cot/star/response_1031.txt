Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
