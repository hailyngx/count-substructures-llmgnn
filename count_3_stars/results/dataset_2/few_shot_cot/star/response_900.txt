Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 15
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 15 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 78

Therefore, there are a total of [78] 3-stars in your graph.
