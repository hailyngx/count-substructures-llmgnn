Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 19} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 6, 19, 15} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 13} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 5, 17} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 15} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 19, 5} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17, 18} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {15, 18} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 2} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 0, 4} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 17, 13} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 3} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 1} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 12} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 35
Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
