Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 10
