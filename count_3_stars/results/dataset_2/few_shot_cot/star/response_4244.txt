Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {20, 10, 24, 29, 22} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 24, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {19, 26, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 10
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 10
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 71

Therefore, there are a total of [71] 3-stars in your graph.
