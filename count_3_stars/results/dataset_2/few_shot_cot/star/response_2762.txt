Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 37
