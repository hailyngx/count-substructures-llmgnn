Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 10, 12, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9, 10, 11, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 9, 12, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 14, 2, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 4, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 0, 2, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 5, 14, 2, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 4, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
