Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 21} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 24, 7} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 6, 10, 12, 23} (5 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 18} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {29, 14, 23} (3 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {28, 2, 27, 19} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 20**: Neighbors = {25, 7, 26, 9} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 21**: Neighbors = {28, 0, 10, 22} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 22**: Neighbors = {29, 21, 16} (3 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 22} (3 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 10
- From Node 25: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
