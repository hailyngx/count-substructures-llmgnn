Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
   - <1, (11, 6, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 0, 10, 15} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
   - <2, (11, 0, 10)>, <2, (11, 0, 15)>, <2, (11, 10, 15)>, <2, (5, 0, 10)>, <2, (5, 0, 15)>, <2, (5, 10, 15)>, <2, (0, 10, 15)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 17} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
