Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 3, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 2, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
