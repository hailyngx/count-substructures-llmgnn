Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 10
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
