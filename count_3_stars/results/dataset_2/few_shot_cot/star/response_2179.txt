Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 17, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 18, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 10, 2, 9, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 10} (2 neighbors)

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 19} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 11, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 11, 8, 16} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
