Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {18, 11, 15} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 10} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 17} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 11, 6} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 14} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 19} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 19, 16, 14, 9} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {13, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 7, 0, 4} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 6, 14, 9} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 10, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {7, 4} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 3: 1
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 6: 1
        - From Node 7: 10
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 1
        - From Node 10: 4
        - From Node 11: 10
        - From Node 12: 10
        - From Node 13: 1
        - From Node 14: 4
        - From Node 19: 1
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 45
        Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
