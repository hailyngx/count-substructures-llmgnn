Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 4, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
