Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (2, 3, 1)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 1, 6)>, <0, (3, 1, 6)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 4)>, <1, (0, 9, 4)>, <1, (7, 9, 4)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 2, 8, 7, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 7)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 7)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>,
  <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 7, 9)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (2, 1, 9)>, <4, (2, 1, 3)>, <4, (2, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 9, 3)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 9, 0)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (8, 3, 1)>, <7, (8, 3, 6)>, <7, (8, 1, 6)>, <7, (3, 1, 6)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <8, (2, 7, 3)>, <8, (2, 7, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (7, 3, 5)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 6)>, <9, (4, 1, 6)>, <9, (3, 1, 6)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
From the calculations above:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
