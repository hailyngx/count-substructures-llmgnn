Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node: 

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 13, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 10, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
    - 3-Star: <4, (6, 14, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 11, 4, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 11, 4} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has exactly 3 neighbors.
    - 3-Star: <7, (9, 1, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 11} (2 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 14, 10, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 8, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 10, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 0, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 11: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
