Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 0, 11, 14} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 12} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 2, 11, 10, 14} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3, 4, 8, 13} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 11, 10, 3} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8, 12, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 13, 10, 0, 11} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 5, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 110

Therefore, there are a total of [110] 3-stars in your graph.
