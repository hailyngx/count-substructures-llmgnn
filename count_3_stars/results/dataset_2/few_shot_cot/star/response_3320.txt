Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node: 
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 2, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 12, 0, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 12, 10, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 11, 10, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 4, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 11, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the valid configurations from each node:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
