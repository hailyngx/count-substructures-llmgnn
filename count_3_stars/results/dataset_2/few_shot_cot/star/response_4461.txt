Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
