Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
