Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (3, 2, 4)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 4, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (6, 1, 4)>, <2, (6, 1, 7)>, <2, (6, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 2, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (5, 1, 7)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 1, 4)>, <3, (5, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 2, 7)>, <3, (4, 2, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 4, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 8)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (8, 4, 7)>, <5, (8, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 2, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (3, 2, 4)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
