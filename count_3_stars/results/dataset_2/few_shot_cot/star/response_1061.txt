Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 19} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 13} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 6} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 0} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 12, 2, 3} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 15} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 1} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 1} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {16, 11, 1} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 15, 2} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 1  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 6: 10  
- From Node 8: 1  
- From Node 10: 1  
- From Node 11: 4  
- From Node 13: 1  
- From Node 14: 1  
- From Node 15: 4  
- From Node 16: 1  
- From Node 17: 4  
- From Node 18: 1  
- From Node 19: 1  
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 35  
Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
