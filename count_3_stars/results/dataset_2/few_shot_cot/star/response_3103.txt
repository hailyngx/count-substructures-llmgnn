Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4

- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4

- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
