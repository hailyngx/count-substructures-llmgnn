Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {26} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 14, 4, 25} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
