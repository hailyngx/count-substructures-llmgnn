Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 4, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 4, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
