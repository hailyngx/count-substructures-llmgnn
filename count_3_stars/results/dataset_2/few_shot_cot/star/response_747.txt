Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node with three or more neighbors. 

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 14, 13, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 0, 14, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(6, 3) = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 12, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 12, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 13, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 2, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 10, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)

Total Number of 3-Stars: 
Adding up all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in your graph is [73].
