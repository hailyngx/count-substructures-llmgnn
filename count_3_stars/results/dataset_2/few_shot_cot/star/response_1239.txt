Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1

- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
