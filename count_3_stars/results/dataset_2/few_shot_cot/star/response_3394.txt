Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <0, (5, 2, 1)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 5, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <1, (9, 4, 5)>, <1, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (9, 5, 2)>, <1, (4, 5, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 2)>, <1, (4, 0, 2)>, <1, (5, 0, 2)>, <1, (9, 4, 0)>, <1, (9, 0, 2)>, <1, (4, 0, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 1, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <2, (4, 0, 1)>, <2, (4, 0, 3)>, <2, (4, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (4, 1, 7)>, <2, (4, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (6, 9, 8)>, <3, (6, 9, 2)>, <3, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (6, 8, 2)>, <3, (6, 8, 7)>, <3, (6, 2, 7)>, <3, (9, 8, 2)>, <3, (9, 8, 7)>, <3, (9, 2, 7)>, <3, (8, 2, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 5, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (9, 8, 5)>, <4, (9, 8, 1)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 5, 1)>, <4, (9, 5, 2)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 1)>, <4, (8, 5, 2)>, <4, (8, 1, 2)>, <4, (5, 1, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (6, 4, 1)>, <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (4, 1, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <8, (6, 4, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (6, 4, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <9, (6, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
