Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (7, 9, 3)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (1, 2, 3)>, <1, (9, 7, 4)>, <1, (9, 4, 3)>, <1, (9, 3, 8)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (7, 9, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 0, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 3, 5)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 8)>, <7, (4, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (9, 3, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 3, 2, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 2, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 8)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 4)>, <8, (7, 9, 3)>, <8, (7, 9, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 8)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
