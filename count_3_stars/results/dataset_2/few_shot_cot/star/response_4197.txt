Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
    <0, (2, 7, 4)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
    <1, (2, 8, 7)>, <1, (2, 8, 4)>, <1, (2, 7, 4)>, <1, (8, 7, 4)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 4, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
    <2, (9, 8, 4)>, <2, (9, 8, 1)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>, <2, (9, 1, 0)>, <2, (8, 4, 1)>, <2, (8, 4, 0)>, <2, (8, 1, 0)>, <2, (4, 1, 0)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
    <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (5, 8, 7)>, <3, (9, 8, 7)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 0, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
    <4, (9, 6, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (9, 6, 1)>, <4, (9, 2, 0)>, <4, (9, 2, 1)>, <4, (9, 0, 1)>, <4, (6, 2, 0)>, <4, (6, 2, 1)>, <4, (6, 0, 1)>, <4, (2, 0, 1)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
    <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (8, 3, 7)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
    <7, (5, 9, 0)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 1)>, <7, (5, 0, 3)>, <7, (5, 0, 1)>, <7, (5, 3, 1)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 1)>, <7, (9, 3, 1)>, <7, (0, 3, 1)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
    <8, (5, 2, 3)>, <8, (5, 2, 1)>, <8, (5, 3, 1)>, <8, (2, 3, 1)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
    <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 2, 3)>, <9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
