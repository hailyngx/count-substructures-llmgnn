Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 6, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 10, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 1, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 0, 6, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 11, 14, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 11, 12, 13, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 1, 6, 8, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
