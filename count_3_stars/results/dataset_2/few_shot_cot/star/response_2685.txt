Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 16, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {18, 0, 14, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 8, 17, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 5} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 4, 19} (4 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {4, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
