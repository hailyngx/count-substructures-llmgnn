Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 7, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 15, 19, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 15, 12} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 2, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {19, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
