Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {19, 5, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 17, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 19} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 16, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 18} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
