Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we will analyze each node based on the adjacency list given and calculate the number of 3-star configurations for nodes with three or more neighbors.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 18, 26} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {26, 13, 9, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 27, 20, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
