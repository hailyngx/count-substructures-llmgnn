Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 11, 9, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 19, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 18, 2} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 3, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 18} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
