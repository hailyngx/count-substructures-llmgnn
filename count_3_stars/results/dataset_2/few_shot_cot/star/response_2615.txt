Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 13, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 2, 5, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 12, 11, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 7, 8, 12, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 0
- From Node 5: 0
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 0
- From Node 11: 0
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 0
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 20 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
