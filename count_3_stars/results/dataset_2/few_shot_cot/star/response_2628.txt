Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 11, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 4, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 17, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 13, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 12, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 16, 11, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 1, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 2, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {19, 11, 16} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {10, 6, 1, 18, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 
Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
