Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph. These are the unique 3-star subgraphs that can be formed based on the given adjacency list.
