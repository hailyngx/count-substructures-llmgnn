Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 10
