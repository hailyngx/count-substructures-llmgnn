Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 0, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12, 5, 1, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 13, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 3, 1, 0, 8} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 13, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8, 5, 12, 3} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 20
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 94

Therefore, there are a total of [94] 3-stars in your graph.
