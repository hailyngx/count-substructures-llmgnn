Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {20, 7, 9, 29} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {22, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
