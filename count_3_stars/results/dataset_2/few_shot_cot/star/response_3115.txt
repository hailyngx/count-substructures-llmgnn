Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph by following the method outlined in the example:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 5, 0, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-stars: <1, (6, 5, 0)>, <1, (6, 5, 12)>, <1, (5, 0, 12)>, <1, (6, 0, 12)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 3, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-stars: <5, (8, 3, 1)>, <5, (8, 3, 0)>, <5, (8, 1, 0)>, <5, (3, 1, 0)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 12, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 10, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-stars: <7, (4, 3, 10)>, <7, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (4, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 10, 8)>, <7, (3, 10, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 2, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-stars: <8, (7, 13, 2)>, <8, (7, 13, 5)>, <8, (7, 13, 1)>, <8, (7, 2, 5)>, <8, (13, 2, 5)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 10, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-stars: <11, (9, 10, 14)>, <11, (9, 10, 13)>, <11, (9, 14, 13)>, <11, (10, 14, 13)>, <11, (4, 10, 13)>

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 1, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-stars: <12, (2, 3, 14)>, <12, (2, 3, 1)>, <12, (2, 3, 6)>, <12, (2, 14, 6)>, <12, (3, 1, 6)>

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
4 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 2) + 4 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 6) + 10 (from Node 7) + 10 (from Node 8) + 4 (from Node 10) + 10 (from Node 11) + 10 (from Node 12) + 1 (from Node 13) + 1 (from Node 14) = 83

Therefore, there are a total of [83] 3-stars in your graph.
