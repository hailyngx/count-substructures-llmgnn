Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 7, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 1} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 19, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 5, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 19} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 15, 13, 19} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16, 12, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 14, 9, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {8, 17, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4  = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
