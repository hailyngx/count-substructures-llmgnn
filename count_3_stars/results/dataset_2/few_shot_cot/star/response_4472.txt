Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Summing up the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
