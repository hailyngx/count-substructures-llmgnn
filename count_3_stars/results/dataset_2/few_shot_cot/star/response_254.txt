Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 5, 14, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{5}{3} = 10´
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{4}{3} = 4´
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 5, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{4}{3} = 4´
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 9, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{4}{3} = 4´
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 0, 3, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{5}{3} = 10´
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{4}{3} = 4´
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{4}{3} = 4´
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{4}{3} = 4´
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 11, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{4}{3} = 4´
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 13, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{5}{3} = 10´
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 0, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: ´inom{5}{3} = 10´

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10
Therefore, there are a total of [68] 3-stars in your graph.
