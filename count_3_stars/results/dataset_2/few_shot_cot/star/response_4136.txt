Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 10, 11, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 11, 6, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 14, 2, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 10, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 7, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 0, 13, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 14, 7, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 8, 12, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 88

Therefore, there are a total of [88] 3-stars in your graph.
