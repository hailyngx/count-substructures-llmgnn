Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 10, 3, 0, 14} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 10, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 8, 13, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 12, 3, 14} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
