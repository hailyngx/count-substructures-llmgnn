Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 14, 9)>, <1, (5, 14, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 14)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 19, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {16, 0, 19, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <6, (16, 0, 19)>, <6, (16, 0, 18)>, <6, (16, 19, 18)>, <6, (0, 19, 18)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 1, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <9, (0, 19, 1)>, <9, (0, 19, 18)>, <9, (0, 1, 18)>, <9, (19, 1, 18)>
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 18, 7} (3 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 17, 10, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <13, (8, 17, 10)>, <13, (8, 17, 15)>, <13, (8, 10, 15)>, <13, (17, 10, 15)>
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {13, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <19, (2, 6, 12)>, <19, (2, 6, 9)>, <19, (2, 12, 9)>, <19, (6, 12, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
