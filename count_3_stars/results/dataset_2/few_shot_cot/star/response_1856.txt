Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node: 

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {22, 1}
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {21, 11, 0, 12, 8} 
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {23, 20, 16} 
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
