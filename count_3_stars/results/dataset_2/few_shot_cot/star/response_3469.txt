Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 18, 13, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 5, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 7, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {15, 6, 14, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {18, 7, 8, 13, 16} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {14, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
