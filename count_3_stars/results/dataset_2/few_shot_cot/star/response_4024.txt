Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 10, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 5, 6, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 2, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 0, 6, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 4, 12, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 6, 8, 7, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 93

Therefore, there are a total of [93] 3-stars in your graph.
