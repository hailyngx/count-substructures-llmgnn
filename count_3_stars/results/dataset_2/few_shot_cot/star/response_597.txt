Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 2, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 3, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
