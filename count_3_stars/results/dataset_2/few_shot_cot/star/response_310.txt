Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
