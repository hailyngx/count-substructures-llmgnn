Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 83

Therefore, there are a total of [83] 3-stars in your graph.
