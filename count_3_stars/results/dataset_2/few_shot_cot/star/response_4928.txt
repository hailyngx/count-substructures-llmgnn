Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 17, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 14, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 16, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 11, 17} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
