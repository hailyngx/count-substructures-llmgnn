Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 8, 0, 2} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 2, 1, 7} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
