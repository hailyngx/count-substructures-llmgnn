Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7)

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 1, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 6, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
