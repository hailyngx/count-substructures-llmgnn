Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 6, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 1, 14, 3, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 0, 6, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 10, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 12, 14, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 6, 12, 2, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 101

Therefore, there are a total of [101] 3-stars in the graph provided.
