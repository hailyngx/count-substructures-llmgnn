Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 14, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 10, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 14, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 10, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 11, 12, 2} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 1, 12, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 90

Therefore, there are a total of [90] 3-stars in your graph.
