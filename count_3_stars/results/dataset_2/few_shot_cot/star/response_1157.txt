Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 6, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 0, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {12, 6, 0, 10, 8, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 11, 4, 0, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 1, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 92

Therefore, there are a total of [92] 3-stars in your graph.
