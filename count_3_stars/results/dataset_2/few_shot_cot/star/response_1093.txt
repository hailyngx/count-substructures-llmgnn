Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4
