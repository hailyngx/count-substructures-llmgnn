Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 10, 4, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 11, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 11, 14, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 11, 4, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 8, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 5, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 13, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 0, 13, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 0, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 7, 10, 5} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 79

Therefore, there are a total of [79] 3-stars in your graph.
