Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 15, 1} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 17, 10, 18} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 11} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {19, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 15} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 18} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {13, 16, 11} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {2, 17, 19, 9} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 18, 15} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 14} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 3, 15} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {12, 9} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 11} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 12} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 4} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
