Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 9, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 2, 9, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 13, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9, 10, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 11, 6, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 13, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 2, 11, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6, 9, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
