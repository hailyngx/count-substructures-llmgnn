Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 11, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {19, 5, 14, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 11, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 18, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {12, 1, 8, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 0, 11} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 17, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: No neighbors
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
