Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 3, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 7, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 7, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 2, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 42
Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
