Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 15, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {19, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 18, 16, 15} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {18, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 11, 16, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 17, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {18, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star since it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 19, 16, 17} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
