Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{3}{3}} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 16, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{4}{3}} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 17, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{3}{3}} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{3}{3}} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 1, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{4}{3}} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {12, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{3}{3}} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 16, 19, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{4}{3}} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{4}{3}} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{3}{3}} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {16, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{3}{3}} = 1 \)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 15, 18, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{5}{3}} = 10 \)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {7, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {13, 19, 9, 16, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{5}{3}} = 10 \)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( {\binom{3}{3}} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
