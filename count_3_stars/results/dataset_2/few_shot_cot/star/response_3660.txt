Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node  
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 6} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 6} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 17} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 9, 14} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 19, 18} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 16, 3, 15, 14} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {19, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 16} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 16} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 17, 15} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 2} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 18, 16} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 12} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 9, 14} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {13, 3, 12} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {5, 14} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 15} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 5: 1  
- From Node 7: 10  
- From Node 8: 1  
- From Node 9: 1  
- From Node 10: 1  
- From Node 11: 1  
- From Node 12: 1  
- From Node 13: 1  
- From Node 14: 4  
- From Node 15: 1  
- From Node 16: 4  
- From Node 17: 1  
- From Node 19: 1  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 32  

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
