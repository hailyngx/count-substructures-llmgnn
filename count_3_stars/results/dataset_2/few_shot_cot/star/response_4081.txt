Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 8, 10, 11} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 19, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 16, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 12, 19, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {17, 18, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {19, 18, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 19, 16} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {14, 4, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {13, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {14, 13, 5, 2, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
