Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 5, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 0, 14, 1, 11} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11, 12, 8, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 3, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 10, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 12, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in your graph.
