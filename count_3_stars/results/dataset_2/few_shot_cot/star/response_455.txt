Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 61
