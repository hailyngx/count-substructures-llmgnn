Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 12, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 13, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 3, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 12, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 6, 7, 13, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 12, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 11, 7, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 73

Therefore, there are a total of [73] 3-stars in your graph.
