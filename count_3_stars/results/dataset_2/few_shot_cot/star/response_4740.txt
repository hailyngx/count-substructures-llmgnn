Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 8, 5, 3, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars formed:
    - <6, (4, 10, 8)>
    - <6, (4, 10, 5)>
    - <6, (8, 5, 3)>
    - <6, (5, 0, 12)>
    - <6, (3, 7, 13)>
    - <6, (2, 11, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 9, 6, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star formed:
    - <8, (11, 13, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 13, 5, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star formed:
    - <10, (11, 13, 5)>
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 14, 9, 2, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars formed:
    - <12, (4, 0, 14)>
    - <12, (0, 1, 8)>
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 8, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
