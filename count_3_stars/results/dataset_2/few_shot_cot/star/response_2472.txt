Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <0, (5, 9, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12, 18, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (12, 18, 2)>, <1, (12, 2, 13)>, <1, (18, 2, 13)>, <1, (12, 18, 13)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 7, 1} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
