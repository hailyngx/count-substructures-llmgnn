Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 18, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 18, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {16, 8, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
