Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 11, 4, 7, 14} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 11, 14, 10} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4, 8, 12} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 11, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 10, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 11, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 10, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 4, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
