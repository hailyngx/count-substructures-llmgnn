Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
