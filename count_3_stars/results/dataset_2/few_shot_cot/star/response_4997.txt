Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {26, 11, 28} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 11, 28} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 73

Therefore, there are a total of [73] 3-stars in your graph.
