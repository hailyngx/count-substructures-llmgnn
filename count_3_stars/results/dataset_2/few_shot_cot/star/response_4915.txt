Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 13, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 0, 14, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 10, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 8, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 12, 10, 9, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 13, 8, 4, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 13, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 2, 11, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 2, 10, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 101

Therefore, there are a total of [101] 3-stars in your graph.
