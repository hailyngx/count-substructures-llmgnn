Response:
Given the information provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph by examining each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 22, 13, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 0: 4

- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in the graph.
