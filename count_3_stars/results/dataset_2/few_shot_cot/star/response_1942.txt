Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 16, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 7, 19} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {17, 2, 14, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)

- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 12} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 11} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 15, 16, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
