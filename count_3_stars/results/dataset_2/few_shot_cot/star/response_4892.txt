Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 4
