Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1
