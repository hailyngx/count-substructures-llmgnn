Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 21: 4
