Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 16, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 15, 18} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
