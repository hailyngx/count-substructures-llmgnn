Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in your graph.
