Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 9, 18, 15} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
