Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 10
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 71

Therefore, there are a total of [71] 3-stars in your graph.
