Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list for each node provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 10, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 11, 13, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 7, 13, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 8, 0, 2, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 14, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 13, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
