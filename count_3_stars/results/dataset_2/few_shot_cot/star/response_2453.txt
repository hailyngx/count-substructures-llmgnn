Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (9, 7, 2)>, <0, (9, 7, 3)>, <0, (9, 2, 3)>, <0, (7, 2, 3)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <1, (5, 7, 2)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <2, (5, 9, 8)>, <2, (5, 9, 1)>, <2, (5, 8, 1)>, <2, (9, 8, 1)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>, <2, (5, 1, 0)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 1, 0)>, <2, (8, 1, 0)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <3, (5, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 4, 0)>, <3, (5, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 7, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, 6)>, <3, (5, 0, 6)>, <3, (7, 0, 6)>, <3, (4, 0, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 8, 1)>, <5, (2, 8, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (8, 1, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <6, (4, 8, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <7, (4, 0, 1)>, <7, (4, 3, 1)>, <7, (0, 3, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <8, (5, 2, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <9, (5, 2, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
