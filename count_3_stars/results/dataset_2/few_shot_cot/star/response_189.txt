Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 2, and node 7

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 2, 4, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in the given graph.
