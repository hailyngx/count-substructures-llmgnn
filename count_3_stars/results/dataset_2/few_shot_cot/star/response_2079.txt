Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <0, (4, 8, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <3, (4, 1, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 0, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-star: <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 0), <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <4, (5, 7, 1)>, <4, (5, 0, 3)>, <4, (5, 0, 1)>, <4, (5, 3, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 0)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 0, 3)>, <4, (9, 0, 1)>, <4, (9, 3, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 3)>, <4, (7, 0, 1)>, <4, (7, 3, 1)>, <4, (0, 3, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 2)>, <7, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
