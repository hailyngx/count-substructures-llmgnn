Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4)

Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1   
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 0, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10  

Adding up all the valid configurations:
- Node 0: 1  
- Node 1: 4  
- Node 2: 1  
- Node 3: 10  
- Node 4: 4  
- Node 5: 4  
- Node 7: 20  
- Node 8: 4  
- Node 9: 10  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
