Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 4, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 1, 0, 3} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 2, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 67

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in your graph.
