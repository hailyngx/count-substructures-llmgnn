Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 18, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 16, 5, 27} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
