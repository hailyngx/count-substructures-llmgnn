Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 19, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 17, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 0, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 17} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 18, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {16, 1, 19, 15, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 15} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
