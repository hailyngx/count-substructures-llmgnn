Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: 
        - <1, (5, 9, 6)>
        - <1, (5, 9, 0)>
        - <1, (5, 6, 0)>
        - <1, (9, 6, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Unique 3-stars: 
        - <2, (5, 4, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
