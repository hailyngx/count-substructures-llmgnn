Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 2, 7)>, <1, (4, 2, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (9, 8, 1)>, <2, (9, 8, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 3)>, <2, (8, 1, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (5, 2, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (8, 0, 1)>, <4, (8, 0, 6)>, <4, (8, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 1, 3, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 3)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (8, 1, 3)>, <5, (8, 1, 7)>, <5, (8, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (5, 4, 8)>, <6, (5, 4, 7)>, <6, (5, 8, 7)>, <6, (4, 8, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 1)>, <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 1)>, <7, (5, 3, 1)>, <7, (9, 6, 3)>, <7, (9, 6, 1)>, <7, (9, 3, 1)>, <7, (6, 3, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (5, 4, 2)>, <8, (5, 4, 6)>, <8, (5, 2, 6)>, <8, (4, 2, 6)>, <8, (5, 4, 0)>, <8, (5, 2, 0)>, <8, (5, 0, 6)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <8, (4, 0, 6)>, <8, (2, 0, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <9, (5, 2, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
