Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 5)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (3, 2, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 3, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <2, (6, 9, 1)>
    - <2, (6, 3, 4)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 3)>
    - <2, (9, 3, 4)>
    - <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 7, 2, 5} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: 
    - <3, (6, 9, 1)>
    - <3, (6, 1, 7)>
    - <3, (6, 7, 5)>
    - <3, (9, 1, 7)>
    - <3, (9, 7, 5)>
    - <3, (1, 7, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 5, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (8, 0, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 7, 8, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <5, (6, 3, 4)>
    - <5, (6, 4, 7)>
    - <5, (6, 7, 8)>
    - <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (5, 3, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 0, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (9, 4, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (8, 2, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
