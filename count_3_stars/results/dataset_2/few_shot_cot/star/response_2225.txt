Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 17, 1, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 13, 4, 18} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
