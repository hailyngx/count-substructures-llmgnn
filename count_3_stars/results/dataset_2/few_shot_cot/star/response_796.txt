Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 53
