Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 3, 5, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 5, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 6, 9, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 0, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
