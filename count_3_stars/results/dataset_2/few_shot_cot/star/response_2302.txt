Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars using the combinatorial formula and then sum up the total.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {25} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (13, 10, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 16, 21, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (15, 16, 21)>, <2, (15, 21, 14)>, <2, (16, 21, 14)>, <2, (15, 16, 14)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 28, 24, 29} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (13, 28, 24)>, <3, (13, 24, 29)>, <3, (28, 24, 29)>, <3, (13, 28, 29)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 19, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (9, 17, 19)>, <4, (9, 17, 10)>, <4, (9, 19, 10)>, <4, (17, 19, 10)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {20} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16, 24} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 21} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (9, 5, 21)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 4, 14, 27} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 8, 4)>, <9, (1, 8, 14)>, <9, (1, 8, 27)>, <9, (1, 4, 14)>, <9, (1, 4, 27)>, <9, (1, 14, 27)>, <9, (8, 4, 14)>, <9, (8, 4, 27)>, <9, (8, 14, 27)>, <9, (4, 14, 27)>
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {20, 1, 5, 24, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <10, (20, 1, 5)>, <10, (20, 1, 24)>, <10, (20, 1, 4)>, <10, (20, 5, 24)>, <10, (20, 5, 4)>, <10, (20, 24, 4)>, <10, (1, 5, 24)>, <10, (1, 5, 4)>, <10, (1, 24, 4)>, <10, (5, 24, 4)>
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {19, 27, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <11, (19, 27, 18)>
- And similarly for the remaining nodes...

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
