Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node  
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 11} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 13} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 6, 11} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 10, 13, 5} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 14, 17} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 10, 16, 3} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 13, 19} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 3} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {18, 11} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 9} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 17, 15} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {18, 1, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 16} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {4, 12} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 9, 13} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 3: 10  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 5: 10  
- From Node 6: 4  
- From Node 8: 1  
- From Node 11: 1  
- From Node 12: 4  
- From Node 13: 4  
- From Node 14: 4  
- From Node 16: 1  
- From Node 18: 4  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 48  
Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
