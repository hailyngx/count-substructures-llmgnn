Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 3, 6, 2} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
