Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 7, 14, 11, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 12, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 11, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 2, 5, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 3, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {12, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 7, 10, 14, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 12, 2, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 98

Therefore, there are a total of [98] 3-stars in the graph.
