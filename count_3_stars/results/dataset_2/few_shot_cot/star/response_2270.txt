Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 67

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in your graph.
