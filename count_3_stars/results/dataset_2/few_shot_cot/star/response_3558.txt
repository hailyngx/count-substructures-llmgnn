Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (5, 4, 3)>, <0, (5, 1, 3)>, <0, (4, 1, 2)>, <0, (4, 3, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 3)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (9, 7, 4)>, <1, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (7, 4, 3)>, <1, (7, 3, 1)>, <1, (4, 3, 2)>, <1, (4, 2, 1)>, <1, (3, 2, 1)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

    - 3-Stars: <5, (9, 1, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 2, 1, 7} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - 3-Stars: <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 4)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 4)>, <9, (5, 7, 1)>, <9, (5, 7, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 3)>, <9, (2, 1, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (7, 3, 1)>, <9, (7, 1, 2)>, <9, (7, 4, 3)>, <9, (3, 1, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 73
Therefore, there are a total of [73] 3-stars in your graph.
