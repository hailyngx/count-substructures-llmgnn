Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 6, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 5, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 0, 7, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 6, 9, 2, 5} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
