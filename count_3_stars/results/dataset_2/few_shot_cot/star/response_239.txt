Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 13, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 8, 16, 15} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {18, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 0, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 2, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 13, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 18} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {6, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(‎\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
