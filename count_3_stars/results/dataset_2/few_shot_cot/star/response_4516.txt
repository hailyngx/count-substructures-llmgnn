Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 6, 4, 2, 8} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 55
Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
