Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 2, 8, 4} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars

Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
