Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <0, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 9, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <1, (3, 2, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8, 6, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 5)>, <2, (3, 8, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 4)>, <2, (3, 4, 2)>, <2, (3, 2, 9)>, <2, (8, 4, 7)>, <2, (8, 2, 7)>, <2, (8, 2, 5)>, <2, (4, 6, 2)>, <2, (4, 6, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 3, 2)>, <2, (6, 4, 2)>, <2, (6, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 2, 8)>, <2, (9, 1, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 6, 9, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>, <3, (7, 2, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 5)>, <3, (6, 2, 4)>, <3, (6, 4, 2)>, <3, (6, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 9, 1)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 5, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - <4, (8, 5, 7)>, <4, (8, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (6, 5, 2)>, <4, (6, 5, 8)>, <4, (6, 2, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <6, (3, 4, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 2)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (3, 2, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <8, (4, 2, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <9, (1, 3, 2)>, <9, (1, 2, 0)>, <9, (1, 3, 0)>, <9, (3, 2, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
