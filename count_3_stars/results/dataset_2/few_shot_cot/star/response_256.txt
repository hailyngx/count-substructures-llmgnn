Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0)

Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 0, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 1, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 6, 9, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 2, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 9, 6, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 2, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
