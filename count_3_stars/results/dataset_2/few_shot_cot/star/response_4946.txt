Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 16, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {19, 18, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 14, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 10, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 0, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 16, 11, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
