Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
