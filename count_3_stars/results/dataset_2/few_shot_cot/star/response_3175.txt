Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 2} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 0, 19, 5} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 6} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 12} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 13, 6} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 13} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 4, 5, 10} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 7} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {15, 17, 10} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 12} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 19, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 18**: No neighbors
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 1} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 29
Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in the graph provided.
