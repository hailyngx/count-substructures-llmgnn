Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Star: <0, (7, 6, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Star: <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (5, 9, 2)>, <1, (5, 7, 2)>, <1, (9, 7, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Star: <2, (5, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 4, 1)>, <2, (5, 6, 1)>, <2, (4, 6, 1)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Star: <3, (9, 4, 8)>, <3, (9, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (9, 4, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Star: <4, (9, 2, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 8, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Star: <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (2, 8, 1)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Star: <6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 0)>, <6, (5, 2, 0)>, <6, (3, 2, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Star: <7, (9, 1, 8)>, <7, (9, 0, 8)>, <7, (9, 0, 1)>, <7, (1, 8, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Star: <8, (5, 7, 0)>, <8, (5, 7, 3)>, <8, (5, 0, 3)>, <8, (7, 0, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Star: <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 1, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
