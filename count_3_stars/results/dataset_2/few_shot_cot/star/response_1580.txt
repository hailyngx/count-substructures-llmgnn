Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
