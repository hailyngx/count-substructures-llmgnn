Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
