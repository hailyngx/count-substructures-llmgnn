Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 92

Therefore, there are a total of [92] 3-stars in your graph.
