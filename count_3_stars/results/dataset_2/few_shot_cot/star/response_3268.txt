Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <1, (9, 2, 4)>, <1, (9, 2, 7)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (9, 2, 5)>, <1, (9, 4, 5)>, <1, (9, 2, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 7, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 7, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <3, (5, 1, 7)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 7, 2)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 2)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (5, 1, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 2, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (9, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (4, 3, 2)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 3)>, <5, (4, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>, <5, (9, 3, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <7, (1, 3, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (9, 6, 2)>, <8, (4, 6, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 4, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 1, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 4, 6)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 1, 6)>, <9, (4, 1, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
