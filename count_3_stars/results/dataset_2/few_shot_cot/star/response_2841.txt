Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
