Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (12, 2, 3)>, <0, (12, 2, 13)>, <0, (12, 3, 13)>, <0, (2, 3, 13)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 12, 8, 13} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (11, 7, 12)>, <1, (11, 7, 8)>, <1, (11, 7, 13)>, <1, (11, 12, 8)>, <1, (11, 12, 13)>, <1, (11, 8, 13)>, <1, (7, 12, 8)>, <1, (7, 12, 13)>, <1, (7, 8, 13)>, <1, (12, 8, 13)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 13, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (5, 0, 13)>, <2, (5, 0, 3)>, <2, (5, 13, 3)>, <2, (0, 13, 3)>
- **Other Nodes**: 
    - Node 3, Node 5, Node 6, Node 9, Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14 each have 5 or more neighbors, so they can form 3-star configurations.
    - Node 4, Node 7, and Node 8 have less than 3 neighbors, so they cannot form 3-stars.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
  - Total from above calculations: 4 (Node 0) + 10 (Node 1) + 4 (Node 2) = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
