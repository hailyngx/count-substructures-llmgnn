Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
