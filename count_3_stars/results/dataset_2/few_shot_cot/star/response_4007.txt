Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 10, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 10, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 14, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 10, 14, 11, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 11, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 43
Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
