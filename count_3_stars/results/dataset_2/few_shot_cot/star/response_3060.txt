Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2)

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 5, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 5, 0, 1, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 0, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
