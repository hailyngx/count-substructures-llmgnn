Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 26} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 23, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {25, 24, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {21, 11, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
