Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node in the graph:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <0, (4, 1, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 0)>, <1, (3, 0, 5)>, <1, (6, 3, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (5, 7, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (5, 9, 1)>, <3, (5, 9, 2)>, <3, (5, 4, 1)>, <3, (5, 4, 2)>, <3, (9, 4, 1)>, <3, (9, 4, 2)>, <3, (4, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (4, 1, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 6, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (7, 8, 6)>, <4, (7, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 6, 3)>, <4, (8, 6, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <4, (7, 6, 0)>, <4, (8, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 3, 0)>, <4, (8, 3, 0)>, <4, (6, 3, 0)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (9, 4, 1)>, <6, (9, 4, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (4, 1, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (9, 4, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <8, (9, 4, 0)>, <8, (9, 6, 0)>, <8, (4, 6, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (8, 3, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
