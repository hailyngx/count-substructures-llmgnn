Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 28, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 28} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 4
