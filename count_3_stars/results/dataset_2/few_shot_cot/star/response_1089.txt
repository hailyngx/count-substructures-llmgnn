Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 18, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 19, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 11, 1} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
