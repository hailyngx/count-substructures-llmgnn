Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
