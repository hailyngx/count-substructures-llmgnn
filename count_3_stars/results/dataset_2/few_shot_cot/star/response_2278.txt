Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 17, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 11, 13, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 16, 13, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {17, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 8, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 19, 10, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 8, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} \) = 10
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {5, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} \) = 1
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 17, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} \) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
