Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node: 

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 17, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (16, 17, 19)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (4, 12, 14)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 2, 15, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <8, (16, 6, 15)>, <8, (16, 2, 15)>, <8, (16, 2, 12)>, <8, (6, 2, 15)>, <8, (6, 2, 12)>

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - <14, (11, 18, 1)>

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {8, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <16, (0, 8, 6)>

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 5
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in your graph.
