Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors. Remember that if a node has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 possible 3-star formed with that node.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {29, 18, 16, 28, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {24, 15, 20} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {29, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 20} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {22, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 29, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {21, 27, 25} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 21, 22} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {21, 10, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {20, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 17, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {27, 24, 28, 25, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {8, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {22, 28, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 11, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 23, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {21, 12, 25} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 20**: Neighbors = {9, 26, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 21**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 19, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 22**: Neighbors = {26, 7, 4, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 23**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 24**: Neighbors = {26, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 25**: Neighbors = {12, 6, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 26**: Neighbors = {22, 24, 20} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 27**: Neighbors = {12, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 28**: Neighbors = {12, 16, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
