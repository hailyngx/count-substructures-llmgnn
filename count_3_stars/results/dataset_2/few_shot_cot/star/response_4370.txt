Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 25} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 24, 27} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
