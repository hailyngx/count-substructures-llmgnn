Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 16, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 11} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
