Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 8, 1, 3} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 5, 1, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 8, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 0, 3, 5} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in your graph.
