Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 1, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
