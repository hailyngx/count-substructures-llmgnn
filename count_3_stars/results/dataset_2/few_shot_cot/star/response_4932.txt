Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 14)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 0, 6, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 14)>, <2, (0, 6, 14)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (2, 7, 12)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 1, 11} (5 neighbors)

  - Unique 3-star: <5, (1, 9, 11)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 10, 2, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (2, 7, 14)>

  - Unique 3-star: <10, (6, 13, 14)>
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 10, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <11, (9, 10, 12)>
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 11, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <12, (7, 11, 8)>
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
