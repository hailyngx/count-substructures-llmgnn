Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
