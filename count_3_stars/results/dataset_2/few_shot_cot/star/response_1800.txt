Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <0, (8, 6, 2)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <1, (9, 4, 2)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 0, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <2, (5, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 0)>, <2, (4, 1, 3)>, <2, (6, 0, 8)>, <2, (6, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 8, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 2)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 4)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 7, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (9, 4, 7)>, <3, (9, 7, 3)>, <3, (4, 7, 3)>, <3, (4, 3, 6)>, <3, (7, 3, 6)>, <3, (7, 6, 2)>, <3, (6, 2, 0)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 1, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 3)>, <4, (8, 9, 4)>, <4, (8, 4, 1)>, <4, (9, 3, 7)>, <4, (9, 7, 4)>, <4, (3, 7, 4)>, <4, (3, 4, 1)>, <4, (7, 4, 2)>, <4, (4, 2, 1)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <5, (9, 2, 3)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <6, (8, 3, 7)>, <6, (8, 7, 4)>, <6, (3, 7, 4)>, <6, (7, 4, 2)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-star: <7, (9, 4, 3)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (9, 0, 6)>, <8, (9, 6, 3)>, <8, (4, 0, 8)>, <8, (4, 8, 7)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (3, 7, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 1)>, <9, (7, 4, 1)>, <9, (4, 1, 2)>, <9, (4, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 5, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
