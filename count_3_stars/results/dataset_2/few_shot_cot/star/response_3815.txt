Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 8, 14, 2, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 4, 14, 0, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 7, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 11, 2, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
