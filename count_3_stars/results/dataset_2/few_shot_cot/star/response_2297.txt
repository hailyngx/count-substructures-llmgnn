Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 10, 13} (4 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 5, 13} (3 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 9} (3 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 13} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 12, 14, 2} (5 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 10, 2} (3 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 9, 8} (4 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 5, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 14, 2, 13} (6 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {12, 14} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 10, 14, 0, 11} (6 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 0, 9} (5 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 11, 9, 5} (5 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 4  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 5: 10  
- From Node 6: 1  
- From Node 7: 4  
- From Node 8: 10  
- From Node 9: 20  
- From Node 10: 4  
- From Node 12: 20  
- From Node 13: 10  
- From Node 14: 10  

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 95  
Therefore, there are a total of [95] 3-stars in the given graph.
