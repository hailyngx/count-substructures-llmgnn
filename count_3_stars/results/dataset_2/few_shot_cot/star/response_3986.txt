Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: No neighbors
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 13, 8} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 16, 11} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 17, 15} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 19} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16, 15, 5} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 15, 18} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 12} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 14} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 3} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {18, 3, 12, 10} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 8, 18, 9} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 17} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 13, 16} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 14, 15} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 18, 11} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
