Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 29} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 6) + 10 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 8) + 1 (from Node 9) + 4 (from Node 12) + 10 (from Node 13) + 1 (from Node 15) + 10 (from Node 16) + 4 (from Node 17) + 4 (from Node 18) + 10 (from Node 19) + 1 (from Node 21) + 1 (from Node 22) + 4 (from Node 23) + 4 (from Node 24) + 4 (from Node 27) + 4 (from Node 28) + 1 (from Node 29) = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
