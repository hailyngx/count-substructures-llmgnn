Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 7, 16, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 15, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {18, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in the graph provided.
