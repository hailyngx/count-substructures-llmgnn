Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors =  {9, 13, 7, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors =  {0, 11, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors =  {6, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors =  {6, 9, 0, 14, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors =  {5, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors =  {8, 4, 1, 3, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors =  {9, 3, 2, 8, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors =  {12, 0, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors =  {6, 9, 13, 5, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors =  {6, 8, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors =  {8, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors =  {13, 4, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors =  {13, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors =  {6, 8, 12, 11, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors =  {7, 12, 3, 5, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From nodes with 5 neighbors (Node 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 13, 14): 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 60
- From nodes with 4 neighbors (Node 7, 9): 4 + 4 = 8
- From nodes with 3 neighbors (Node 1, 4, 10, 11, 12): 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

Total number of 3-stars = 60 + 8 + 5 = 73

Therefore, there are a total of [73] 3-stars in your graph.
