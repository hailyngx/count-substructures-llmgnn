Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 11, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 0, 12, 1, 10} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 11, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 11, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 14, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 10, 14, 1} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 78

Therefore, there are a total of [78] 3-stars in your graph.
