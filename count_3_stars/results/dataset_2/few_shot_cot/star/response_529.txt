Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 14, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 18, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 19, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 16} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {18, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {15, 10, 18, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {6, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 16, 12, 17} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 16} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
