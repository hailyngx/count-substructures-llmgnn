Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 10
