Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 2, 3, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (17, 2, 3)>, <0, (17, 2, 18)>, <0, (17, 3, 18)>, <0, (2, 3, 18)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 5, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (11, 10, 5)>, <2, (11, 10, 0)>, <2, (11, 5, 0)>, <2, (10, 5, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 19, 0, 14, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (17, 19, 0)>, <3, (17, 19, 14)>, <3, (17, 19, 9)>, <3, (17, 0, 14)>, <3, (17, 0, 9)>, <3, (17, 14, 9)>, <3, (19, 0, 14)>, <3, (19, 0, 9)>, <3, (19, 14, 9)>, <3, (0, 14, 9)>

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
