Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {10, 4, 14, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: Neighbors = {5, 9, 10, 13, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: Neighbors = {8, 13, 4, 6, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: Neighbors = {9, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: Neighbors = {9, 8, 12, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: Neighbors = {5, 11, 14, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: Neighbors = {13, 12, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: Neighbors = {5, 4, 14, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 10: Neighbors = {0, 3, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 11: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 13: Neighbors = {10, 2, 1, 14, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 14: Neighbors = {9, 13, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 85

Therefore, there are a total of [85] 3-stars in your graph.
