- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 13, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 14, 16, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 15, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {12, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 9, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 9, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
