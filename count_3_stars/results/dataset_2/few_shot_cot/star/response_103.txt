Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 0, 6, 2, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
