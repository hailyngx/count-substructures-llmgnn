Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (0, 6, 9)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 1, 3, 5, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (4, 9, 1)>, <8, (4, 9, 3)>, <8, (4, 9, 5)>, <8, (4, 9, 0)>, <8, (4, 1, 3)>, <8, (4, 1, 5)>, <8, (4, 1, 0)>, <8, (4, 3, 5)>, <8, (4, 3, 0)>, <8, (4, 5, 0)>, <8, (9, 1, 3)>, <8, (9, 1, 5)>, <8, (9, 1, 0)>, <8, (9, 3, 5)>, <8, (9, 3, 0)>, <8, (9, 5, 0)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 0)>, <8, (1, 5, 0)>, <8, (3, 5, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
