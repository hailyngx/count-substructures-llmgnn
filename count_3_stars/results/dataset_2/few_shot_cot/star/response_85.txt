Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 0, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 17, 18, 13, 15} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 8, 7, 12, 14} (5 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
