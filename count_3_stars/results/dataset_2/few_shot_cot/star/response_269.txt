Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 67
