Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 14, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 5, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 11, 12, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 4, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 14, 11, 7, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 0, 11, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
