Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- Node 0: Neighbors = {6, 7, 3, 11, 10, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 1: Neighbors = {8, 5, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Neighbors = {9, 7, 10, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 3: Neighbors = {9, 12, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: Neighbors = {9, 5, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: Neighbors = {4, 8, 12, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Neighbors = {9, 7, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Neighbors = {6, 12, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: Neighbors = {5, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 9: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 14, 10, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 10: Neighbors = {9, 8, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 11: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: Neighbors = {7, 5, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 13: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 14: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 20 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 2) + 20 (from Node 9) = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
