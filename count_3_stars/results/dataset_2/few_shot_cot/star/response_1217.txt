Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 3

- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
