Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 3, 11, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12, 8, 9, 0, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 14, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 8, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 3, 12, 4, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12, 9, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 11, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 13: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 71

Therefore, there are a total of [71] 3-stars in your graph.
