Response:
Following the example provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 17, 11, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 15, 17, 14, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {19, 15, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 19, 17, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {15, 10, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 15, 1, 19, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 11, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
