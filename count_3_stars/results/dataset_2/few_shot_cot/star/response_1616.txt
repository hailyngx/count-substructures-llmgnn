Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
