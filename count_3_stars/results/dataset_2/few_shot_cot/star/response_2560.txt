Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 29
