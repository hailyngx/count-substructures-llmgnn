Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 12} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 15} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 18, 14} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 16} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 3, 1, 11} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 10} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 0} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 16, 3} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 16} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 14, 19} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 19} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 18} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 15} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 15, 19} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 3} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 11} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 2: 1
        - From Node 3: 1
        - From Node 4: 10
        - From Node 6: 1
        - From Node 7: 1
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 4
        - From Node 10: 1
        - From Node 11: 1
        - From Node 12: 1
        - From Node 13: 1
        - From Node 14: 4
        - From Node 15: 1
        - From Node 16: 1
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 29
        Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
