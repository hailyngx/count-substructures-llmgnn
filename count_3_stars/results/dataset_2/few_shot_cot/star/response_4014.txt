Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
