Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 2, 13, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 16, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 17, 0} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 15, 19} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 13, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
