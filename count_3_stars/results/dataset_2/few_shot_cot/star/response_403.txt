Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 8, 2, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 12, 5, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 10, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 6, 13, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 5, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 3, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 0, 6, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 14, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 6, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
