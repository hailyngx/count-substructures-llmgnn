Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph following the same procedure as shown in the example:

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 26} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {23, 11, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {24, 28, 25} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {20, 29} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 17, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 27} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {28, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
