Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 89

Therefore, there are a total of [89] 3-stars in your graph.
