Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 16, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 17} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 9, 5, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 19, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
