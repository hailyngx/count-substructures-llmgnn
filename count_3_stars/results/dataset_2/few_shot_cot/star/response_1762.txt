Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 14, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 2, 10, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 10, 13, 9, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 13, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 12, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 10, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 8, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 5, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 9, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
