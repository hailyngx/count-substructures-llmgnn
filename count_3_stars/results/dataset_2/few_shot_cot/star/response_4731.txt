Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (6, 9, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (9, 4, 3)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (9, 4, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <3, (7, 1, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (9, 7, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 3, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <7, (6, 9, 4)> <7, (6, 3, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 2, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <8, (6, 1, 2)> <8, (6, 2, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 1, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <9, (4, 2, 1)> <9, (4, 1, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 2
- From Node 8: 2
- From Node 9: 2

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
