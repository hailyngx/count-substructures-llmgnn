Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 18, 2, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
