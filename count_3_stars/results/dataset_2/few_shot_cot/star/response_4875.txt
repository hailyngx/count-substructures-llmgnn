Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 15, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 6, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 17} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
