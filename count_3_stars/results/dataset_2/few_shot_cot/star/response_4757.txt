Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 7, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 3, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 0, 5, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 1, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
