Response:
To calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll follow the same approach as in the example provided. We'll examine each node to determine how many 3-star configurations can be formed with it. Here's the step-by-step calculation:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 1, 6, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:

- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
