Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 22: 10
- From Node 23: 4
