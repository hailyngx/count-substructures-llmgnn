Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0:** Neighbors = {10, 15, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1:** Neighbors = {12, 4, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2:** Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3:** Neighbors = {2, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4:** Neighbors = {9, 1, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5:** Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6:** Neighbors = {17, 7, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7:** Neighbors = {17, 6, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8:** Neighbors = {6, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9:** Neighbors = {14, 4, 19, 0, 16} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10:** Neighbors = {14, 15, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11:** Neighbors = {15, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12:** Neighbors = {14, 15, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13:** Neighbors = {14, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14:** Neighbors = {12, 9, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15:** Neighbors = {12, 10, 0, 11, 16} (5 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19:** Neighbors = {17, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
