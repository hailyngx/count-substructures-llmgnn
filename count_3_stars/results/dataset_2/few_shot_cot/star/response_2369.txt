Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll now count the total number of 3-stars in this graph by following the same procedure as explained in the example:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {18, 5, 10, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
