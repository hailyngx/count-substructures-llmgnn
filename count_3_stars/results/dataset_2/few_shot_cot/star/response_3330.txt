Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars each node can form based on the criteria mentioned earlier.

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 29, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 28, 19, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 13, 23} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 25, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {26, 28} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 3) + 1 (from Node 4) + 1 (from Node 6) + 4 (from Node 8) + 4 (from Node 9) + 1 (from Node 10) + 10 (from Node 11) + 4 (from Node 12) + 1 (from Node 13) + 4 (from Node 14) + 4 (from Node 17) + 1 (from Node 18) + 1 (from Node 19) + 1 (from Node 22) + 4 (from Node 23) + 4 (from Node 25) + 1 (from Node 26) + 10 (from Node 28)

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in the given graph.
