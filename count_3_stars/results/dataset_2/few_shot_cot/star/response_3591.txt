Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From the nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8
- From nodes with 4 neighbors: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24
- From the node with 5 neighbors: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 8 + 24 + 10 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
