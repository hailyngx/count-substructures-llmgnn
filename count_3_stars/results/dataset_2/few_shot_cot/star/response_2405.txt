Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 20, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 10
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 27: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
