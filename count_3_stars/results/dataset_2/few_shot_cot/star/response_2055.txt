Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <1, (3, 6, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <2, (9, 1, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)>, <2, (9, 1, 7)>, <2, (9, 3, 8)>, <2, (9, 3, 7)>, <2, (9, 8, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 8, 7)>, <2, (3, 8, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 1, 4)>, <3, (9, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 3, 8)>, <4, (5, 3, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (9, 3, 8)>, <4, (9, 3, 0)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>, <4, (3, 8, 0)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (4, 0, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 7)>, <6, (5, 8, 7)>, <6, (1, 8, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <7, (5, 8, 6)>, <7, (5, 8, 2)>, <7, (5, 6, 2)>, <7, (8, 6, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <8, (4, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 2, 6)>, <8, (4, 7, 6)>, <8, (2, 7, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
