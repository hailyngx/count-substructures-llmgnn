Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in the given graph.
