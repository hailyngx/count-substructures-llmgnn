Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {23, 17, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 10
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
