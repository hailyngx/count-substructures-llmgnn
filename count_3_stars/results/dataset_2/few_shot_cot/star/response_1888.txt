Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 25: 1
