Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Star: <0, (7, 8, 1)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Star: <2, (6, 4, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <3, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (5, 4, 2)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 4, 2)>, <3, (6, 4, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <6, (9, 7, 3)>, <6, (9, 7, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (7, 3, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 0)>, <7, (5, 6, 4)>, <7, (5, 6, 0)>, <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (9, 6, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 0)>, <7, (6, 4, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Star: <8, (6, 0, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 5
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 5 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
