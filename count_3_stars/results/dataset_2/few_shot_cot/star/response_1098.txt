Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 19, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {18, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {14, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 16, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 19} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17, 13, 11, 18, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 16, 15} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 16} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 15, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 18, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {12, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 19, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {14, 8, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 1, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
