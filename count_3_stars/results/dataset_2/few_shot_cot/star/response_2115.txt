Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {19, 12, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 19, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 18, 12, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {16, 14, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 2, 13, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
