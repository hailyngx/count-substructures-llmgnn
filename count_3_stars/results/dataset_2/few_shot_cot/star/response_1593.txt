Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 14, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 11, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 11, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12, 14, 11, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 0, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 14, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 13, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 11, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
