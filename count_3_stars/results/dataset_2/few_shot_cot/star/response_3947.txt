Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {18, 4, 15, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 0, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 18, 4, 12, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {18, 1, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 15, 3, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {17, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 16, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {10, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
