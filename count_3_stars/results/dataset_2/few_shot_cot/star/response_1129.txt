Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 16, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
