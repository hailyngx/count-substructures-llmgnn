Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 5, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 5, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 9, 5, 0} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
