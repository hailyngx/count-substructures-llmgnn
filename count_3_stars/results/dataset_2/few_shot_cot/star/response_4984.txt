Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph by examining each node that has three or more neighbors:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 18, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 13, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 1, 13, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 4, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {16, 17, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 13, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 2, 10, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {18, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 14, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Now, sum up the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
