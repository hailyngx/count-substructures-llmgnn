Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 14, 1, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 10, 2, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 13, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 11, 13, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 13, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 10, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in your graph.
