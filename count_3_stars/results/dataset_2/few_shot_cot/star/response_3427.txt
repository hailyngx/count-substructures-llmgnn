Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1)

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 0, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 4, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 9, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 4, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
