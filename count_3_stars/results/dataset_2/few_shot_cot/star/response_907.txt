Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 16, 4, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (6, 4, 19)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 18, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 9, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
