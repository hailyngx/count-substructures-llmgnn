Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 13} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5, 18} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 5} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 13} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 2, 19, 12} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 16} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 14, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 12} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 0} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 17} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 16} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {13, 18, 6} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {11, 19, 2, 18} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 19, 16} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 17, 5, 18} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
