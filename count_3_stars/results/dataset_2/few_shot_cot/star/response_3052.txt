Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0)

Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 0, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
