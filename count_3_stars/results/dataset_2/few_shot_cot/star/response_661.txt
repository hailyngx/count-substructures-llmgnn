Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 9, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 15, 0} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 9, 4} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 12} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 18, 13} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {17, 8} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 19} (3 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 15, 0, 19} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16, 17, 3, 19} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 15} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 15} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {0, 10} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 4
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 2: 4
        - From Node 6: 4
        - From Node 9: 10
        - From Node 10: 4
        - From Node 11: 1
        - From Node 12: 1
        - From Node 15: 4
        - From Node 17: 4
        - From Node 19: 1
        Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 38
        Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
