Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
