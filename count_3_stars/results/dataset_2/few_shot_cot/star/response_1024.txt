Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4, 7, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 7, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 54
Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
