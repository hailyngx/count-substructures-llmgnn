Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 9, 12, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 1, 2, 0, 5} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 14, 7, 4, 10} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 10, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 9, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 4, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {12, 7, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 5, 10, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 9, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
