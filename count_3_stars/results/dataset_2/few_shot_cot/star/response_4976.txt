Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
