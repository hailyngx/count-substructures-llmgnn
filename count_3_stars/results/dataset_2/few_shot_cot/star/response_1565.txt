Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 2
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 2
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
