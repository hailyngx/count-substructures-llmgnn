Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9} (2 neighbors)
    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {19, 13, 12} (3 neighbors)
    Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    <1, (19, 13, 12)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 16} (2 neighbors)
    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 5, 14, 17} (5 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
