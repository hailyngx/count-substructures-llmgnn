Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 11, 0, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <1, (6, 9, 11)>, <1, (6, 9, 5)>, <1, (9, 11, 5)>, <1, (6, 11, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 12, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 13, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 10, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (9, 7, 13)>, <6, (9, 1, 13)>, <6, (1, 7, 13)>, <6, (1, 7, 10)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 12, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <7, (11, 12, 0)>, <7, (6, 11, 0)>, <7, (6, 12, 0)>, <7, (6, 11, 13)>, <7, (11, 0, 13)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2, 5, 0, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <8, (9, 10, 2)>, <8, (9, 10, 5)>, <8, (9, 2, 5)>, <8, (10, 2, 5)>, <8, (9, 10, 0)>, <8, (9, 2, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 8, 2, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <10, (6, 11, 14)>, <10, (6, 8, 14)>, <10, (6, 2, 14)>, <10, (11, 8, 14)>, <10, (11, 2, 14)>
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 1, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
