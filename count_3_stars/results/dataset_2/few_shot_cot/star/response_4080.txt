Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node in the Provided Graph:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 11, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 6, 13, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 12, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 1, 6, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {12, 4, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 12, 4, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 10, 11, 6, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
