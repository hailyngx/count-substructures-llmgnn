Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3

Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 3, 2, 8} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 1, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 63
Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
