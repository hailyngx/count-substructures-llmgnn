Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {23, 15, 29, 24} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {21, 26, 14, 28} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
