Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 0, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
