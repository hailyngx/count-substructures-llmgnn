Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0:** Neighbors = {7, 3, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1:** Neighbors = {7, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2:** Neighbors = {6, 0, 14, 13, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3:** Neighbors = {5, 6, 0, 13, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4:** Neighbors = {9, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5:** Neighbors = {6, 13, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6:** Neighbors = {5, 3, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7:** Neighbors = {4, 0, 10, 13, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8:** Neighbors = {5, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9:** Neighbors = {4, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10:** Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11:** Neighbors = {8, 14, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12:** Neighbors = {4, 8, 0, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13:** Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 14, 2, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 14:** Neighbors = {9, 11, 12, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 20
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 79

Therefore, there are a total of [79] 3-stars in your graph.
