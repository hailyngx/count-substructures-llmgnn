Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 47

Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
