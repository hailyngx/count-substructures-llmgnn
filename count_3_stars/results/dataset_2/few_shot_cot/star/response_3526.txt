Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
