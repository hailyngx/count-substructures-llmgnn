Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 4, 8, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 8, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Not connected to any other nodes. (0 neighbors)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 2, 4, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 2, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 78

Therefore, there are a total of [78] 3-stars in your graph.
