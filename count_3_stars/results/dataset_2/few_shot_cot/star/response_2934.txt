Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (9, 1, 6)>, <0, (9, 1, 2)>, <0, (1, 6, 2)>, <0, (9, 6, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 6, 0, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <1, (5, 7, 3)>, <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <1, (5, 7, 0)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 3, 6)>, <1, (5, 3, 0)>, <1, (5, 3, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 0)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 8)>, <1, (7, 3, 6)>, <1, (7, 3, 0)>, <1, (7, 3, 8)>, <1, (7, 6, 0)>, <1, (7, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 0, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 0)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 0, 8)>, <1, (6, 0, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (7, 3, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (9, 4, 1)>, <3, (9, 4, 8)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 1, 8)>, <3, (9, 2, 8)>, <3, (4, 1, 2)>, <3, (4, 1, 8)>, <3, (4, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (7, 1, 8)>, <6, (7, 1, 0)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (4, 6, 1)>, <7, (4, 2, 1)>, <7, (6, 2, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (9, 4, 3)>, <8, (9, 1, 3)>, <8, (9, 1, 6)>, <8, (9, 3, 6)>, <8, (4, 1, 3)>, <8, (4, 1, 6)>, <8, (4, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <9, (8, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 0)>, <9, (4, 3, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
