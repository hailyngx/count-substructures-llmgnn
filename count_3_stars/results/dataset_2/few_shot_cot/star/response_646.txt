Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 11, 6, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 18, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 10, 2, 13, 17} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {12, 1, 17, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 4, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 16**: Isolated node with no neighbors.
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {6, 15, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
