Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 2, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 6, 9, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
