Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 11, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (3, 13, 11)>, <0, (3, 13, 2)>, <0, (3, 11, 2)>, <0, (13, 11, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 configurations from node 0 + 4 from node 2 + 4 from node 3 + 4 from node 7 + 4 from node 8 + 4 from node 13 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
