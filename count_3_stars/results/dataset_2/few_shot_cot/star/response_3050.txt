Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 14, 11, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 10, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 8, 13, 11} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 10, 2, 12} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 14, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
