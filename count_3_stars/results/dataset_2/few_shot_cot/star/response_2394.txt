Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 14, 19} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 4, 18, 16} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 5} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 18, 11} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 1} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 15} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 12, 3, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 15, 0} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 12, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14, 4, 5, 16} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 13} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 16} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {18, 13, 19, 1, 15} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {14, 16, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {0, 16} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
