Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 16, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (3, 8, 16)>, <0, (3, 8, 12)>, <0, (3, 16, 12)>, <0, (8, 16, 12)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4

- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
