Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node 
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 3, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 0, 3, 6} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars 
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
