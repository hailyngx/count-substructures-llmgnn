Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 4, 1, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 0, 7, 12, 14} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 7, 12, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 3, 7, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 9, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {12, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 12, 6, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
