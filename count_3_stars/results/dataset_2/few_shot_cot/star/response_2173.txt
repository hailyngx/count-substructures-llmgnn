Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 7, 2)>, <1, (6, 7, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <2, (6, 8, 1)>, <2, (6, 8, 3)>, <2, (6, 1, 3)>, <2, (8, 1, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 4, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (5, 9, 2)>, <3, (5, 9, 0)>, <3, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (5, 6, 0)>, <3, (5, 4, 2)>, <3, (5, 4, 0)>, <3, (5, 2, 0)>, <3, (9, 6, 4)>, <3, (9, 6, 2)>, <3, (9, 6, 0)>, <3, (9, 4, 2)>, <3, (9, 4, 0)>, <3, (9...
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <4, (7, 8, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 3, 2, 8} (6 neighbors)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 4, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 1)>, <7, (5, 6, 4)>, <7, (5, 6, 1)>, <7, (5, 4, 1)>, <7, (9, 6, 4)>, <7, (9, 6, 1)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <7, (6, 4, 1)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
