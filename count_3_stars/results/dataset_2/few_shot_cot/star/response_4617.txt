  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 18, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 5} (3 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 16, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 19} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
