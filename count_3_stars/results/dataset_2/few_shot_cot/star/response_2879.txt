Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 5, 7, 12, 3} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 13, 9, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 0, 9, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 14, 4, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 4, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 13, 4, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 0, 1, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 87

Therefore, there are a total of [87] 3-stars in your graph.
