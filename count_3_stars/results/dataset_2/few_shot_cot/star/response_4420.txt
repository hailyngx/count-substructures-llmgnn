Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 4, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 2, 5, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
