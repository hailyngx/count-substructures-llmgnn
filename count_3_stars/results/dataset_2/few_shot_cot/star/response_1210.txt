Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 26, 20, 25, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
