Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 6, 14, 13, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 4, 0, 3, 10} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 8, 1, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2, 8, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 11, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 6, 7, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 103

Therefore, there are a total of [103] 3-stars in your graph.
