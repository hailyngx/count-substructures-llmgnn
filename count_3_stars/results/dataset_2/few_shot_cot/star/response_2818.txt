Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
From Node 0: 1
From Node 1: 4
From Node 3: 10
From Node 4: 4
From Node 9: 4
From Node 10: 4
From Node 11: 10
From Node 12: 4
From Node 14: 4
From Node 17: 4
From Node 19: 1
From Node 20: 4
From Node 21: 10
From Node 25: 10
From Node 26: 1
From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 75
