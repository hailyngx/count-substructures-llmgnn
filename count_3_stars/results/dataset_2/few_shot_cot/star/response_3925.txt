Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 29, 15, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {28, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
