Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 14, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
