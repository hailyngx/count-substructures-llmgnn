Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 25} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {26, 28, 13} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 11: 1
