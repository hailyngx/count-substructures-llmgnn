Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 25: 1
