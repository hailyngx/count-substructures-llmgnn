Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 3, 1, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 1, 3, 14, 4} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 6, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 1, 11} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 4, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 11, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {12, 13, 0, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {12, 8, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 11, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 3, 9, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {2, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
