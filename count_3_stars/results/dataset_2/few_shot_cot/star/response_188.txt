Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0:** Neighbors = {6, 4, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1:** Neighbors = {16, 17, 10, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2:** Neighbors = {8, 12, 19, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3:** Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9:** Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10:** Neighbors = {18, 1, 14, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11:** Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12:** Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13:** Neighbors = {11, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14:** Neighbors = {6, 19, 10} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in the graph.
