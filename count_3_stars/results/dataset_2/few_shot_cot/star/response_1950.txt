Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 3, 2, 8} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 4, 0, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in your graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 2)>
<5, (2, 0, 3)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<7, (6, 1, 2)>
