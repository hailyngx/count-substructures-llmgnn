Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 2, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (5, 9, 8)>, <0, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (5, 2, 8)>, <0, (5, 2, 4)>, <0, (5, 8, 4)>, <0, (9, 2, 8)>, <0, (9, 2, 4)>, <0, (9, 8, 4)>, <0, (2, 8, 4)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (5, 3, 4)>, <1, (5, 3, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (9, 8, 4)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>, <2, (8, 4, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (9, 1, 8)>, <3, (9, 1, 4)>, <3, (9, 8, 4)>, <3, (1, 8, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 0)>, <4, (1, 2, 0)>, <4, (3, 2, 0)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 0, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (5, 6, 1)>, <7, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (6, 1, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <8, (9, 3, 0)>, <8, (9, 3, 7)>, <8, (9, 2, 0)>, <8, (9, 2, 7)>, <8, (9, 0, 7)>, <8, (3, 2, 0)>, <8, (3, 2, 7)>, <8, (3, 0, 7)>, <8, (2, 0, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - Possible 3-stars: <9, (8, 2, 3)>, <9, (8, 2, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 0)>, <9, (2, 3, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
