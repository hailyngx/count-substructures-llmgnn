Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 18, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {16, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {18, 0, 11, 15, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 16, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {16, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 17, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 12, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {19, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
