Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 15, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {18, 13, 15, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 11} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {16, 0, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
