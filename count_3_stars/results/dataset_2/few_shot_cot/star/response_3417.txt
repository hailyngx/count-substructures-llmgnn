Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10 (configurations listed above)
- From Node 1: 10 (configurations listed above)
- From Node 2: 10 (configurations listed above)
- From Node 3: 10 (configurations listed above)
- From Node 5: 4 (configurations listed above)
- From Node 6: 4 (configurations listed above)
- From Node 8: 10 (configurations listed above)
- From Node 9: 4 (configurations listed above)
- From Node 10: 10 (configurations listed above)
- From Node 13: 4 (configurations listed above)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
