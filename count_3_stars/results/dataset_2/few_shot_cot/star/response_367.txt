Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node: 

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 11, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 7, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 0, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 3, 0, 14, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 11, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {12, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 14, 7, 1, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 12, 14, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 13, 11, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 92

Therefore, there are a total of [92] 3-stars in the given graph.
