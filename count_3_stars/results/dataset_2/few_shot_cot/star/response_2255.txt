Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 1)>, <0, (9, 7, 1)>, <0, (5, 9, 1)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 2, 8, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (6, 4, 7)>, <1, (6, 4, 2)>, <1, (6, 4, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 2)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 2, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>, <1, (7, 2, 8)>, and their reversals.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (9, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 1, 3)>, <4, (7, 1, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (8, 0, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 0, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (5, 6, 4)>, <7, (5, 6, 0)>, <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 1)>, <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (5, 4, 3)>, <7, (5, 4, 1)>, <7, (5, 0, 3)>, <7, (5, 0, 1)>, <7, (5, 3, 1)>, <7, (6, 4, 0)>, <7, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (6, 4, 1)>, <7, (6, 0, 3)>, <7, (6, 0, 1)>, <7, (6, 3, 1)>, <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <7, (4, 0, 1)>, <7, (4, 3, 1)>, <7, (0, 3, 1)>, and their reversals.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (5, 6, 3)>, <8, (5, 6, 1)>, <8, (5, 3, 1)>, <8, (6, 3, 1)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 4, 0)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (4, 2, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
