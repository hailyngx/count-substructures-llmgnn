Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {18, 4, 7, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 14, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 0, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 10, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 13, 19, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 15, 3, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {18, 19, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {19, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 9, 11} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 15, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {1, 15, 11, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
