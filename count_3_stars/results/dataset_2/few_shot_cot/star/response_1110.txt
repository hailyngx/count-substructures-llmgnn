Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <0, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 
  - <1, (3, 8, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <2, (6, 8, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 0, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <4, (1, 2, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <6, (5, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <7, (1, 3, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 2, 9, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 0)>, <8, (5, 6, 2)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 2, 9)>, <8, (5, 2, 0)>, <8, (5, 9, 0)>, <8, (6, 2, 9)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>, <8, (6, 9, 0)>, <8, (2, 9, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 4, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <9, (3, 8, 4)>, <9, (3, 8, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 11
- From Node 9: 7

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 11 + 7 = 24

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in your graph.
