Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
