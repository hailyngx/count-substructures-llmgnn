Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 10
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 4
