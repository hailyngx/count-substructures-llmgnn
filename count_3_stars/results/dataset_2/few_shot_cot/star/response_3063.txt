Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {27, 25, 22, 4} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 28: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in your graph.
