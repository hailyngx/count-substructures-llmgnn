Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4
