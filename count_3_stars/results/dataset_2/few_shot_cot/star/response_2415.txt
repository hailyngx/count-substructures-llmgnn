Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 4, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 0, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 2, 12, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
