Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
From Node 1: 1
From Node 4: 1
From Node 5: 4
From Node 6: 4
From Node 8: 4
From Node 9: 1
From Node 10: 1
From Node 11: 1
From Node 12: 4
From Node 14: 1
From Node 15: 10
From Node 16: 4
From Node 18: 1
From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 35
