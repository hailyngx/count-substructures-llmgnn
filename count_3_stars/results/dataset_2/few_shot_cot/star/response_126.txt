Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 5
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 10
- From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 5 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
