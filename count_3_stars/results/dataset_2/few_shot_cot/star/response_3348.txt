Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <0, (7, 3, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (5, 4, 3)>, <1, (5, 4, 2)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (4, 3, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <2, (5, 6, 1)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 0)>, <2, (5, 1, 8)>, <2, (5, 1, 0)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (6, 1, 8)>, <2, (6, 1, 0)>, <2, (6, 8, 0)>, <2, (1, 8, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <3, (9, 6, 1)>, <3, (9, 6, 0)>, <3, (9, 6, 8)>, <3, (9, 1, 0)>, <3, (9, 1, 8)>, <3, (9, 0, 8)>, <3, (6, 1, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 0, 8)>, <3, (1, 0, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 1, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (2, 1, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 2)>, <6, (5, 9, 8)>, <6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 3, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (3, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 6, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <8, (9, 7, 6)>, <8, (9, 7, 3)>, <8, (9, 7, 2)>, <8, (9, 6, 3)>, <8, (9, 6, 2)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <8, (7, 6, 3)>, <8, (7, 6, 2)>, <8, (7, 3, 2)>, <8, (6, 3, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in your graph.
