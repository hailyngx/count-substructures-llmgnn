Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12, 15} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 19} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 15, 16, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 18, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 15, 5, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 11, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 2, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {6, 16, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
