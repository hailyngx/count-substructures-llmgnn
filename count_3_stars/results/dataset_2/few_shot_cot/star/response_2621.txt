Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <0, (3, 8, 2)>, <0, (3, 2, 7)>, <0, (8, 2, 7)>, <0, (3, 8, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <1, (9, 3, 5)>, <1, (9, 3, 7)>, <1, (9, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 5, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <2, (9, 8, 5)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (9, 8, 7)>, <2, (9, 5, 0)>, <2, (9, 5, 7)>, <2, (8, 5, 0)>, <2, (8, 5, 7)>, <2, (9, 0, 7)>, <2, (8, 0, 7)>, <2, (5, 0, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 0, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <3, (9, 1, 7)>, <3, (9, 1, 5)>, <3, (9, 7, 0)>, <3, (9, 7, 5)>, <3, (1, 7, 0)>, <3, (1, 7, 5)>, <3, (9, 0, 5)>, <3, (1, 0, 5)>, <3, (7, 0, 5)>, <3, (9, 1, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 8, 2, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-stars: <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 1, 8)>, <5, (6, 1, 2)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, 
  <5, (6, 3, 8)>, <5, (6, 3, 2)>, <5, (6, 3, 7)>, <5, (6, 8, 2)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, 
  <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 2)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 8, 2)>,
  <5, (1, 8, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (3, 8, 2)>, <5, (3, 8, 7)>, <5, (3, 2, 7)>, 
  <5, (8, 2, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 2)>, <7, (1, 3, 0)>, <7, (1, 5, 2)>, <7, (1, 5, 0)>, <7, (3, 5, 2)>, <7, (3, 5, 0)>, <7, (3, 2, 0)>, <7, (5, 2, 0)>, <7, (1, 2, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 5, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <8, (4, 5, 0)>, <8, (2, 5, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <9, (4, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (2, 3, 1)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
