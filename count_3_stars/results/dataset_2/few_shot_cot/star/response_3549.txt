Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid 3-star configurations:
- From Nodes 0, 7, 19, 12, 16: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50
- From Nodes 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 32

Total number of 3-stars = 50 + 32 = 82

Therefore, there are [82] 3-stars in your graph.
