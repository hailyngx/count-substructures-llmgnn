Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
