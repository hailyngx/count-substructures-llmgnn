Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 12, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 18, 14, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 19, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {16, 4, 17, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {13, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 13, 19, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {14, 17, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
