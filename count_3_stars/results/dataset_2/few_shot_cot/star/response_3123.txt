Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 7, 17} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 18, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 15, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 0, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
