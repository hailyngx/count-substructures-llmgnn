Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (6, 13, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 10, 16} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
