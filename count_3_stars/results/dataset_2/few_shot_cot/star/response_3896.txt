Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 15, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 12, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 15, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 16, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 18, 14, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 19, 11} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in the provided graph.
