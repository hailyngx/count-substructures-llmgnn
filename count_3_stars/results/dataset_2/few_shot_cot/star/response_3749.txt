Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
