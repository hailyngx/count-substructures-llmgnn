Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 16, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 12, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {19, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 16, 12, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 9, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 16, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 15, 12} (4 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
