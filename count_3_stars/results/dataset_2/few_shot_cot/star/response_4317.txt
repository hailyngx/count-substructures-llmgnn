Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 14, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 13, 17, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {18, 13, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 10, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {18, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 17, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 19, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 8} (2 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in the graph provided.
