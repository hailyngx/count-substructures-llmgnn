Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 24: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
