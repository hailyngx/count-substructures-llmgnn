Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
