Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 14, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 9, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {15, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 16, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 19} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 1, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {16, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 13, 18, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in the provided graph.
