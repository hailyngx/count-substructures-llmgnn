Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 2, 4, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
