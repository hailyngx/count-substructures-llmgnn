Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {27, 7, 21, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 27, 23, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 22, 3, 17, 16} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 28, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {22, 26, 23, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29** do not have enough neighbors to form 3-stars.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 27, 17, 18, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 5, 25} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {28, 24, 14, 25} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
