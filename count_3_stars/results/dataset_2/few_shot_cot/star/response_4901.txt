Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
