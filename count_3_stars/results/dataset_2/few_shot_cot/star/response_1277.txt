Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 23} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {20, 27} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
