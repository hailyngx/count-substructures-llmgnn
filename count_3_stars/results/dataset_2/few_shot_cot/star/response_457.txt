Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {28, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbor = {28} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 12, 5, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 12, 29} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 10
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 73

Therefore, there are a total of [73] 3-stars in your graph.
