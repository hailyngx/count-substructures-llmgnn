Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
  <0, (5, 9, 1)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
  <1, (4, 7, 3)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <1, (4, 3, 2)>, <1, (7, 3, 2)>, <1, (4, 7, 0)>, <1, (4, 3, 0)>, <1, (7, 3, 0)>, <1, (4, 2, 0)>, <1, (7, 2, 0)>, <1, (3, 2, 0)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
  <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)>, <2, (4, 1, 8)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
  <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 7, 1)>, <3, (6, 7, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 1)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
  <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (9, 8, 1)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (8, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4} {3} = 4\)  
  <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (0, 3, 7)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
  <7, (5, 6, 4)>, <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 1)>, <7, (5, 4, 3)>, <7, (5, 4, 1)>, <7, (5, 3, 1)>, <7, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (6, 4, 1)>, <7, (6, 3, 1)>, <7, (4, 3, 1)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
  <8, (9, 4, 2)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
  <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 2, 0)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 2, 0)>, <9, (4, 2, 0)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
1 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 2) + 4 (from Node 3) + 10 (from Node 4) + 4 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 8) + 10 (from Node 9) = 44  

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
