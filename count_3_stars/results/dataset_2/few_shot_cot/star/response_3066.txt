Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list provided, we'll determine the number of 3-star configurations around each node that has at least three neighbors:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 16, 9} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 2} (3 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {19, 1} (2 neighbors)  
            - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
            - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 14} (2 neighbors)  
            - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
            - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16, 11, 14} (3 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {12, 18, 19} (3 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 11, 17} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 13, 17} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 18, 11} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 17} (3 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
            - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 9} (3 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {19, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
            - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 4
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 3: 4
        - From Node 7: 1
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 4
        - From Node 10: 1
        - From Node 11: 4
        - From Node 12: 1
        - From Node 13: 4
        - From Node 14: 4
        - From Node 15: 1
        - From Node 17: 1
        - From Node 18: 1
        - From Node 19: 4
        Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 35
        Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
