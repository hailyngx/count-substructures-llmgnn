Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
