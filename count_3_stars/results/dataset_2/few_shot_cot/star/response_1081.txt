Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 10
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 60
