Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 0

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 0, 3, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 1, 4} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
