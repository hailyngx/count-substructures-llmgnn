Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 11, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (1 unique 3-star)
  - <1, (5, 3, 11)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 13, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - <4, (7, 0, 10)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 1, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 14, 7, 11, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - <7, (6, 4, 10)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 8, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (1 unique 3-star)
  - <14, (9, 6, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
