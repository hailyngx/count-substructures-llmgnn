Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 14, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 1, 10, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 14, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 3, 11, 1, 10} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 11, 0, 14, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 7, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 3, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 7, 9, 1, 6} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 97

Therefore, there are a total of [97] 3-stars in your graph.
