Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {18, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 17, 12, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {18, 19, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 18, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 5, 15} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
