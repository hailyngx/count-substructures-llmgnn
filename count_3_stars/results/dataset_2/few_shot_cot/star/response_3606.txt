Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 7, 10, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {14, 11, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 12, 8, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 10, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 14, 7, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 10: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
