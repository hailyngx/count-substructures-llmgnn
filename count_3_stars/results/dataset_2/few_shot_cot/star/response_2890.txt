Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
