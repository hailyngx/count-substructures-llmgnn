Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided for the graph, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 22, 11, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 20, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {21, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 26, 6, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 23} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 27: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
