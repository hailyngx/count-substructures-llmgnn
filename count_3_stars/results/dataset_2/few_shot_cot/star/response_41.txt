Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (6, 2, 3)>, <1, (6, 2, 7)>, <1, (6, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 1, 4)>, <2, (5, 1, 0)>, <2, (5, 3, 4)>, <2, (5, 3, 0)>, <2, (5, 4, 0)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 0)>, <2, (1, 4, 0)>, <2, (3, 4, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 0, 2, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (9, 1, 7)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 1, 8)>, <3, (9, 7, 2)>, <3, (9, 7, 8)>, <3, (9, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 2)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (7, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 0)>, <3, (1, 2, 0)>, <3, (1, 8, 0)>, <3, (7, 2, 0)>, <3, (7, 8, 0)>, <3, (2, 8, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (5, 6, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 4, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (5, 9, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 4)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <6, (5, 4, 8)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (4, 8, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)

  - Unique 3-star: <7, (5, 1, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 9, 3)>, <8, (5, 6, 3)>, <8, (9, 6, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
