Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 0, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 5, 6, 2, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({6 \choose 3} = 20\) 
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in the graph provided.
