Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 0, 17} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
