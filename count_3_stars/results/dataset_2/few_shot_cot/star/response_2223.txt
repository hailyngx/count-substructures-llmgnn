Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node 
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <2, (8, 4, 6)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 6, 14, 12, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 5, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <4, (8, 9, 5)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <5, (11, 4, 6)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <6, (5, 3, 2)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 2, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <8, (13, 4, 2)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 14, 7, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <9, (13, 4, 7)>

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 12, 7, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 7, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <12, (10, 8, 3)>

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 81

Therefore, there are a total of [81] 3-stars in your graph based on the provided adjacency list.
