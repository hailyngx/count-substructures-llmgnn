Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors. Remember, a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, there's only 1 3-star formed with that node. 

Let's calculate the 3-star configurations for each node based on the provided adjacency list:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 3, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (9, 3, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (9, 1, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (9, 6, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (5, 8, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (4, 0, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 2, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (4, 1, 3)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (5, 2, 3)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
