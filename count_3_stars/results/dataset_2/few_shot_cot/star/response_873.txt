Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 14, 13, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 6, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 11, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 11, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 2, 10, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Does not form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 10, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
