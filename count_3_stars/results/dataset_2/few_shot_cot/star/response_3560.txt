Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 11, 13, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 2, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 1, 3, 14, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors. 

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors. 

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 3, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 0, 13, 8, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 13, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 12, 14, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in the given graph.
