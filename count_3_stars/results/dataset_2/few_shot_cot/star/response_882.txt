Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
