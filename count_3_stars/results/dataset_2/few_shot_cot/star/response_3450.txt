Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 1, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 19, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 6, 14} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
