Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 6, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 1, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {16, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 12, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 17, 19} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 1, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 7, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 6, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
