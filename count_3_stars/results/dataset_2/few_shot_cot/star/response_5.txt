Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (4, 6, 2)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 2, 9)>, <0, (6, 2, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (7, 6, 5)>, <1, (7, 6, 9)>, <1, (7, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 5, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 0)>, <2, (4, 9, 0)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (7, 6, 8)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - 3-Stars: <7, (4, 3, 1)>, <7, (4, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 1, 8)>, <7, (3, 1, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (4, 7, 3)>, <8, (4, 7, 5)>, <8, (4, 3, 5)>, <8, (7, 3, 5)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
