Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
