Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 93

Therefore, there are a total of [93] 3-stars in your graph.
