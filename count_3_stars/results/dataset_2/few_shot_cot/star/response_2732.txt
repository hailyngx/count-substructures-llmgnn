Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 12, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 14, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 6, 13, 12, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 11, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 9, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 12, 5, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - No 3-star can be formed as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in your graph.
