Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 14, 3, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 14, 5, 1, 13} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 0, 14, 13, 5} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 12, 0, 10, 6} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 12, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 11, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 3, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 106

Therefore, there are a total of [106] 3-stars in your graph.
