Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
