Node 5 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 5, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 7, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
