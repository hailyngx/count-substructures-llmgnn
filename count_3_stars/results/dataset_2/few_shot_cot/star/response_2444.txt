Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 15, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 25} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1
