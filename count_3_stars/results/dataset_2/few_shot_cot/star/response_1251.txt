Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 2, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 6, 9, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
