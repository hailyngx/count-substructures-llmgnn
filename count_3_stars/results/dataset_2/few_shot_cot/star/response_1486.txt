Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 15} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 16, 19} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {18, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 17, 18, 16} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 19, 6, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 15} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 19, 18, 15} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 1, 19} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 12, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 18, 0, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 15, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
