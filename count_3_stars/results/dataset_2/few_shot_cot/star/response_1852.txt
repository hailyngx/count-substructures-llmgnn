Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 10, 17} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 10
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 29: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
