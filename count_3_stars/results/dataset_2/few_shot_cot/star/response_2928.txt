Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8, 6, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <2, (5, 4, 8)>, <2, (5, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 8, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (8, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 8, 7)>, <2, (6, 8, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 6, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-star: <3, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (5, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 8, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 7)>, <3, (6, 8, 7)>, <3, (5, 4, 0)>, <3, (5, 6, 0)>, <3, (5, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 6, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <4, (8, 3, 6)>, <4, (8, 3, 7)>, <4, (8, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)

  - 3-star: <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (9, 7, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 7, 3)>, <5, (1, 7, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <6, (8, 4, 3)>, <6, (8, 4, 7)>, <6, (8, 3, 7)>, <6, (4, 3, 7)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <7, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 3, 0)>, <7, (8, 3, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <8, (4, 2, 6)>, <8, (4, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <9, (5, 3, 1)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
