Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 0, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 1, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 5, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 13, 10, 14, 11} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 0, 3, 8, 12} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 11, 13, 3, 2} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 11, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 93

Therefore, there are a total of [93] 3-stars in your graph.
