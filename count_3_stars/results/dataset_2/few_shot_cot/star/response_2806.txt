Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
