Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 16, 19, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 14, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {19, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 11} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 17, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 16, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 12, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
