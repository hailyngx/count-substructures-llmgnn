Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 6, 13, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 12, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 13, 2, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 10, 11, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 5, 6, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 2, 14, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
