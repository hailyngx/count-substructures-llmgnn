Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 9, 2} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 6, 9, 5, 12} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 11, 6, 2, 5} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 11, 13, 5} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 5, 2, 9} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: No neighbors
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 98

Therefore, there are a total of [98] 3-stars in your graph.
