Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 11} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 8} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 5, 2} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 7, 11, 12} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 14, 10, 5} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 11, 7} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 10, 1, 13} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 0, 2, 5} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {14, 5, 10} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 4, 10} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
