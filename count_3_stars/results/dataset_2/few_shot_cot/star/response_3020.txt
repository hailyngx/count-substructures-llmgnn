Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (6, 4, 7)>, <0, (6, 4, 1)>, <0, (6, 7, 1)>, <0, (4, 7, 1)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (6, 2, 8)>, <1, (6, 2, 0)>, <1, (6, 8, 0)>, <1, (2, 8, 0)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (9, 8, 1)>, <2, (9, 8, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 3)>, <2, (8, 1, 3)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 5, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <3, (6, 4, 5)>, <3, (6, 4, 2)>, <3, (6, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 5, 2)>, <3, (6, 5, 8)>, <3, (6, 2, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 2)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 2, 8)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 1, 0)>, <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (9, 3, 0)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 0)>, <6, (1, 4, 0)>, <6, (3, 4, 0)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (9, 0, 8)>, <7, (9, 0, 5)>, <7, (9, 8, 5)>, <7, (0, 8, 5)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 2, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <8, (7, 5, 2)>, <8, (7, 5, 3)>, <8, (7, 5, 1)>, <8, (7, 2, 3)>, <8, (7, 2, 1)>, <8, (7, 3, 1)>, <8, (5, 2, 3)>, <8, (5, 2, 1)>, <8, (5, 3, 1)>, <8, (2, 3, 1)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
