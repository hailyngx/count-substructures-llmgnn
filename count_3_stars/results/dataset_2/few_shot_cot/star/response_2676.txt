Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Node 0: Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 1: Neighbors = {6, 3, 15, 14, 4} (5 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 2: Neighbors = {11, 0, 7, 17} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 3: Neighbors = {1, 14} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 4: Neighbors = {9, 1, 15, 5} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 5: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 6: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 7: Neighbors = {16, 2} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 8: Neighbors = {16, 6, 14} (3 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 9: Neighbors = {4, 13} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 10: Neighbors = {15, 18, 13, 14} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 11: Neighbors = {13, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 12: Neighbors = {11, 19, 17} (3 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 13: Neighbors = {11, 9, 15, 10, 19} (5 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
Node 14: Neighbors = {1, 3, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 15: Neighbors = {1, 10, 13, 4} (4 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
Node 16: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 17: Neighbors = {18, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
Node 18: Neighbors = {10, 17} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 19: Neighbors = {13, 12} (2 neighbors)
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
