Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 9, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 2, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 0, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 5, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 9, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
