Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 6, 11, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 14, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 3, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 12, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 10, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 2, 11, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 6, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 6, 5, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 10, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 5, 12, 10, 9} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
