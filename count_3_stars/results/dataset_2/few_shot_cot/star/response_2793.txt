Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Stars: <0, (7, 11, 4)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 7, 12, 10} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
    - 3-Stars: <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 7, 10)>, <1, (5, 12, 10)>, <1, (6, 2, 7)>, <1, (6, 2, 12)>, <1, (6, 7, 12)>, <1, (2, 7, 12)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
    - 3-Stars: <2, (9, 1, 7)>, <2, (9, 1, 11)>, <2, (1, 7, 11)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 12, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
    - 3-Stars: <3, (9, 6, 12)>, <3, (9, 6, 11)>, <3, (9, 6, 10)>, <3, (9, 12, 11)>, <3, (9, 12, 10)>, <3, (9, 11, 10)>, <3, (6, 12, 11)>, <3, (6, 12, 10)>, <3, (6, 11, 10)>, <3, (12, 11, 10)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Stars: <4, (6, 13, 0)>
- **Node 5, 8, and 9**: Cannot form 3-stars as they have less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 12, 0, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
    - 3-Stars: <7, (2, 12, 14)>, <7, (2, 12, 1)>, <7, (2, 0, 14)>, <7, (2, 0, 1)>, <7, (12, 0, 14)>, <7, (12, 0, 1)>
- **Node 10 and 13**: Cannot form 3-stars as they have less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors: {9, 2, 12, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
    - 3-Stars: <11, (9, 2, 12)>, <11, (9, 2, 3)>, <11, (9, 2, 0)>, <11, (9, 12, 3)>, <11, (9, 12, 0)>, <11, (9, 3, 0)>, <11, (2, 12, 3)>, <11, (2, 12, 0)>, <11, (2, 3, 0)>, <11, (12, 3, 0)>
- **Node 14**: Neighbors: {8, 7, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Stars: <14, (8, 7, 10)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
