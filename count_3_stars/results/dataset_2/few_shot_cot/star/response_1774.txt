Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 20, 28, 24} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 2, 13} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
