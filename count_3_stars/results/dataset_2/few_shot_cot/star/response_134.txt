Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 13} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 18, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 7, 12, 4} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 19, 1} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 0, 4} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
