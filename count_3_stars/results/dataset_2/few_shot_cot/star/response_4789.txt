Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 10
