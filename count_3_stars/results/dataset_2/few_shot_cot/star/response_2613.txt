Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars:
    - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
    - <1, (4, 6, 3)>
    - <1, (6, 9, 3)>
    - <1, (4, 9, 3)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
