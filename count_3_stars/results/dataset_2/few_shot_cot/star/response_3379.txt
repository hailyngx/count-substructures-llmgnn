Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 4
