Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 11, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 0, 5, 12, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 10, 2, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8 (4 stars)**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9 (10 stars)**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 0, 9, 6, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 5, 13, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
