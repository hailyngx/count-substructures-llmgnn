Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (15, 19, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
