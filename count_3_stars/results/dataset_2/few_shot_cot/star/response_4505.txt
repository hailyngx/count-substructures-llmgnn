Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 6, 12, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 13, 14, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 11, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 5, 11, 0, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 7, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 4, 2, 9, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 81

Therefore, there are a total of [81] 3-stars in your graph.
