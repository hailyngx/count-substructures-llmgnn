Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 1
