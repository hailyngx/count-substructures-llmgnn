Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 5, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 6, 9, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
