Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 14, 19, 6} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 15, 2} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 1, 17, 3} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 17} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {15, 13} (2 neighbors)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 10**: No neighbors  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 17, 2} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 3} (2 neighbors)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 4} (2 neighbors)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 19} (2 neighbors)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 12, 6} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {16, 13, 3} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 38  

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
