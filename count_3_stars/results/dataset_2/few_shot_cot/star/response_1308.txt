Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 19, 12, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {16, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
