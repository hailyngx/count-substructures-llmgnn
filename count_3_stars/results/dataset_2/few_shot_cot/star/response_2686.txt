Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {27, 7, 16, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
