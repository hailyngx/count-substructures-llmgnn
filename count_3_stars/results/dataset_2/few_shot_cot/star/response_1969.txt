Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 19} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 2, 19} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 16, 17} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 16, 0} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 18, 15, 19} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 18} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 14} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 17} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 16} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 19, 16} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 8} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {19, 8} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 11} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 8, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)

        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 3: 4
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 5: 1
        - From Node 6: 1
        - From Node 8: 4
        - From Node 10: 1
        - From Node 11: 1
        - From Node 12: 1
        - From Node 13: 4
        - From Node 16: 4
        - From Node 17: 1
        - From Node 18: 1
        - From Node 19: 10

        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 35
        
        Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
