Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 5, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
