Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 13} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 6} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 19, 18} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 3} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 14} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 15, 3} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 2, 19} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 5} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 1, 9, 18, 15} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {14, 13} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 12} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 12, 19} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 17} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 15, 18} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
