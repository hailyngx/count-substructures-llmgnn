Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {20, 16, 24, 22} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {25, 5, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {26, 15, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 28} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
