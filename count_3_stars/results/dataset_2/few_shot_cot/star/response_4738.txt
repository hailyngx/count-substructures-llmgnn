- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 57
Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
