Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 5, 8, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 5, 6, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in your graph.
