Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 14, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 17, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 16, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
