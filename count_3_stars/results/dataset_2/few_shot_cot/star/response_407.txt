Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5)

Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 3, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
