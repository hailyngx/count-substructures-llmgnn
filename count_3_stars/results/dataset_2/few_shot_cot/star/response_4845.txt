Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 2, 8, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2, 3, 1, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
