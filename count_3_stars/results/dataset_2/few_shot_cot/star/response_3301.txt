Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 17, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 5, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 14, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {12, 15, 19, 10, 16} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 0, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {0, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
