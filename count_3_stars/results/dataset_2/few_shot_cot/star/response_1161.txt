Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 4, 14, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 17} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 1, 17} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 19, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {19, 0, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 18, 17} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 4, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {16, 1, 15} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 19, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 11, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 11, 14, 17} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
