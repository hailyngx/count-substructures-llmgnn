Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <0, (17, 7, 10)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 4, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (17, 4, 10)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (8, 2, 13)>, <4, (8, 2, 10)>, <4, (8, 13, 10)>, <4, (2, 13, 10)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
