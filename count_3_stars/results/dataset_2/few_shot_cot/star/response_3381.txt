Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 7, 13, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 13, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <3, (17, 13, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <4, (5, 13, 15)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <5, (9, 13, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <7, (5, 12, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 10, 1, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 18, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - <12, (7, 14, 18)>

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {12, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {11, 9, 18, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 20

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in your graph.
