Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 18, 7} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 16} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 8} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 15} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 19, 15} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10, 16, 12} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 15} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 16, 7} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 5} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 15} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {16, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {0, 19} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 5, 17} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
