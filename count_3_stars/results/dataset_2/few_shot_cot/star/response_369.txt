Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {25, 16, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in your graph.
