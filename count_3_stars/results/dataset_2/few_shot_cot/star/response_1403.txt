Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
