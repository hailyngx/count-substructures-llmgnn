Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 8, 11, 3, 4} (6 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8, 13, 14} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {12, 8, 13, 0, 4} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 10} (3 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2} (3 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 14, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 10, 0} (4 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 1, 11, 4} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 84  

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
