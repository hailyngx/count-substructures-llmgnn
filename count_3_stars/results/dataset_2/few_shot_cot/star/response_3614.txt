Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 4, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <6, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 2, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
