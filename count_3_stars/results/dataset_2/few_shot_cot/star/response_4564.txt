Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll compute the number of 3-star configurations for each node with at least three neighbors:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {28, 22, 29, 23} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {19, 23} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {22, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 27} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations calculated above:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in your graph.
