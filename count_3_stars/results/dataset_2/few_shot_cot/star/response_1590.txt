Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 18, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {15, 16, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 8, 12, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {15, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {15, 17, 5, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {15, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
