Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 7, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 0} (3, neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 17, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 17, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 18, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {2, 7, 15, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 13, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 19} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {16, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {16, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
