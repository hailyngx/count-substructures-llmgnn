Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (6, 1, 3)>, <0, (6, 1, 9)>, <0, (6, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (9, 4, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 7, 0, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (9, 6, 7)>, <3, (9, 6, 4)>, <3, (9, 7, 4)>, <3, (6, 7, 4)>, <3, (9, 0, 4)>, <3, (6, 0, 4)>, <3, (7, 0, 4)>, <3, (9, 6, 0)>, <3, (9, 0, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 3, 7, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (5, 6, 1)>, <4, (5, 6, 3)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <4, (6, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>, <4, (6, 3, 7)>, <4, (5, 1, 7)>, <4, (6, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (5, 1, 2)>, <4, (6, 1, 2)>, <4, (5, 3, 2)>, <4, (6, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>, <4, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (6, 7, 2)>, <4, (1, 7, 2)>, <4, (3, 7, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 0)>, <6, (3, 8, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <8, (9, 6, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <9, (5, 2, 3)>, <9, (5, 2, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (8, 2, 3)>, <9, (8, 2, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 0)>, <9, (2, 3, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
