Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 14, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 17, 7, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 4, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 14, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {14, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 11, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {0, 13, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1  
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {9, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
