Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 21, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 21: 1
