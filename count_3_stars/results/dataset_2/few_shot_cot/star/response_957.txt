Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
The nodes that can form a 3-star are: 1, 3, 4, 6, 13, 14, 21, 22, and 24. 
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in the graph.
