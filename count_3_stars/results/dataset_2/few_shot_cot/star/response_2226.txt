Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6
- From nodes with 4 neighbors: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30
Total number of 3-stars = 6 + 30 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in the provided graph.
