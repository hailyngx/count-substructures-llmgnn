Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {18, 14, 11, 19} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 15, 8} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 18, 12, 3} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 4} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {18, 19, 3} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 1, 15} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 10, 3, 13} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 16} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 16} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 13, 12} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 14, 11} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 19} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)

	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {9, 8} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 13} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
