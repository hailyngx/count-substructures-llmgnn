Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
