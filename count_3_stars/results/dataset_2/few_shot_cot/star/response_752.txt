Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 24, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 29, 27} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
