Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 12, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
