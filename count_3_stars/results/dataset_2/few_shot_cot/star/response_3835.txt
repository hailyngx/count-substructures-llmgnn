Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 3, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 15, 16, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 19, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 15, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {19, 15, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 10, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
