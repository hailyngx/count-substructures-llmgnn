Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 6, 13, 12, 5} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 10, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 13, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 14, 10, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 5, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 11, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 9, 4, 12, 6} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 0, 4, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 97

Therefore, there are a total of [97] 3-stars in your graph.
