Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 7, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 14, 4, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 13, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 13, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 14, 11, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 0, 7, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 75

Therefore, there are a total of [75] 3-stars in your graph.
