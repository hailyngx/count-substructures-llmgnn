Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 2, 8, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 1, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 5, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
