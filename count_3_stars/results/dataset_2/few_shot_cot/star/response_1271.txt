Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 16, 11} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 12, 18} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 17, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 16} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 18, 16} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 13} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16, 11, 18} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 10, 13, 19} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 14**: No neighbors
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 4} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 1, 6, 19} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 17} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 3: 4
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 5: 4
        - From Node 6: 1
        - From Node 7: 1
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 10
        - From Node 10: 1
        - From Node 12: 1
        - From Node 13: 1
        - From Node 16: 4
        - From Node 17: 10
        - From Node 18: 4

        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44
        
        Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
