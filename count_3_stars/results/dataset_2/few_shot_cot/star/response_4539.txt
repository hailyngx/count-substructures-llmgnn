Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 6, 2, 4} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 2, 0, 7} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph. These are the unique 3-star subgraphs that can be formed based on the given adjacency list.
