Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 6, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (4, 8, 11)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (9, 13, 14)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <2, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <3, (2, 7, 14)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <5, (9, 8, 11)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <6, (7, 11, 14)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <7, (3, 6, 14)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 11, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <8, (5, 11, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <9, (5, 1, 13)>
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <10, (5, 13, 3)>
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 6, 12, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <11, (5, 6, 0)>
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <12, (1, 11, 13)>
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 1, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <13, (9, 1, 12)>
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 14
Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in your graph.
