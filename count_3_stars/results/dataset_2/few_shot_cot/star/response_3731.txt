Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 2, 11)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (6, 10, 8)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 0, 13, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 13, 4)>, <2, (12, 13, 4)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (7, 2, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 2, 13, 14, 11} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (9, 12, 13)>, <4, (9, 2, 14)>, <4, (12, 13, 14)>, <4, (12, 2, 11)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 0} (3 neighbors)

  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (6, 13, 0)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (5, 1, 10)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 14, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 10)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 12, 13, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-stars: <10, (9, 6, 8)>, <10, (9, 1, 13)>, <10, (9, 12, 8)>, <10, (6, 1, 13)>, <10, (6, 12, 8)>, <10, (1, 13, 8)>

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 0, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <11, (7, 0, 4)>

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: <12, (4, 10, 8)>

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 2, 4, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: <13, (5, 7, 10)>, <13, (5, 2, 4)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
