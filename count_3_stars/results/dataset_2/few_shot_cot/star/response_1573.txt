Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
The unique 3-stars from Node 1 are:
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
The unique 3-stars from Node 2 are:
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 6, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
The unique 3-stars from Node 3 are:
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<3, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
The unique 3-stars from Node 4 are:
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (4, 6, 8)>

<4, (3, 8, 9)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
The unique 3-stars from Node 5 are:
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
The unique 3-stars from Node 6 are:
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
The unique 3-stars from Node 7 are:
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
The unique 3-stars from Node 8 are:
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
The unique 3-stars from Node 9 are:

<9, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 51
Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
