Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17, 12, 19, 6} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {18, 0, 6, 15} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 0, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 15, 10} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 13, 16} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
