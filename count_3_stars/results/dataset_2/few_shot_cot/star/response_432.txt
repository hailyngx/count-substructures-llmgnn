Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 10, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 13, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 14, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 10, 11, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 10, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 14, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 1, 6, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 92

Therefore, there are a total of [92] 3-stars in your graph.
