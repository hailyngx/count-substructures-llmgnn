Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2)

Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 3, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
