Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
