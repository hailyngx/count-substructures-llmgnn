Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 27: 1
