Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 2)>, <1, (4, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 1)>, <2, (4, 6, 3)>, <2, (4, 9, 1)>, <2, (4, 9, 3)>, <2, (4, 1, 3)>, <2, (6, 9, 1)>, <2, (6, 9, 3)>, <2, (6, 1, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 3)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 2)>, <3, (4, 8, 2)>, <3, (7, 8, 2)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 5, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <4, (7, 3, 5)>, <4, (7, 3, 1)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <4, (7, 5, 1)>, <4, (7, 5, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (3, 5, 1)>, <4, (3, 5, 2)>, <4, (3, 1, 2)>, <4, (5, 1, 2)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-stars: <5, (4, 1, 0)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 0)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 9, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <7, (4, 3, 9)>, <7, (4, 3, 8)>, <7, (4, 9, 8)>, <7, (3, 9, 8)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 9, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <8, (7, 0, 9)>, <8, (7, 0, 3)>, <8, (7, 9, 3)>, <8, (0, 9, 3)>

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <9, (7, 0, 8)>, <9, (7, 0, 2)>, <9, (7, 8, 2)>, <9, (0, 8, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
