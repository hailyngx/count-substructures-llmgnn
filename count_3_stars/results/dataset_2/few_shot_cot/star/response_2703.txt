Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 14, 5} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {19, 5, 13} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 18, 5} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 15} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 18} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16, 17, 5} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 14} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 13, 1} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 0, 15} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 10} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 18, 15} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {16, 9, 17, 3} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)

        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 2: 1
        - From Node 3: 1
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 5: 4
        - From Node 6: 1
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 10: 1
        - From Node 12: 4
        - From Node 13: 1
        - From Node 14: 4
        - From Node 15: 1
        - From Node 16: 1
        - From Node 17: 4
        - From Node 18: 4
        
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 29
        Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
