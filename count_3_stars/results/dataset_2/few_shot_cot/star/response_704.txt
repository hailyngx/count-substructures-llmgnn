Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
