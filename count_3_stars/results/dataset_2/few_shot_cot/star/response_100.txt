Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
  - <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 2)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 2)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 2)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>, <0, (1, 8, 2)>, <0, (3, 8, 2)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
  - <1, (3, 5, 0)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 0, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
  - <2, (8, 5, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
  - <3, (6, 9, 1)>, <3, (6, 9, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 0)>, <3, (9, 1, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 0, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
  - <4, (6, 9, 0)>, <4, (6, 9, 5)>, <4, (6, 0, 5)>, <4, (9, 0, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 4, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
  - <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 2)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 2)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (6, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 2)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (4, 2, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 7, 3, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
  - <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <6, (9, 5, 4)>, <6, (9, 7, 3)>, <6, (9, 7, 4)>, <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 7, 4)>, <6, (5, 3, 4)>, <6, (7, 3, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
  - <7, (6, 8, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
  - <8, (1, 2, 0)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 0, 7)>, <8, (2, 0, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
  - <9, (6, 4, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
From Node 0: 10
From Node 1: 4
From Node 2: 1
From Node 3: 4
From Node 4: 4
From Node 5: 10
From Node 6: 10
From Node 7: 1
From Node 8: 4
From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
