Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 12, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 11, 1, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 14, 4} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
