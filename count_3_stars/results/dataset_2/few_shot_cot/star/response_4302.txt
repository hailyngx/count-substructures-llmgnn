Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:  

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 10, 11, 8, 1} (6 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 14} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0, 11, 6, 3} (6 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 12, 11, 4, 7} (6 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 14} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 3, 1, 13} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Summing the valid configurations, we have:  
- From Node 0: 1  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 2: 20  
- From Node 4: 20  
- From Node 5: 20  
- From Node 6: 4  
- From Node 7: 10  
- From Node 9: 1  
- From Node 10: 4  
- From Node 11: 4  
- From Node 12: 1  
- From Node 13: 4  
- From Node 14: 10  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 95  

Therefore, there are a total of [95] 3-stars in your graph.
