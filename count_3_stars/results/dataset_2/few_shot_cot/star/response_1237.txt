Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <0, (5, 4, 6)>, <0, (5, 7, 6)>, <0, (4, 7, 6)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 2, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 2)>, <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <1, (5, 8, 2)>, <1, (5, 8, 6)>, <1, (5, 2, 6)>, <1, (7, 8, 2)>, <1, (7, 8, 6)>, <1, (7, 2, 6)>, <1, (8, 2, 6)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 4, 6)>, <2, (9, 8, 1)>, <2, (9, 8, 6)>, <2, (9, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 6)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>, <2, (8, 1, 6)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <3, (5, 9, 7)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <4, (9, 0, 2)>
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 0)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 0)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (8, 1, 0)>, <5, (8, 1, 3)>, <5, (8, 0, 3)>, <5, (1, 0, 3)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <6, (8, 2, 0)>, <6, (8, 2, 1)>, <6, (8, 0, 1)>, <6, (2, 0, 1)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <7, (0, 3, 1)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <8, (5, 2, 6)>, <8, (5, 2, 1)>, <8, (5, 6, 1)>, <8, (2, 6, 1)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 2, 3)>, <9, (4, 2, 3)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
