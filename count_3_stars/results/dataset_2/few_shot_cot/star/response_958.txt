Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (1, 3, 5)>
  - <0, (1, 3, 4)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
  - <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 5, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <1, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <1, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <1, (0, 5, 9)>

  - <1, (2, 6, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 5, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <3, (0, 5, 9)>
  - <3, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <4, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 1, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

  - <5, (3, 4, 8)>
  - <5, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <5, (0, 3, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (1, 3, 4)>
  - <6, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <6, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <8, (4, 5, 7)>
  - <8, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 9)>

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <9, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <9, (1, 2, 8)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 3)>
  - <9, (1, 3, 8)>
  - <9, (6, 3, 8)>
  - <9, (1, 3, 0)>
  - <9, (1, 0, 8)>
  - <9, (3, 0, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
