Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
