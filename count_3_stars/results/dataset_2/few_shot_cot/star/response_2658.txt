Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 7, 12, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 0, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 14, 10, 3, 0} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 8, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 11, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 11, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 73

Therefore, there are a total of [73] 3-stars in your graph.
