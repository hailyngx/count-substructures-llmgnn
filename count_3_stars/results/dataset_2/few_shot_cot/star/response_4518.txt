Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {1, 18, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
