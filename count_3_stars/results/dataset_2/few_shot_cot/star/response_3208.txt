Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {14, 9, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 19, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 16, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 18} (2 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 19, 15, 13} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 13, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 14, 2, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
