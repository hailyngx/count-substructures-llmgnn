Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {23, 29} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 3, 28} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 21, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 10
