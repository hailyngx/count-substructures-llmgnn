Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 17, 11, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 15, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {2, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 18, 0, 6, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {18, 15, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
