Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll go through each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 17} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 15, 6, 4} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
