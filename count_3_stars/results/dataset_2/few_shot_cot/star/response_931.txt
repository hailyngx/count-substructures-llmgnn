Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Here, we'll go through each node to determine the number of 3-star configurations. 

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 8, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 7, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in the given graph.
