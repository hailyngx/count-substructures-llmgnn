Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 14, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 14, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 13, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3, 11, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 5, 0, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 10, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 7, 8, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 67

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in your graph.
