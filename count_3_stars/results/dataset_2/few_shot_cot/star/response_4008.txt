Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 8, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 12, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 10, 3, 11, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 3, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 10, 11, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 8, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 69

Therefore, there are a total of [69] 3-stars in your graph.
