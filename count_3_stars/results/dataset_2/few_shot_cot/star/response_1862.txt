    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 4  
- From Node 1: 4  
- From Node 2: 10  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 5: 10  
- From Node 6: 10  
- From Node 7: 4  
- From Node 8: 1  
- From Node 9: 4  
- From Node 11: 4  
- From Node 12: 4  
- From Node 13: 4  
- From Node 14: 10  
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10  
Total number of 3-stars = 70  

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
