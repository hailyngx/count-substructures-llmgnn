Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 1, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 14, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 1, 3, 2, 5} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 11, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
