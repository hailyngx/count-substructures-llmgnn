Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 10
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
