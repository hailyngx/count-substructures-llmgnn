Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 14, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 4, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 14, 7, 6, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(6, 3) = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 10, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 7, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5, 3) = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4, 3) = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(3, 3) = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
