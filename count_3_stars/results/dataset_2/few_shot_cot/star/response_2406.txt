Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0)

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll follow the same procedure outlined in the example. 

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 6, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 1, 4, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 3, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
