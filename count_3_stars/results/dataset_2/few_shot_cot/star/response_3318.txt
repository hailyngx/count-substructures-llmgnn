Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 2, 15, 18} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 9, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 2, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 16} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 14, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 18, 16} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {0, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 8, 15, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 18: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
