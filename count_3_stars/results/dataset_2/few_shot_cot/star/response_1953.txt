Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - **From Node 1**: <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (5, 9, 3)>, <1, (6, 9, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 9, 2)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (6, 9, 2)>, <1, (6, 3, 2)>, <1, (9, 3, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **From Node 2**: <2, (9, 6, 1)>, <2, (9, 6, 4)>, <2, (1, 6, 4)>, <2, (9, 1, 4)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - **From Node 3**: <3, (5, 9, 1)>, <3, (5, 9, 8)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, <3, (9, 1, 8)>, <3, (5, 1, 7)>, <3, (9, 1, 7)>, <3, (9, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **From Node 4**: <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <4, (8, 2, 0)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **From Node 5**: <5, (8, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 3)>, <5, (8, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 2, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - **From Node 6**: <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <6, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>, <6, (1, 2, 0)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (2, 8, 0)>, <6, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - **From Node 8**: <8, (5, 6, 3)>, <8, (5, 6, 4)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 3, 4)>, <8, (5, 3, 7)>, <8, (6, 3, 4)>, <8, (6, 4, 7)>, <8, (6, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>, <8, (5, 4, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - **From Node 9**: <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 2, 1)>, <9, (6, 3, 1)>, <9, (2, 3, 1)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
