Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 14, 7, 12, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 12, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 13, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 2, 5, 14, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 1, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 3, 14, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 5, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 10, 11, 0, 1, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 105

Therefore, there are a total of [105] 3-stars in your graph.
