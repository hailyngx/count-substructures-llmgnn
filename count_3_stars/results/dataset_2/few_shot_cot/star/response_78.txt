Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 0, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 5, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 1, 3, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 0
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
