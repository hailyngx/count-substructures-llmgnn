Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Counting all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
