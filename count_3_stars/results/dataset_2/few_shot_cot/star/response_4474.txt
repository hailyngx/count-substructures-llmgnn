Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
