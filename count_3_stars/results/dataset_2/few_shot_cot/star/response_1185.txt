Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 15, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 17, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <3, (8, 9, 17)>, <3, (8, 9, 4)>, <3, (8, 17, 4)>, <3, (9, 17, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 12)>, <4, (2, 6, 12)>, <4, (3, 6, 12)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 18, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <6, (9, 10, 18)>, <6, (9, 10, 4)>, <6, (9, 18, 4)>, <6, (10, 18, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {18, 0, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 10} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {11, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in the given graph.
