Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 11} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 10, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 66
Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
