Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 11, 16, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 0
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 0
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 0
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 0
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 0
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 0

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 47

Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
