Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will now compute the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 16, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <0, (1, 16, 12)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 14, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <2, (12, 14, 15)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 19, 8, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <3, (16, 19, 8)>, <3, (16, 19, 18)>, <3, (16, 8, 18)>, <3, (19, 8, 18)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 15} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <11, (9, 13, 14)>

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <12, (0, 2, 14)>

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in the given graph.
