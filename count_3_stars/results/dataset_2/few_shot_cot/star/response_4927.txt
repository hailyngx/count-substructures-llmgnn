  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {19, 18, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 19} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
