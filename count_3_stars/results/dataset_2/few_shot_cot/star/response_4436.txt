Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
