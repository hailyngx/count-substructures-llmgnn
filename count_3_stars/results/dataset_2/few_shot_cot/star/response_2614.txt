Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
  <1, (9, 6, 2)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
  <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 4, 6)>, <2, (9, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 1, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)>, <2, (9, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
  <3, (4, 7, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
  <4, (9, 3, 6)>, <4, (9, 3, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 2)>, <4, (3, 6, 2)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
  <5, (9, 6, 8)>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
  <6, (5, 4, 1)>, <6, (5, 4, 2)>, <6, (5, 4, 0)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 0)>, <6, (5, 2, 0)>, <6, (4, 1, 2)>, <6, (4, 1, 0)>, <6, (4, 2, 0)>, <6, (1, 2, 0)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
  <7, (9, 3, 8)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 3, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
  <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (5, 9, 3)>, <8, (5, 9, 2)>, <8, (5, 7, 3)>, <8, (5, 7, 2)>, <8, (5, 3, 2)>, <8, (9, 7, 3)>, <8, (9, 7, 2)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>, <8, (7, 3, 2)>, <8, (5, 9, 0)>, <8, (5, 7, 0)>, <8, (5, 3, 0)>, <8, (9, 7, 0)>, <8, (9, 3, 0)>, <8, (7, 3, 0)>, <8, (5, 2, 0)>, <8, (9, 2, 0)>, <8, (7, 2, 0)>, <8, (3, 2, 0)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 2, 1, 7} (6 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
  <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 2, 1)>, <9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 2, 1)>, <9, (8, 2, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 2: 10  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 5: 1  
- From Node 6: 10  
- From Node 7: 1  
- From Node 8: 20  
- From Node 9: 20  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 20 = 68  

Therefore, there are a total of [68] 3-stars in your graph.
