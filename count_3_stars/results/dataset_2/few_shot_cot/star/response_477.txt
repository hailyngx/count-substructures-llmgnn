Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
