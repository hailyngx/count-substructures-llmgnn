Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 12, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 5, 14, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 19, 12, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 5, 1, 17} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 15, 14, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {15, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {8, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {18, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {16, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
