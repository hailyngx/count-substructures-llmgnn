Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3)

Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 1, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0, 8, 2, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
