Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 19, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
