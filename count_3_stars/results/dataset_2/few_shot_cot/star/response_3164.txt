Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
