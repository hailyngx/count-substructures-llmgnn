Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 1  
- From Node 1: 4  
- From Node 2: 10  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 5: 4  
- From Node 6: 4  
- From Node 7: 10  
- From Node 8: 4  
- From Node 10: 10  
- From Node 12: 10  
- From Node 14: 10  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 72  

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
