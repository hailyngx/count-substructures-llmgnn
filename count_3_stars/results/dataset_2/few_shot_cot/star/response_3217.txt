Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 10
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 10
- From Node 28: 1
