Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (9, 8, 5)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <1, (8, 2, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <2, (7, 8, 5)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 9, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 9, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 9, 5, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 9, 5)>, <4, (7, 3, 9)>, <4, (8, 9, 5)>, <4, (8, 5, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <5, (4, 2, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <7, (4, 3, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 0, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 3, 1)>, <8, (7, 2, 3)>, <8, (7, 3, 1)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <9, (4, 6, 3)>, <9, (4, 3, 0)>, <9, (6, 3, 0)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 5
- From Node 4: 5
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 5
- From Node 9: 3

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 3 = 23

Therefore, there are a total of [23] 3-stars in the given graph.
