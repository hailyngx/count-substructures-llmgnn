Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 10, 17, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16, 13, 19, 5} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 6, 19, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {19, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 17, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {15, 1, 13, 9, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 40
Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
