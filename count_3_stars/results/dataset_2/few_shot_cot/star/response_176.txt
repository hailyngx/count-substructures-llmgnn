Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:   
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 2: 4  
- From Node 3: 4  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 5: 4  
- From Node 6: 10  
- From Node 7: 4  
- From Node 8: 1  
- From Node 10: 4  
- From Node 11: 10  
- From Node 12: 4  
- From Node 13: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 74  

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in your graph.
