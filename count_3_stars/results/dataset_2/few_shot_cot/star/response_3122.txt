Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 8)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 8)>  

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <2, (4, 3, 5)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <4, (7, 9, 0)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 1, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <5, (6, 1, 2)> 

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <6, (5, 8, 0)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <7, (3, 9, 5)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 5)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-star: <9, (7, 6, 1)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
