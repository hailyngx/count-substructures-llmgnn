Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 17} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {18, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 14, 8, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 2, 16} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 0, 16, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
