Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 4
