Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12, 1, 18, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 11} (3 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 16, 15, 18} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
