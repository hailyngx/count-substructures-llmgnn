Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2, 9, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
