Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
	Add up all the valid configurations:
    - From Node 0: 4
    - From Node 1: 4
    - From Node 2: 4
    - From Node 3: 1
    - From Node 4: 4
    - From Node 5: 20
    - From Node 6: 4
    - From Node 7: 1
    - From Node 8: 1
    - From Node 9: 1
    - From Node 10: 20
    - From Node 11: 1
    - From Node 12: 4
    - From Node 13: 1
    - From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 = 85

Therefore, there are a total of [85] 3-stars in your graph.
