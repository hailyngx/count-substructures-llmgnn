Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2)

Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 0, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:

- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
