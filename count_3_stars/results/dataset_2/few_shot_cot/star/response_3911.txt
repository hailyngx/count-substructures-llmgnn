Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 13, 2, 12} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 12, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 0, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 3, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (<5, (9, 2, 1)>)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<6, (9, 14, 13)>)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 11, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 10 (<10, (5, 9, 7)>)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 12, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (<13, (6, 1, 12)>)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Less than 3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
From Node 0: 20
From Node 5: 10
From Node 6: 4
From Node 13: 4
From Node 10: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
