Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 16, 23} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 29, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 22} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
