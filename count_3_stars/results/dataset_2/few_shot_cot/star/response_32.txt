Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <0, (5, 4, 3)>, <0, (5, 4, 1)>, <0, (4, 7, 3)>, <0, (4, 7, 1)>, <0, (4, 3, 1)>, <0, (7, 3, 1)>, <0, (5, 7, 3)>, <0, (5, 7, 1)>, <0, (5, 3, 1)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 6, 2)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <2, (5, 9, 6)>, <2, (5, 9, 1)>, <2, (5, 9, 3)>, <2, (5, 6, 1)>, <2, (5, 6, 3)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (9, 6, 1)>, <2, (9, 6, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 3)>, <2, (6, 1, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 7, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, 2)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, <3, (4, 6, 2)>, <3, (4, 6, 0)>, <3, (4, 2, 0)>, <3, (7, 6, 2)>, <3, (7, 6, 0)>, <3, (7, 2, 0)>, <3, (6, 2, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (9, 7, 0)>, <4, (9, 7, 1)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 0, 1)>, <4, (9, 0, 3)>, <4, (9, 1, 3)>, <4, (7, 0, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 3)>, <4, (7, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (3, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
