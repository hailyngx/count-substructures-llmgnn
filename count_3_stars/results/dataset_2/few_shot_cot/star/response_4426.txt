        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 12, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)

        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 1, 5} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 1: 10
        - From Node 2: 20
        - From Node 3: 1
        - From Node 4: 4
        - From Node 5: 4
        - From Node 6: 4
        - From Node 7: 1
        - From Node 8: 10
        - From Node 9: 1
        - From Node 10: 4
        - From Node 11: 4
        - From Node 12: 4
        - From Node 13: 4
        - From Node 14: 4
        
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 66
        
        Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
