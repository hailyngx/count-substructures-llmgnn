Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <4, (7, 9, 5)>, <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (7, 5, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 6)>, <4, (7, 5, 3)>, <4, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 6, 3)>, <4, (9, 5, 3)>, <4, (9, 6, 3)>, <4, (5, 6, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 2, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <5, (4, 6, 2)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (4, 2, 0)>, <5, (4, 8, 0)>, <5, (6, 8, 0)>, <5, (2, 8, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (4, 9, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 9, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <7, (4, 9, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 5)>, <8, (1, 9, 5)>, <8, (6, 9, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 6, 8, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <9, (4, 7, 3)>, <9, (4, 7, 6)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 3, 6)>, <9, (4, 3, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 8)>, <9, (7, 3, 6)>, <9, (7, 3, 8)>, <9, (7, 6, 8)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
