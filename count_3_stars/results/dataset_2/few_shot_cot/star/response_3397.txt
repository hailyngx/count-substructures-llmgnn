Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 10, 11, 5, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 11, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 2, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 12, 1, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 8, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 11, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 5, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 5, 3, 10, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 90

Therefore, there are a total of [90] 3-stars in your graph.
