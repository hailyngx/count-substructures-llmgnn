Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 25: 10
