Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in the graph provided by applying the combinatorial formula:

1. **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 1, 19} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
2. **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 16, 18} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

3. **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 17, 0} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

4. **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

5. **Node 5**: Neighbors = {18, 15, 7} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

6. **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 17, 14} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

7. **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

8. **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 13, 19} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

9. **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 12} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

10. **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

11. **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 16, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

12. **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

13. **Node 15**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 16, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

14. **Node 16**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 19, 15} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

15. **Node 18**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 1, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

16. **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 16} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in the graph provided.
