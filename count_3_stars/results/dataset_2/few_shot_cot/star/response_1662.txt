Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 16, 17, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 19, 1, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 7} (2 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
