Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
1. **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 14, 10, 11} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

2. **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 10} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

3. **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

4. **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 12, 10, 7} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

5. **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 0, 14, 3} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

6. **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

7. **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

8. **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 9, 2, 3} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

9. **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 9, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

10. **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 11, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

11. **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 12, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

12. **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

13. **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 2, 10, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

14. **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

15. **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 93

Therefore, there are a total of [93] 3-stars in your graph.
