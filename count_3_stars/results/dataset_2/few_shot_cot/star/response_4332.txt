Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 18, 12, 9} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 6, 11} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 10, 5, 18} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 11, 15} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 17, 2, 11, 19} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 0, 15} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)

	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 17} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 47

Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
