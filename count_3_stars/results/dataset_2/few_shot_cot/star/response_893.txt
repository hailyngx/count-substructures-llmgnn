Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 11, 4, 8, 13} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 10, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 11, 9, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 11, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 7, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 3, 1, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 0, 3, 9, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 75

Therefore, there are a total of [75] 3-stars in your graph.
