Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 11, 7, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 4, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 7, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 13, 2, 8, 4} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 10, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 8, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
