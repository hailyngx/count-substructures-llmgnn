Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 8, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 3, 4} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
