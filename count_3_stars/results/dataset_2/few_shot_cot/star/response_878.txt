Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 10, 4, 12, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 12, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 10, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 10, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 0, 7, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 14, 7, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 85

Therefore, there are a total of [85] 3-stars in your graph.
