Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars: 
        - <0, (5, 9, 8)>
        - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
        - <0, (9, 6, 8)>
        - <0, (5, 9, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 7, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - 3-Stars:
        - <1, (5, 4, 7)>
        - <1, (5, 4, 2)>

        - <1, (4, 7, 6)>
        - <1, (4, 2, 6)>
        - <1, (7, 2, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - 3-Stars:
        - <2, (5, 1, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars:
        - <3, (5, 4, 7)>
        - <3, (5, 4, 2)>
        - <3, (5, 7, 2)>
        - <3, (4, 7, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)

        - <4, (9, 3, 1)>
        - <4, (8, 3, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 0, 3, 7} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - 3-Stars:
        - <5, (9, 2, 1)>
        - <5, (9, 2, 0)>
        - <5, (9, 2, 3)>
        - <5, (9, 2, 7)>
        - <5, (9, 1, 0)>
        - <5, (9, 1, 3)>
        - <5, (9, 1, 7)>

        - <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars:
        - <7, (5, 3, 1)>
        - <7, (5, 3, 8)>
        - <7, (5, 1, 8)>
        - <7, (3, 1, 8)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars:

        - <8, (9, 4, 0)>
        - <8, (9, 7, 0)>
        - <8, (4, 7, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - 3-Stars:

        - <9, (5, 8, 0)>
        - <9, (5, 4, 0)>
        - <9, (8, 4, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
