Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node: 
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 7, 2} (4 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 4, 8} (4 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 11, 7, 13, 0} (6 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 13} (3 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10, 7} (4 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 8, 1, 0, 10} (5 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors) 
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors. 
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 0, 2, 13} (5 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 12, 14} (5 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3} (3 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 4} (3 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 2} (3 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 14, 8} (4 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 7, 12, 2} (5 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 12, 8} (4 neighbors) 
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations: 
- From Node 0: 4 
- From Node 1: 4 
- From Node 2: 20 
- From Node 3: 1 
- From Node 4: 4 
- From Node 5: 10 
- From Node 7: 10 
- From Node 8: 10 
- From Node 9: 1 
- From Node 10: 1 
- From Node 11: 1 
- From Node 12: 4 
- From Node 13: 10 
- From Node 14: 4 

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 84 
Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
