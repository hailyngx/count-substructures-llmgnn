Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11, 7, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 10, 2, 5, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 3, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 5, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 12, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 1, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 8, 5, 0, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 97

Therefore, there are a total of [97] 3-stars in your graph.
