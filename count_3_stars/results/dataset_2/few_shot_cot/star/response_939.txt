Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 16, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
