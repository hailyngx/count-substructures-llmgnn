Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 1, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 11, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 17, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 13, 11, 17} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 18, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 16, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {6, 17, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {15, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 3, 15, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 16, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
