Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 4
