Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 3, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 8: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
