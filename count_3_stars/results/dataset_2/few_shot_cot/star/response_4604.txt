Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(0\) (less than 3 neighbors)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(0\) (less than 3 neighbors)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(0\) (less than 3 neighbors)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 0, 3, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 10, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 10, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(0\) (less than 3 neighbors)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 10 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
