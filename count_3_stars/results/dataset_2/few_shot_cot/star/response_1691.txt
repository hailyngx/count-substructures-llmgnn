Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
