Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 12, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {14, 18, 11, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 10, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 16, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 4, 2, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {14, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {19, 15, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {17, 4, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 16, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
