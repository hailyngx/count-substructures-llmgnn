Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 4, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 2, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 1, 11} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 12, 7, 10} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 0, 12, 10} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 2, 4} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {13, 11, 1, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
