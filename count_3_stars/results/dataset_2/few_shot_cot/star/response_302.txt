Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 0, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 6, 1, 3, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(0\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
