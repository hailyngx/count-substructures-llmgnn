Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 18, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 12, 18, 16} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 19} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 16, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {18, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 15} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {17, 3, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 16, 5} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
