Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 9, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 10, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 14, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 10, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 2, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 7, 2, 5, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 9, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 14, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 4, 13, 6, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
