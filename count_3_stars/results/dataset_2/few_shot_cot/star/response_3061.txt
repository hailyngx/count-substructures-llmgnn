Response:
The calculation of the number of 3-stars in the provided graph is as follows:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 5, 29, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5,3) = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 4, 18, 20, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(5,3) = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 13, 24} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(C(4,3) = 4\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in your graph.
