Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node to determine the number of 3-star configurations:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {29, 28, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 22, 1, 21} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 26, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 29, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 10
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 62
