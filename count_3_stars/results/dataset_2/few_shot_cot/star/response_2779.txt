Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 19, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 8, 4, 15, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 12, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 18, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 12} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {18, 15, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 3, 6, 19} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 0, 15} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
