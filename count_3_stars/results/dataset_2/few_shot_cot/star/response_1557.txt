Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 1, 9, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 19, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 19, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 17, 9} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 15, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 19, 14} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {7, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 6, 3, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
