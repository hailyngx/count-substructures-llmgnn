Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
