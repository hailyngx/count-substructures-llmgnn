Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {22, 7, 15, 29} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {26, 17, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {22, 8, 1, 16, 21} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {25, 11, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 21, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {25, 26, 0, 29, 28} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {23, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9, 28} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {23, 20, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {8, 26, 17, 0, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 27, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 22**: Neighbors = {23, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 23**: Neighbors = {22, 8, 14, 28} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 25**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 26**: Neighbors = {1, 15, 11, 27, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 27**: Neighbors = {26, 17, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 28**: Neighbors = {23, 20, 7, 10, 24} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
From Node 0: 4
From Node 1: 4
From Node 2: 10
From Node 3: 1
From Node 4: 1
From Node 7: 10
From Node 8: 1
From Node 10: 4
From Node 14: 4
From Node 15: 10
From Node 17: 1
From Node 22: 1
From Node 23: 4
From Node 26: 10
From Node 27: 1
From Node 28: 10
From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in your graph.
