Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <0, (9, 3, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (9, 6, 2)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (9, 2, 8)>, <1, (6, 2, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 8, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)>, <2, (9, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 1, 8)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 6)>, <2, (9, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <3, (7, 0, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <4, (5, 6, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (6, 8, 4)>, <5, (6, 8, 7)>, <5, (6, 4, 7)>, <5, (8, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 1, 3, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <6, (5, 7, 4)>, <6, (5, 7, 1)>, <6, (5, 4, 1)>, <6, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 1, 3)>, <6, (5, 4, 3)>, <6, (7, 4, 1)>, <6, (7, 4, 3)>, <6, (7, 1, 3)>, <6, (4, 1, 3)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <6, (5, 4, 2)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (7, 4, 2)>, <6, (7, 1, 2)>, <6, (7, 3, 2)>, <6, (4, 1, 2)>, <6, (4, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 3, 6)>, <7, (9, 3, 6)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <8, (5, 1, 2)>, <8, (5, 1, 0)>, <8, (5, 2, 0)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 0)>, <9, (2, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
