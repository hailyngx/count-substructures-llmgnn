Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms 1 unique 3-star configuration. If it has more than 3 neighbors, we will calculate \( \binom{n}{3} \) where \( n \) is the number of neighbors for that node.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-star configurations: <1, (8, 11, 13)>, <1, (8, 11, 10)>, <1, (8, 13, 10)>, <1, (11, 13, 10)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-star configurations: <2, (7, 12, 13)>, <2, (7, 12, 0)>, <2, (7, 13, 0)>, <2, (12, 13, 0)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 11, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 14, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-star configurations: <4, (5, 7, 14)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <4, (5, 14, 3)>, <4, (7, 14, 3)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 4, 3, 10} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-star configurations: <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 13)>, <7, (9, 2, 13)>, <7, (4, 2, 13)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 10, 7, 13} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 1, 14} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 3, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 14, 11} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 12, 3, 10} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Summing up the 3-star configurations for each node:
1 (from Node 0) + 4 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 2) + 10 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 5) + 4 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 8) + 10 (from Node 9) + 10 (from Node 10) + 10 (from Node 11) + 1 (from Node 12) + 10 (from Node 13) + 10 (from Node 14) = 85

Therefore, there are a total of [85] 3-stars in the given graph.
