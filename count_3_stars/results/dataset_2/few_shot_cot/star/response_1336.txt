Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node: 

- **Node 0**: No neighbors, cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 10} (2 neighbors), cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)

  - <2, (11, 6, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars: 

- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
