Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 16, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 22, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4

- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 10
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 10
