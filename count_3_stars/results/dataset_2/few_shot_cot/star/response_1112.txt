Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {28, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 10
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 47

Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
