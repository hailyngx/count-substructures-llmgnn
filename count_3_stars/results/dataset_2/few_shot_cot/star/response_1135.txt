Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {26, 28, 9, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {22, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 22: 10
- From Node 24: 10
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
