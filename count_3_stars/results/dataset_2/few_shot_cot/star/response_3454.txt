Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {20, 19, 22} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 24, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
