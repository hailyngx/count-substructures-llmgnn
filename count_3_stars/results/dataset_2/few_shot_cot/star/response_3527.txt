Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 17, 12, 19} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {19, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 17, 18, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 5, 0, 18} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 17} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 16**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {15, 10, 19, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 17, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
