Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6)

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <3, (9, 1, 6)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (5, 2, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <5, (9, 4, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 2)>, <6, (5, 2, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <7, (5, 2, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <8, (4, 3, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 3, 1, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 1, 0)>, <9, (4, 1, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 3
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 3
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
