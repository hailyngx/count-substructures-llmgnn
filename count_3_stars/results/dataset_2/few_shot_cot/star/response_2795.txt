Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 28: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
