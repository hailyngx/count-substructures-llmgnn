Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 8, 1, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
