Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
