Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 5, 9, 8} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 6, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 5, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 1} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 1: 10
        - From Node 2: 1
        - From Node 3: 4
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 5: 10
        - From Node 6: 10
        - From Node 7: 4
        - From Node 8: 10
        - From Node 9: 1
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 52
        
        Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
