Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 11, 10, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 75

Therefore, there are a total of [75] 3-stars in your graph.
