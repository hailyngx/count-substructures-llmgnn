Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 10
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 10
- From Node 27: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
