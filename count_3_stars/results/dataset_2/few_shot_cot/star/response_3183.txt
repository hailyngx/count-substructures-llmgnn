Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].

Calculations for each node are as follows:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 19, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( C(4,3) = 4 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 29} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
