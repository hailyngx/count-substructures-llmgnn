Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 2, 7, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 0, 12, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 6, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 12, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8, 6, 12, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
