Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 10
