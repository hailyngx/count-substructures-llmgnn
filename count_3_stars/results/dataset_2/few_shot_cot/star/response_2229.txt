Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <0, (5, 9, 8)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (5, 8, 2)>, <0, (9, 8, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (3, 6, 2)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>, <1, (6, 2, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 8, 0, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <2, (4, 1, 3)>, <2, (4, 1, 8)>, <2, (4, 1, 0)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 3, 8)>, <2, (4, 3, 0)>, <2, (4, 3, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 6)>, <2, (4, 0, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 0)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 8, 0)>, <2, (1, 8, 6)>, <2, (1, 0, 6)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <2, (3, 0, 6)>, <2, (8, 0, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <3, (5, 7, 1)>, <3, (5, 7, 6)>, <3, (5, 7, 2)>, <3, (5, 1, 6)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (7, 1, 6)>, <3, (7, 1, 2)>, <3, (7, 6, 2)>, <3, (1, 6, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)

  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 2)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <8, (4, 1, 2)>, <8, (4, 1, 0)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <9, (5, 4, 0)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
