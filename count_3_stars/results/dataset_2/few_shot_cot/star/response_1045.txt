Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 15, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 19} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
