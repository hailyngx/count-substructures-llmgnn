Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 11, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 13, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 11, 12, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 14, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 11, 10, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 11, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 0, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {13, 7, 0, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
