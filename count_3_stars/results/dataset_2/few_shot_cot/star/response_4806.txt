Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 5, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-Stars: 
    - <2, (4, 9, 5)>
    - <2, (4, 9, 8)>
    - <2, (4, 8, 0)>
    - <2, (9, 5, 8)>
    - <2, (9, 8, 0)>
    - <2, (5, 8, 0)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 9, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-Stars: 
    - <8, (3, 6, 9)>
    - <8, (3, 9, 2)>
    - <8, (3, 2, 0)>
    - <8, (6, 9, 2)>
    - <8, (6, 2, 0)>
    - <8, (9, 2, 0)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-Stars: 
    - <9, (7, 1, 8)>
    - <9, (7, 1, 2)>
    - <9, (7, 1, 0)>
    - <9, (7, 8, 2)>
    - <9, (7, 8, 0)>
    - <9, (7, 2, 0)>
    - <9, (1, 8, 2)>
    - <9, (1, 8, 0)>
    - <9, (1, 2, 0)>
    - <9, (8, 2, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
