Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 11, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 11, 13, 14, 1} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 10, 13, 5} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 13, 0, 10} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 3, 12, 4, 0} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 3, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {12, 3, 5, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 10, 11} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 2, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 89

Therefore, there are a total of [89] 3-stars in your graph.
