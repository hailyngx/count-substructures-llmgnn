Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll now examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 18, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (15, 18, 12)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
