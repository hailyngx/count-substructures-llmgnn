Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 7, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 19, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 16, 1} (4 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {17, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {15, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {18, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
