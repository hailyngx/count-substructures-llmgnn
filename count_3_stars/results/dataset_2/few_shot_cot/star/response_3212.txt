Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 15, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 0, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {12, 18, 15, 16} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 1, 7, 5, 18} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {13, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
