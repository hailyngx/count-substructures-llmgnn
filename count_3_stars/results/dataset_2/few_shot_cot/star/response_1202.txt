Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
