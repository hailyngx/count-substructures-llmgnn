Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {18, 19, 16} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
