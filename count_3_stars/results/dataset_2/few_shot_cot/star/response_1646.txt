Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 4, 10, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 19, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 17, 10} (3 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 18} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
