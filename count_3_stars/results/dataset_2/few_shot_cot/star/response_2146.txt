Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph by analyzing each node one by one based on the given adjacency list:
  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 16, 17} (3 neighbors)

- From Node 12: 10 3-stars
- From Node 15: 10 3-stars

- From Node 18: 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in the given graph.
