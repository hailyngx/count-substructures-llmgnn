Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 0, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 13, 14, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 3, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 0, 2, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 8, 2, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 14, 6, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 9, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 11, 10, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5, 12, 11, 1} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:

Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 20
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 79

Therefore, there are a total of [79] 3-stars in your graph.
