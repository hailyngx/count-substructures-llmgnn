Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (14, 12, 1)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0, 14, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (4, 7, 14)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 14, 12)>, <1, (0, 14, 2)>, <1, (0, 12, 2)>, <1, (2, 7, 13)>, <1, (2, 13, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 12, 1, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (9, 3, 1)>, <2, (9, 3, 10)>, <2, (9, 1, 10)>, <2, (3, 11, 13)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 11, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 12, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14, 13, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 5, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 2, 13)>, <9, (6, 3, 13)>, <9, (2, 3, 13)>, <9, (2, 12, 10)>
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 0, 2, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <12, (6, 9, 2)>, <12, (6, 9, 10)>, <12, (6, 0, 14)>, <12, (6, 2, 10)>, <12, (9, 3, 13)>
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3, 11, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <13, (9, 7, 3)>, <13, (9, 7, 11)>, <13, (9, 7, 5)>, <13, (9, 3, 11)>, <13, (9, 3, 5)>
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
