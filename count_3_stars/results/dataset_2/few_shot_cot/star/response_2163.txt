Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 8, 1, 13, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 11, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 3, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 2, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {12, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 3, 1, 4, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Isolated node with no neighbors.
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 11: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60
Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
