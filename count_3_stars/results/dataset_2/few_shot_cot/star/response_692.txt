Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4 possibilities
- From Node 1: 20 possibilities
- From Node 2: 4 possibilities
- From Node 3: 4 possibilities
- From Node 6: 10 possibilities
- From Node 7: 4 possibilities
- From Node 8: 10 possibilities
- From Node 9: 4 possibilities
- From Node 12: 10 possibilities
- From Node 13: 4 possibilities
- From Node 14: 4 possibilities

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 78

Therefore, there are a total of [78] 3-stars in your graph.
