Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
