Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 12, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 7} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 11, 2, 12} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 10, 6} (4 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 11, 3} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 4} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 14, 2} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 11, 6, 12} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 12} (2 neighbors)  
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 8, 13, 4} (5 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 8, 4, 10} (6 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 11, 14, 6} (6 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 7} (3 neighbors)  
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 1: 10  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 3: 10  
- From Node 5: 1  
- From Node 6: 1  
- From Node 7: 10  
- From Node 8: 10  
- From Node 11: 10  
- From Node 12: 20  
- From Node 13: 20  
- From Node 14: 1  

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 1 = 84  
Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
