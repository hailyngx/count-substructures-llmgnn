Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 15, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 19, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 9, 3} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 16, 18} (4 neighbors)

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 19, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
