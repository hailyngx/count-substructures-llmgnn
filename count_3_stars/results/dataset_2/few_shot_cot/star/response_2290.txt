Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 6, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Possible 3-stars: <0, (4, 7, 1)>, <0, (4, 7, 6)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 1, 6)>, <0, (4, 1, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (7, 1, 6)>, <0, (7, 1, 8)>, <0, (7, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 2, 5, 0, 8} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - Possible 3-stars: <1, (7, 3, 2)>, <1, (7, 3, 5)>, <1, (7, 3, 0)>, <1, (7, 3, 8)>, <1, (7, 2, 5)>, <1, (7, 2, 0)>, <1, (7, 2, 8)>, <1, (7, 5, 0)>, <1, (7, 5, 8)>, <1, (7, 0, 8)>, <1, (3, 2, 5)>, <1, (3, 2, 0)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 0)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 0, 8)>, <1, (2, 5, 0)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 0, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Possible 3-stars: <2, (4, 1, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Possible 3-stars: <3, (4, 1, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 0, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Possible 3-stars: <4, (7, 9, 0)>, <4, (7, 9, 3)>, <4, (7, 9, 2)>, <4, (7, 0, 3)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <4, (9, 0, 3)>, <4, (9, 0, 2)>, <4, (9, 3, 2)>, <4, (0, 3, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Possible 3-stars: <6, (7, 2, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 6, 9, 5, 1} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - Possible 3-stars: <7, (4, 0, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 9)>, <7, (4, 0, 5)>, <7, (4, 0, 1)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 5)>, <7, (4, 6, 1)>, <7, (4, 9, 5)>, <7, (4, 9, 1)>, <7, (4, 5, 1)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 5)>, <7, (0, 6, 1)>, <7, (0, 9, 5)>, <7, (0, 9, 1)>, <7, (0, 5, 1)>, <7, (6, 9, 5)>, <7, (6, 9, 1)>, <7, (6, 5, 1)>, <7, (9, 5, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Possible 3-stars: <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 0)>, <8, (1, 9, 0)>, <8, (3, 9, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Possible 3-stars: <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
