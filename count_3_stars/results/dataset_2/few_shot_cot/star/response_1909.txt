Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Cannot form a 3-star)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Cannot form a 3-star)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 2, 10, 11} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 4, 7, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Cannot form a 3-star)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 14, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 13, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (Cannot form a 3-star)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 0
- From Node 4: 0
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 0
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 20 + 0 + 4 + 20 = 94

Therefore, there are a total of [94] 3-stars in your graph.
