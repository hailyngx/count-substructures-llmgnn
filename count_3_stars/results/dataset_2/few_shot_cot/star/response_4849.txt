Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 24, 17} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {21, 10} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 10
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
