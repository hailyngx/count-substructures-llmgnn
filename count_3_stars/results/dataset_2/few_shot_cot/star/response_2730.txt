Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 6, 2, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (1, 8, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (8, 6, 2)>, <0, (8, 2, 9)>, <0, (6, 2, 9)>
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 0)>, <1, (4, 9, 0)>, <1, (5, 9, 0)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5, 0, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (4, 7, 5)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 0, 9)>, <2, (7, 5, 0)>, 
             <2, (7, 5, 9)>, <2, (7, 0, 9)>, <2, (5, 0, 9)>, <2, (5, 0, 9)>, <2, (0, 9, 7)>
             
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (7, 1, 3)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 2)>, <5, (1, 8, 2)>, <5, (3, 8, 2)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (7, 3, 0)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (4, 9, 8)>, <7, (4, 2, 8)>, <7, (6, 9, 2)>,
            <7, (6, 9, 8)>, <7, (6, 2, 8)>, <7, (9, 2, 8)>, <7, (9, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 9, 8)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

  Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
  Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 39
  Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
