Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {26, 27, 17} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 25: 4
