Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node 
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node: 
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 11, 29} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {18, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars 
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4

- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 26: 10
- From Node 27: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 54
Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
