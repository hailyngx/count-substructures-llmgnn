Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 16, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 12, 15, 18} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 19, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 11, 15, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 18} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 18, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 16, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 15, 0, 16, 18} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
