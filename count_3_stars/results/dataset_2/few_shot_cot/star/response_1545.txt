Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 1, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 11, 14, 10, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 5, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 12, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 14, 7, 0, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 4, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 82
Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
