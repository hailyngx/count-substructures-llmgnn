Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 14} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {17, 19} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {16, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {19, 3, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 17, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)

- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 1, 0, 8, 12} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 15} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 15, 4, 7, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
