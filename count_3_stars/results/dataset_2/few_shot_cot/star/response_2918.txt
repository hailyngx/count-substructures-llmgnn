Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 17, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 9, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 14, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 8, 2, 13, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 0} (2 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
