Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  <2, (1, 8, 0)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\>
  <3, (5, 9, 4)>
  <3, (5, 4, 6)>
  <3, (9, 4, 1)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 1, 6, 3} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\>
  <4, (7, 8, 1)>
  <4, (7, 1, 2)>
  <4, (7, 1, 3)>
  <4, (8, 1, 3)>
  <4, (1, 6, 3)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\>

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\>
  <7, (5, 9, 4)>
  <7, (5, 4, 6)>
  <7, (9, 4, 1)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\>
  <8, (9, 4, 2)>
  <8, (4, 2, 6)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\>
  <9, (5, 8, 3)>
  <9, (5, 3, 7)>
  <9, (5, 7, 0)>
  <9, (8, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 3
- From Node 4: 5
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 3
- From Node 8: 2
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
