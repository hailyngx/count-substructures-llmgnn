Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 1, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5, 0} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 10
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 2: 10
        - From Node 3: 4
        - From Node 4: 10
        - From Node 5: 4
        - From Node 6: 4
        - From Node 7: 1
        - From Node 8: 4
        - From Node 9: 1
        
        Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 49
        Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
