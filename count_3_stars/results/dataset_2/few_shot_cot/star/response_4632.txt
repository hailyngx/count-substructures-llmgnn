Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 22: 1
