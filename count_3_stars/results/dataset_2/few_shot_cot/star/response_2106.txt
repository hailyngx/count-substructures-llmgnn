Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {18, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 19, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 19, 17, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 10, 14, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 16, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 18, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {18, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 17, 9} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 16, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
