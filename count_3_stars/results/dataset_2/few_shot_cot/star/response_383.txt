Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 11, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 22, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 28, 26, 7, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
