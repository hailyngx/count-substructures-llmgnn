Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors, following the same method as the example provided. 

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {20, 3, 14, 2, 24} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {29, 26} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {28, 0, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 21, 10, 27} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1

- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 20: 1
