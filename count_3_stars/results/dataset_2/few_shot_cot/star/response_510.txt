Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 17, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 19, 10, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2, 19, 16} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 15} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
