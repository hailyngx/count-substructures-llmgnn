Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {26, 8} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {22, 21, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47
Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
