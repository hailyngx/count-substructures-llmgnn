Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 10, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 14, 10, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 7, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 11, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 0, 6, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 10} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Isolated node.
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 85

Therefore, there are a total of [85] 3-stars in the given graph.
