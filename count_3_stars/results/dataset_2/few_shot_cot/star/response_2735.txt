Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we will follow the same step-by-step approach as before, counting the 3-stars formed around each node that has three or more neighbors.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {27, 20, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 25} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 10, 28} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {20, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {26, 25} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {26, 20, 6, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 24} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {29, 6, 22} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {19, 14, 25} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {26, 28, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {22, 16, 29} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 27**: Neighbors = {0, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {7, 24, 12, 16} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From the selected nodes: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4
Total number of 3-stars = 67

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in your graph.
