Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will determine the number of 3-star configurations for each node with three or more neighbors:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 16, 8, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {24, 2, 28} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 15, 21, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 15, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
