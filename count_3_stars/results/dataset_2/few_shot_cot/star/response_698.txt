Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {19, 6, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <0, (6, 10, 19)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <1, (6, 14, 17)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 19, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <2, (8, 11, 19)>, <2, (8, 11, 14)>, <2, (8, 19, 14)>, <2, (11, 19, 14)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {12, 8, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <3, (8, 12, 18)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <4, (7, 9, 15)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 12, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {16, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 15, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <7, (4, 5, 15)>

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <14, (1, 2, 13)>
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <15, (4, 7, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in your graph.
