Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 16, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 2, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}=1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 15, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}=1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}=4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 3, 6, 16} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}=4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {15, 19} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14, 1} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 19, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}=1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 18, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}=4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 0, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}=4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 10, 15} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}=4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}=1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {14, 12, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}=1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
