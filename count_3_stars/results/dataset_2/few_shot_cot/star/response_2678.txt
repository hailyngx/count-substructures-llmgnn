Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
