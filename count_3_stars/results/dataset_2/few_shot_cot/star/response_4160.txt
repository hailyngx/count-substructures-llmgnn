Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
