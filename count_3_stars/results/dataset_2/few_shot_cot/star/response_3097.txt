Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
    - 3-Star configurations: <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 1, 3)>, <0, (2, 1, 9)>, <0, (3, 1, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 9, 8)>, <0, (2, 1, 8)>, <0, (3, 9, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
    - 3-Star configurations: <1, (4, 7, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 0)>, <1, (4, 6, 0)>, <1, (7, 6, 0)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
    - 3-Star configurations: <3, (9, 4, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
    - 3-Star configurations: <4, (7, 1, 3)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)

    - 3-Star configurations: <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 2)>, <7, (5, 9, 1)>, <7, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (5, 4, 1)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <7, (9, 2, 1)>, <7, (4, 2, 1)>, <7, (9, 2, 4)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
    - 3-Star configurations: <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 7)>, <9, (8, 3, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (3, 7, 0)>
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 49
Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
