Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {22, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 16, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 28: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
