Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( ^4C_3 = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( ^4C_3 = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( ^4C_3 = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( ^4C_3 = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 0, 1, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( ^6C_3 = 20 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( ^4C_3 = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( ^4C_3 = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( ^4C_3 = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( ^4C_3 = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
  - From Node 0: 4
  - From Node 1: 4
  - From Node 2: 4
  - From Node 3: 4
  - From Node 4: 20
  - From Node 5: 4
  - From Node 6: 4
  - From Node 8: 4
  - From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
