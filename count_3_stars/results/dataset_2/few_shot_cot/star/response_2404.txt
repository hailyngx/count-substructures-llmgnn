Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 14, 10, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 14, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2, 8, 0, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 4, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 14, 10, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 8, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 0
- From Node 5: 0
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 0
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 0
- From Node 12: 0
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 20 + 0 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 10 = 102

Therefore, there are a total of [102] 3-stars in your graph.
