Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
