Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll evaluate each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - The 3-stars involving Node 2 are: 
    - <2, (4, 8, 7)>
    - <2, (4, 8, 0)>
    - <2, (4, 7, 0)>
    - <2, (8, 7, 0)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 2, 5, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - The 3-star involving Node 4 is: 
    - <4, (12, 5, 11)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 11, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 5, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - The 3-star involving Node 11 is: 
    - <11, (7, 13, 12)>

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 12, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 7, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in the graph.
