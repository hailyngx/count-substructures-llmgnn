Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 8, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (6, 8, 14)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 14, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 10, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 2, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 12, 13, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <8, (6, 0, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <11, (7, 12, 4)>
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 7, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <12, (10, 11, 13)>, <12, (7, 11, 13)>
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <13, (0, 12, 14)>, <13, (0, 7, 14)>
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 1, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <14, (0, 6, 9)>, <14, (1, 6, 9)>, <14, (0, 6, 13)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 64

Therefore, there are a total of [64] 3-stars in your graph.
