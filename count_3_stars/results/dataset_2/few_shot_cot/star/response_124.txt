Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll evaluate each node for the formation of 3-stars:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 6, 2, 1} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
