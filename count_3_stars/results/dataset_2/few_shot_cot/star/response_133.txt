Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
    
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 8, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 12, 2, 4} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 0, 4, 13} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
    
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 3, 6, 13, 14} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 3, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {10, 12, 2, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
    
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
  
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in your graph.
