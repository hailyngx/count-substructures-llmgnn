Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
From Node 0: 1
From Node 1: 4
From Node 2: 4
From Node 3: 1
From Node 4: 1
From Node 5: 1
From Node 6: 4
From Node 7: 1
From Node 8: 4
From Node 11: 4
From Node 12: 4
From Node 13: 1
From Node 15: 1
From Node 19: 1
From Node 20: 4
From Node 21: 1
From Node 22: 4
From Node 23: 4
From Node 24: 4
From Node 26: 1
From Node 27: 4
From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 48
