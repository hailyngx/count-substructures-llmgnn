Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 6, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 1, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 1, 10, 3, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 14, 2, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 12, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 3, 12, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 12, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 6, 11, 10} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
