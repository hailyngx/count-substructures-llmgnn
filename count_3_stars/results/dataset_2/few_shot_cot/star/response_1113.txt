Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 1, 2, 5, 13} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (12, 1, 2)>, <0, (12, 1, 5)>, <0, (12, 1, 13)>, <0, (12, 2, 5)>, <0, (12, 2, 13)>, <0, (12, 5, 13)>, <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 2, 13)>, <0, (1, 5, 13)>, <0, (2, 5, 13)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12, 6, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (12, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 9, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (12, 5, 9)>, <2, (12, 5, 3)>, <2, (12, 5, 0)>, <2, (12, 9, 3)>, <2, (12, 9, 0)>, <2, (12, 3, 0)>, <2, (5, 9, 3)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>, <2, (5, 3, 0)>, <2, (9, 3, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 14, 13, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <3, (4, 2, 14)>, <3, (4, 2, 13)>, <3, (4, 2, 9)>, <3, (4, 14, 13)>, <3, (4, 14, 9)>, <3, (4, 13, 9)>, <3, (2, 14, 13)>, <3, (2, 14, 9)>, <3, (2, 13, 9)>, <3, (14, 13, 9)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <5, (4, 7, 2)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 14, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <6, (7, 1, 14)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 12, 6, 14, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (10, 12, 6)>, <7, (10, 12, 14)>, <7, (10, 12, 5)>, <7, (10, 6, 14)>, <7, (10, 6, 5)>, <7, (10, 14, 5)>, <7, (12, 6, 14)>, <7, (12, 6, 5)>, <7, (12, 14, 5)>, <7, (6, 14, 5)>

    - 3-Stars: <9, (10, 1, 2)>
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 7, 13, 9} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
