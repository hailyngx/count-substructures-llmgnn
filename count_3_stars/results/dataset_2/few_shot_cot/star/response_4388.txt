Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 11, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 10, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 0, 7, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 12, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 10, 1, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 14, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 7, 2, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4, 7, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 87

Therefore, there are a total of [87] 3-stars in the graph.
