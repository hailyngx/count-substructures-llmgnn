Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 11, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 7, 5, 1, 10} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 2, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 14, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 11, 7, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10
Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
