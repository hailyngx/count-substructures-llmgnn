Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 4, 6, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 6, 19)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 10, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (8, 10, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 17, 1, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (14, 17, 1)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 15, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 10, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (4, 2, 10)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 12, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (14, 12, 19)>
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 5, 13, 15} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <10, (8, 2, 5)>, <10, (8, 2, 13)>, <10, (8, 2, 15)>, <10, (8, 5, 13)>, <10, (8, 5, 15)>, <10, (8, 13, 15)>, <10, (2, 5, 13)>, <10, (2, 5, 15)>, <10, (2, 13, 15)>, <10, (5, 13, 15)>
- **Node 11**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 16, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <12, (4, 6, 13)>, <12, (4, 6, 16)>, <12, (4, 9, 13)>, <12, (4, 9, 16)>, <12, (6, 9, 13)>, <12, (6, 9, 16)>, <12, (13, 6, 16)>, <12, (13, 9, 16)>, <12, (14, 9, 19)>, <12, (16, 6, 7)>
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 15, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {12, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <17, (14, 1, 6)>
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {1, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
