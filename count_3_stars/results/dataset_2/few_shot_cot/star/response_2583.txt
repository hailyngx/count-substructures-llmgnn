Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph, we'll determine the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each node that has three or more neighbors. If a node has exactly three neighbors, it can form exactly one 3-star. If a node has more than three neighbors, we will calculate the number of ways to choose 3 neighbors for the 3-star from its neighbors. If a node has less than three neighbors, it cannot form a 3-star.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node based on the given adjacency list:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 12, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 11, 10, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 4, 8, 13, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 0, 12, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 5, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 0, 9, 13, 6} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 9, 12, 6, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 102

Therefore, there are a total of [102] 3-stars in your graph.
