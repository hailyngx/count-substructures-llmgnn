Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 10
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 10
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
