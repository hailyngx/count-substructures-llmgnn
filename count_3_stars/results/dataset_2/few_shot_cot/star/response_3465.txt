Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
