Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 12, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 13, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 14, 1, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 2, 8, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 8, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 14, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 9, 1, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 78

Therefore, there are a total of [78] 3-stars in your graph.
