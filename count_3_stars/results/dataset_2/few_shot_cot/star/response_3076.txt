Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0)

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 8, 2, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
