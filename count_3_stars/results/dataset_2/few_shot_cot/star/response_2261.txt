Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (9, 4, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (6, 9, 4)>, <2, (6, 9, 8)>, <2, (6, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <2, (9, 4, 0)>, <2, (9, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <3, (7, 0, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <4, (9, 7, 5)>, <4, (9, 2, 5)>, <4, (7, 2, 5)>, <4, (7, 2, 1)>, <4, (7, 5, 1)>, <4, (2, 5, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-star: <5, (6, 4, 3)>, <5, (6, 4, 8)>, <5, (6, 3, 8)>, <5, (4, 3, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 7, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (9, 5, 2)>, <6, (9, 5, 8)>, <6, (9, 7, 2)>, <6, (9, 7, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (6, 4, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (6, 9, 1)>, <8, (6, 9, 5)>, <8, (6, 1, 5)>, <8, (6, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 1, 5)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 5, 2)>, <8, (1, 5, 2)>, <8, (1, 5, 0)>, <8, (5, 2, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 1)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
