Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node to determine the number of 3-star configurations:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 11, 15, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Counting all the valid 3-star configurations:

From Node 1: 4
From Node 2: 4
From Node 4: 1
From Node 5: 1
From Node 6: 1
From Node 7: 1
From Node 10: 1
From Node 12: 10
From Node 14: 4
From Node 15: 1
From Node 17: 10
From Node 18: 1
From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in the given graph.
