Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 12, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 14, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 12, 6, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 6, 0, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 5, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 14, 0, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 5, 9, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 2, 11, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in your graph.
