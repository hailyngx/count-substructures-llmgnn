Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (9, 3, 8)>, <1, (9, 2, 8)>, <1, (3, 2, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 2)>, <3, (6, 7, 2)>, <3, (1, 7, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3, 4, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <7, (5, 9, 2)>, <7, (5, 6, 3)>, <7, (5, 6, 4)>, <7, (5, 6, 2)>, <7, (5, 3, 4)>, <7, (5, 3, 2)>, <7, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 6, 3)>, <7, (9, 6, 4)>, <7, (9, 6, 2)>, <7, (9, 3, 4)>, <7, (9, 3, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (6, 3, 4)>, <7, (6, 3, 2)>, <7, (6, 4, 2)>, <7, (3, 4, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 1, 4, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 9, 1)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>, <8, (5, 9, 2)>, <8, (5, 6, 1)>, <8, (5, 6, 4)>, <8, (5, 6, 2)>, <8, (5, 1, 4)>, <8, (5, 1, 2)>, <8, (5, 4, 2)>, <8, (9, 6, 1)>, <8, (9, 6, 4)>, <8, (9, 6, 2)>, <8, (9, 1, 4)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (6, 1, 4)>, <8, (6, 1, 2)>, <8, (6, 4, 2)>, <8, (1, 4, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 1, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 0)>, <9, (5, 7, 0)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>, <9, (8, 1, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in your graph.
