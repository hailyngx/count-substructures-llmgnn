Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 4, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 6} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 0} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 10, 9, 1} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {16, 17, 1} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 18} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 7**: No neighbors
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 2, 19} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 1} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 18, 8, 17} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 14} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {18, 15, 13, 19} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 14} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 19, 5} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 19, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 17, 4, 14} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
        
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 1: 4
        - From Node 8: 4
        - From Node 10: 4
        - From Node 11: 10
        - From Node 16: 1
        - From Node 17: 4
        - From Node 18: 4
        - From Node 19: 10
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42
        
        Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
