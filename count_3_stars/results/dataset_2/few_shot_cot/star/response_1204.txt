Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {16, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 16, 17} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 16, 12} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 16, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 10, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 15, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 19, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 7, 10, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
