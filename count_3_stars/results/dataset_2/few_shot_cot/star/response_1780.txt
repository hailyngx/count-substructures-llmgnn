Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {19, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 6, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 16, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {19, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 15, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 11, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10, 17, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 19, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 18, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {17, 12, 16, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
