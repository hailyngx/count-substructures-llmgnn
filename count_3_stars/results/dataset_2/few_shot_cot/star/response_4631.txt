Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {18, 16, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
