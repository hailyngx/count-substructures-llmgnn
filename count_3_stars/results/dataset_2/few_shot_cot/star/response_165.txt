Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 0, 7, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 5, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 5, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
