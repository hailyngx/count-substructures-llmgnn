Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 11, 16, 7} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 7, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 4, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 1} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 19, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {5, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 13, 16} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
