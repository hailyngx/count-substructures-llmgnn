Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
