Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
