Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 2, 4, 5} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 13, 3, 4} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 0, 2, 5, 3} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 4, 14} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 14, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 5, 4} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 4, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 5} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in your graph.
