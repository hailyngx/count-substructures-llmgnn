Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5, 2, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 5, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 2, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
