Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 14, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 10, 2, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}=10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}=4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 7, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}=10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}=4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 14, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}=10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}=4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}=4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 8, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}=10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 68

Therefore, there are a total of [68] 3-stars in your graph.
