Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will follow the same approach as shown in the example. We will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 14} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 28, 4} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {26, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 1} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 29, 4, 14} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 16, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {21, 12} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {22, 1, 18} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 15, 23, 0} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 22, 23, 25} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {21, 10, 24, 1} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 6} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 26, 16, 27} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 25} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 19} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {24} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {21, 8, 25, 27} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {15, 27} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 20**: Neighbors = {26, 22} (2 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 21**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 18} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 22**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 20, 27} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 26**: Neighbors = {2, 28, 13, 23, 20} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 21: 1

- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 10
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 53
Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
