Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
