Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 3, 0, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <1, (5, 4, 3)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 2)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 3, 2)>, <1, (7, 3, 8)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <2, (5, 3, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, <3, (5, 2, 0)>, <3, (1, 2, 0)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 1, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (9, 4, 0)>, <8, (9, 7, 1)>, <8, (9, 7, 2)>, <8, (9, 7, 0)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 1, 0)>, <8, (9, 2, 0)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 7, 2)>, <8, (4, 7, 0)>, <8, (4, 1, 2)>, <8, (4, 1, 0)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <8, (7, 1, 2)>, <8, (7, 1, 0)>, <8, (7, 2, 0)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 4, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
