Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node as follows:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 20, 25, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {29, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 15, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 22, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
