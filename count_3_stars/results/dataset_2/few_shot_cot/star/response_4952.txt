  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 12, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 11, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 14, 8, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 11, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 2, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 9, 5, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 0, 5, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 5} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 85

Therefore, there are a total of [85] 3-stars in your graph.
