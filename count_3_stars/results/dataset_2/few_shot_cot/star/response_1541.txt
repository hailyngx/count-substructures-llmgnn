Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 11, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
