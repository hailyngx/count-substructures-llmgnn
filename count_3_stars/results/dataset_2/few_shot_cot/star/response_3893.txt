Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 11, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 17, 10)>, <1, (3, 17, 11)>, <1, (3, 10, 11)>, <1, (17, 10, 11)>

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (12, 17, 7)>, <2, (12, 17, 11)>, <2, (12, 7, 11)>, <2, (17, 7, 11)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 17, 4, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 4, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (9, 13, 14)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {5, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <17, (1, 3, 2)>, <17, (1, 3, 19)>, <17, (1, 2, 19)>, <17, (3, 2, 19)>

Summing up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
