Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {14, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 18, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (6, 8, 18)>, <5, (6, 1, 18)>, <5, (8, 1, 18)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
