Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 15, 17, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 1, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {16, 13, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 19, 14, 17, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {12, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {16, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 2, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 3, 5, 15} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
