Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (9, 6, 4)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <3, (6, 8, 7)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <4, (6, 8, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 3, 4, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <6, (5, 9, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 0)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 0)>, <6, (1, 4, 0)>, <6, (3, 4, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (9, 8, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (4, 2, 3)>, <8, (4, 2, 1)>, <8, (4, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 3, 1)>, <8, (4, 3, 7)>, <8, (4, 1, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 1)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 1, 7)>, <8, (3, 1, 7)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <9, (5, 6, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 2, 7)>, <9, (5, 2, 0)>, <9, (5, 7, 0)>, <9, (6, 2, 7)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (2, 7, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
