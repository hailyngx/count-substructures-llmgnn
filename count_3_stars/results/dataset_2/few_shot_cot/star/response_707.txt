Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 13, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 10, 11, 14, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 12, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 14, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 11, 14, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 1, 8, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 11, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 70

Therefore, there are a total of [70] 3-stars in your graph.
