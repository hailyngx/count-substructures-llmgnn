Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 15} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 17, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {6, 17, 15} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 19**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
