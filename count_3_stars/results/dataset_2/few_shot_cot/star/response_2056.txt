Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 6: 7
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 12: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 7 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in your graph.
