Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 8, 3, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 5, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 11, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 10, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 5, 14, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 0, 13, 2, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 3, 8, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 1 + 4 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
