Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 7, 6, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 4, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 11, 14, 3, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 13, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 11, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 67

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in your graph.
