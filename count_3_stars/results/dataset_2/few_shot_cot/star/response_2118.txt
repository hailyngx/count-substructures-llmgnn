Response:
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the provided graph by following the same method as described in the example:

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 11, 8, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 13, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 10, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 8, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 12, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 11, 10, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 11, 6, 14, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 68
Therefore, there are a total of [68] 3-stars in your graph.
