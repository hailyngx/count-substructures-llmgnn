Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {20, 22} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {21, 29, 20} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {27, 23, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
