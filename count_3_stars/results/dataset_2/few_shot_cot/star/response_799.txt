Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 9
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 9
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 9
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 9 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 9 + 4 + 9 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
