Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (0, 3, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <2, (9, 3, 7)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 0, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <3, (1, 0, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 5, 0, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <7, (6, 0, 2)>, <7, (6, 5, 2)>, <7, (9, 3, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <8, (9, 1, 3)>, <8, (9, 1, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 2, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 1, 7)>
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 2
- From Node 4: 0
- From Node 5: 0
- From Node 6: 0
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 2
- From Node 9: 2
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 13
Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
