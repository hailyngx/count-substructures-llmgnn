Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 4
