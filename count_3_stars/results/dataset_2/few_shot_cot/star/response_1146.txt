Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 37
