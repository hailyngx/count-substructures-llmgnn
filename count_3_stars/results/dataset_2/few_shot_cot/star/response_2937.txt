Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 18} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 19, 7} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 19, 13, 18} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 18, 15} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 14} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: No neighbors
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 15, 13} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 14, 13, 18} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 12, 3} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 18, 12} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 10} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 7, 15} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 12} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 14, 12, 3} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
From the calculations above:
- Total from nodes with 3 neighbors: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17
- Total from nodes with 4 or more neighbors: 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Total number of 3-stars = 17 + 24 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
