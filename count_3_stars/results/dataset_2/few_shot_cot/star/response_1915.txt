Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 14, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 13, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 17, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {16, 2, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 17, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 19} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {15, 13, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 17, 12, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 9, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {1, 18, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {17, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {16, 13, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {0, 15} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1 
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 31

Therefore, there are a total of [31] 3-stars in your graph.
