Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 0, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 6, 1, 3} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
