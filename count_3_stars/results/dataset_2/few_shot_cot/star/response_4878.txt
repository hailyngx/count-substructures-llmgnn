Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 10, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {17, 11, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 0} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 17, 4, 7, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 15} (2 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 5, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
