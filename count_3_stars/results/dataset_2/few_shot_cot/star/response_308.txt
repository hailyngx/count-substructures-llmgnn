Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 11} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 6, 14, 9} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)

- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {19, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 19, 16, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {15, 5, 12} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
