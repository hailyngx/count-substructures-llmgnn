Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 18, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 16} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
