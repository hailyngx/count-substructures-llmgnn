Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
