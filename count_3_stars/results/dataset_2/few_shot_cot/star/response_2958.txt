Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 1, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 3, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
