Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 2
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
