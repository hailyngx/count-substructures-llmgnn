Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 5, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <0, (6, 9, 5)>, <0, (6, 9, 8)>, <0, (6, 5, 8)>, <0, (9, 5, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <1, (6, 4, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <2, (6, 3, 7)>, <2, (6, 3, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <3, (7, 2, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 7, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <4, (9, 1, 3)>, <4, (9, 1, 7)>, <4, (9, 1, 5)>, <4, (9, 3, 7)>, <4, (9, 3, 5)>, <4, (9, 7, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (1, 7, 5)>, <4, (3, 7, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - 3-Stars: <5, (6, 4, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 1, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <7, (9, 3, 4)>, <7, (9, 3, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (3, 4, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-Stars: <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (9, 1, 0)>, <8, (9, 2, 0)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-Stars: <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 0)>, <9, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 7, 0)>, <9, (4, 7, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
