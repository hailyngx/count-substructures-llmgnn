Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph by following the step-by-step process described in the previous example:

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 28, 11, 9, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 26, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 1, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {22, 13, 1, 25} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {24, 23} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
