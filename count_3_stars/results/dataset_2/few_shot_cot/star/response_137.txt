Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 0, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 11} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 10, 0} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 14, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 11, 6, 12, 8} (6 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 10} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 8, 13} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
