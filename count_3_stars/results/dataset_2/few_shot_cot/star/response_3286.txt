Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4
