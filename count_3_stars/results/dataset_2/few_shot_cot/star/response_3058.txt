Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 2, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
