Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors. If a node has exactly 3 neighbors, there's only 1 3-star formed with that node. No 3-star is formed if a node has less than 3 neighbors.

Let's calculate the 3-stars for each node based on the provided adjacency list:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 14, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2, 8, 4, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 2, 5, 12, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 11, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 12, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 11, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2, 1, 10, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 97

Therefore, there are a total of [97] 3-stars in your graph.
