Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:

- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
