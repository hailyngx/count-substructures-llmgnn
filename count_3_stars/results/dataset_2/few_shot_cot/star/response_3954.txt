Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has at least three neighbors:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 19, 13, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 7, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {18, 13, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {19, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 16, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {15, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {18, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing up the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
