Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 7, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 6, 19, 14} (5 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
