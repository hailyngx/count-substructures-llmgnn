Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 13, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 10, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 14, 10, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 11, 6, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 3, 12, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 13, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 12, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 14, 3, 12, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 6, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 1, 4, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 99

Therefore, there are a total of [99] 3-stars in your graph.
