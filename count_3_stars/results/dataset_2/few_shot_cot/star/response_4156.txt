Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 19} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 0, 18, 12} (5 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
