Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 16, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 19, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 6} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 16, 11, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {9, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 8, 11} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
