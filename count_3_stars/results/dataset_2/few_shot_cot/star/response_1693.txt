Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {23, 3, 25} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {28, 17, 25} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
