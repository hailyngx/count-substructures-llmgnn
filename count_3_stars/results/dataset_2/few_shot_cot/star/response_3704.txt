Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 19, 17, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {15, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 14, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 14, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 4, 10, 18, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 7} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
