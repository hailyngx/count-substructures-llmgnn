Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 28} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any other nodes so cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {28, 11, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 21, 0, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {22, 12, 24, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {20, 6, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {20, 8, 5, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor) so cannot form a 3-star.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {28, 22, 29, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in the graph.
