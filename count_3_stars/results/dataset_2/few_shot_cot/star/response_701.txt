- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <5, (9, 6, 2)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <6, (5, 1, 4)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
