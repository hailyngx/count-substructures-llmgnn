Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph by following the same method as the example:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 16, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
