Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28: 1 * 19 = 19
- From Nodes 10, 16, 17, 20, 24, 25, 27: 4 * 7 = 28
- From Node 21: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 19 + 28 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
