Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2)

Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 8, 4, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 3, 1, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 20 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in your graph based on the provided adjacency list.
