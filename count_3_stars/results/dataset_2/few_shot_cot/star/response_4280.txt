Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 6, 2, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 12, 3, 13, 1} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 11, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 3, 14, 13, 2} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 14, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11, 4, 8, 12} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 112

Therefore, there are a total of [112] 3-stars in your graph.
