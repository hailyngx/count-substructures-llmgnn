Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <1, (6, 3, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (3, 7, 4)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (0, 4, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <4, (3, 0, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <5, (2, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 8, 4, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <6, (1, 7, 9)> <6, (1, 4, 0)> <6, (1, 8, 0)> <6, (7, 8, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - <8, (1, 0, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <9, (1, 6, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in your graph.
