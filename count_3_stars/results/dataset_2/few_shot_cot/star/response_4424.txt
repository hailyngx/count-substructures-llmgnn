Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 5, 7, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16, 2, 19} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 19, 0, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
