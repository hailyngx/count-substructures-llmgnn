Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 19, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 16, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 9, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {17, 1, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 5, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 4, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {15, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 18, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {11, 19, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {10, 19, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {5, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 15, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 32

Therefore, there are a total of [32] 3-stars in your graph.
