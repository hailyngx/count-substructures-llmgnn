Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 0, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
