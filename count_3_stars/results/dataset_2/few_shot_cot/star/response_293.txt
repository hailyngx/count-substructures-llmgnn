Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 14, 16, 11, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 0, 16} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 10, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 10, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 5, 16} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 11, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 12, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 3, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 3} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 18, 15} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 15} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {12, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {12, 19} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 18, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 48

Therefore, there are a total of [48] 3-stars in your graph.
