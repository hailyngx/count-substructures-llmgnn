Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node: 

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 2, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <1, (3, 2, 10)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <2, (9, 1, 10)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <3, (1, 7, 8)>
  - <3, (1, 5, 8)>
  - <3, (7, 5, 8)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <4, (6, 9, 7)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 7, 3, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 12, 0, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - <7, (3, 4, 0)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 4, 10, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <8, (3, 4, 0)>
  - <8, (3, 4, 10)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <9, (6, 4, 0)>
  - <9, (6, 4, 2)>

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 11, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - <10, (1, 8, 2)>

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 5, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - <13, (9, 5, 14)>

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {13, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 3
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 2
- From Node 9: 2
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
