Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 2, 0, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 6, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 4, 12, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 14, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14, 11, 6, 10, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 0, 14, 12, 10, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 4, 5, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 9, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 79

Therefore, there are a total of [79] 3-stars in your graph.
