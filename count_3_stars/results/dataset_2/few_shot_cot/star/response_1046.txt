Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 2, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 8, 0, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
