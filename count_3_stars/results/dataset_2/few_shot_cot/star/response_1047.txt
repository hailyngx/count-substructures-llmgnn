Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
