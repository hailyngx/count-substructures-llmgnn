Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 5, 10, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {16, 1, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 10, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 10, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 18, 5, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {19} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 0, 5, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 19, 15} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
