Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 14, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 5, 0, 2, 13} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 12, 1, 13} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 0, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 14, 10, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 11, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 14, 8, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 11, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 11, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 105

Therefore, there are a total of [105] 3-stars in your graph.
