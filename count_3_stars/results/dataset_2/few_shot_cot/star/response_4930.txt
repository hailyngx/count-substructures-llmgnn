Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 16, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 14, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 17, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 12} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {12, 18, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
