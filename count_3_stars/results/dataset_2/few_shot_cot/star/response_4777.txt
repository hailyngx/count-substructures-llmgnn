Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 23: 10
