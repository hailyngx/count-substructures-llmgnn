Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 3, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 13, 6, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 9, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 5, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 11, 10, 2, 5} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 1, 6, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 9, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 2, 9, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in your graph.
