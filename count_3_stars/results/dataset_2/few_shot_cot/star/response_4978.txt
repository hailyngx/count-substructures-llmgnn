Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-star configurations:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 14, 11} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 13, 12, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 11, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 6, 14, 13} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 10, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 69

Therefore, there are a total of [69] 3-stars in your graph.
