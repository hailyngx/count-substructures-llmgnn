Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 2, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 4, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {12, 16, 11, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 19, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 19, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 10, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 19, 4, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {18, 2, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {15, 14, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {15, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
