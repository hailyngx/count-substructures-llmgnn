Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 26} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {29, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 25} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 19, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 17, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
