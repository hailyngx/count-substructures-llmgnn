Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- Node 0: Neighbors = {1} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 1: Neighbors = {3, 2, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 2: Neighbors = {7, 1, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 3: Neighbors = {4, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 4: Neighbors = {19, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 5: Neighbors = {10, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Neighbors = {9, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 7: Neighbors = {10, 2, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 8: Neighbors = {11, 13, 14, 16, 15} (5 neighbors)

- Node 11: Neighbors = {8, 12, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 12: Neighbors = {10, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 13: Neighbors = {7, 1, 10, 8, 12} (5 neighbors)

- Node 18: Neighbors = {15, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 19: Neighbors = {4, 2, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1
Total number of 3-stars = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
