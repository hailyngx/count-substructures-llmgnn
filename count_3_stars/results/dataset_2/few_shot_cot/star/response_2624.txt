Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph by examining each node that has at least three neighbors. Here's the calculation for each eligible node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 8, 13, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 13, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 7, 2, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 19, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 15, 10, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 16, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

The nodes that do not have at least three neighbors cannot form any 3-stars.

Summing up the total valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
