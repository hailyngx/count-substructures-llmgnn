Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 3, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 14, 12, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 13, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 8, 13, 0, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 13, 5, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 11, 14, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {12, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 0, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 5, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 83

Therefore, there are a total of [83] 3-stars in your graph.
