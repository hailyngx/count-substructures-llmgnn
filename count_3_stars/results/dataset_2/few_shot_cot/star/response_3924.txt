Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 19, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - <1, (11, 19, 8)>

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
