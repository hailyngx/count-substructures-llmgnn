Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 16, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (4, 16, 19)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 19, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
