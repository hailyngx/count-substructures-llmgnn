Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
