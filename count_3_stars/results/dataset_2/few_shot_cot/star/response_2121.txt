Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll now compute the number of 3-stars for each node that can form such structures. We'll only consider nodes with at least 3 neighbors, as per the definition of a 3-star.

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (12, 11, 9)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 4, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 10, 4)>, <1, (3, 7, 4)>, <1, (3, 4, 13)>, <1, (3, 8, 7)>, <1, (4, 8, 7)>, <1, (4, 13, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 14)>, <1, (8, 13, 12)>, <1, (8, 11, 12)>, <1, (8, 14, 7)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 10, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 10, 6)>, <3, (1, 7, 6)>, <3, (1, 10, 7)>, <3, (10, 7, 6)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 12, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 13, 9)>, <4, (1, 13, 12)>, <4, (1, 9, 7)>, <4, (9, 12, 13)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 11, 14, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 11, 14)>, <7, (1, 3, 11)>, <7, (1, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 11)>, <7, (3, 11, 9)>, <7, (11, 14, 8)>, <7, (11, 8, 9)>, <7, (14, 2, 8)>, <7, (9, 11, 4)>

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 5, 14, 11, 12} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 13, 12)>, <8, (1, 5, 14)>, <8, (1, 14, 7)>, <8, (1, 11, 12)>, <8, (13, 11, 12)>, <8, (13, 14, 12)>, <8, (5, 12, 13)>, <8, (5, 12, 4)>, <8, (5, 12, 10)>, <8, (5, 4, 12)>, <8, (5, 10, 12)>, <8, (14, 11, 8)>, <8, (14, 7, 9)>, <8, (11, 13, 12)>, <8, (11, 6, 3)>, <8, (11, 7, 9)>, <8, (11, 0, 12)>, <8, (11, 9, 4)>, <8, (12, 13, 6)>, <8, (12, 10, 4)>

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (4, 11, 0)>, <9, (4, 7, 11)>, <9, (4, 10, 1)>, <9, (4, 10, 12)>, <9, (7, 4, 13)>, <9, (7, 11, 0)>, <9, (0, 12, 11)>, <9, (0, 11, 10)>, <9, (11, 12, 8)>, <9, (11, 4, 12)>

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 5, 4, 10, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <12, (8, 5, 13)>, <12, (8, 5, 4)>, <12, (8, 5, 10)>, <12, (8, 5, 12)>, <12, (8, 4, 13)>, <12, (8, 4, 5)>, <12, (8, 10, 4)>, <12, (8, 10, 12)>, <12, (8, 10, 0)>, <12, (8, 12, 0)>, <12, (5, 4, 10)>, <12, (5, 10, 13)>, <12, (5, 4, 13)>, <12, (5, 4, 12)>, <12, (5, 4, 0)>, <12, (10, 13, 6)>, <12, (10, 0, 11)>, <12, (10, 9, 4)>, <12, (13, 6, 3)>, <12, (13, 6, 4)>

Summing up all the valid configurations, we have:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 12: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 20 = 79

Therefore, there are a total of [79] 3-stars in the given graph.
