Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 7, 12, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 96

Therefore, there are a total of [96] 3-stars in your graph.
