Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {18, 13, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 16, 14, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <3, (7, 14, 16)>, <3, (7, 2, 16)>, <3, (14, 2, 16)>, <3, (7, 14, 2)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (11, 7, 17)>, <6, (11, 4, 17)>, <6, (7, 4, 17)>, <6, (11, 7, 4)>

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {18, 1, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
