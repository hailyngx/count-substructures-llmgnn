Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
