Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 19}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 10}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 12, 6}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 16, 13, 2}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {18, 12, 16}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 11}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {14}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 10}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 11, 10}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 1, 8}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 6}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 2, 11}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 10}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 7, 2}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 12}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 18, 19}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {1, 9}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 19, 16}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 16}
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
