Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2)

Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
