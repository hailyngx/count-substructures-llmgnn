Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 19, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {18, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 9, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 5, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 5, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {15, 5, 18, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
