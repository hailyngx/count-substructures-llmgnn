Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 4
