Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 14, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 13, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 8, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 18, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 19, 12, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 18, 5, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 9, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {18, 5, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {2, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {1, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 9, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 4, 7, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 17, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 37
Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
