Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 43
