Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 19, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 19, 8, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 16, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 0, 17} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
