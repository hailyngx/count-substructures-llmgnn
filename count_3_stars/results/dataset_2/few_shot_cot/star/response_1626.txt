Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 7, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 13, 4, 9, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 10, 14, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 6, 2, 11, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 9, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 12, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 5, 0, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 2, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 83

Therefore, there are a total of [83] 3-stars in your graph.
