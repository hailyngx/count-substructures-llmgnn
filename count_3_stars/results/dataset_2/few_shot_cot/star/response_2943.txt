Response:
Calculation of 3- Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {28, 29, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 3, 19, 9, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
