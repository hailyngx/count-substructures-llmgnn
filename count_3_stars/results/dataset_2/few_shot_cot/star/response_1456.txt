Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2, 3, 1, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 7, 12, 0, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 0, 9, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 5, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 0, 2, 8, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 8, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 6, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 2, 14, 1, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 3, 13, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 94

Therefore, there are a total of [94] 3-stars in your graph.
