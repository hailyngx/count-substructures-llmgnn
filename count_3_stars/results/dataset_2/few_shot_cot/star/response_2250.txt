Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 10
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 58
