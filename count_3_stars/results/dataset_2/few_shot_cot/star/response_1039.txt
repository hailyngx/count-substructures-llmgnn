Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node to determine the number of 3-star configurations:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 4, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {25, 19, 16, 21} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4+ 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 55
