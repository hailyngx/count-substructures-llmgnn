Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
