Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (Only 1 3-star can be formed)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 11, 14, 12, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 20
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 13, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 10, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 10, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 6, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 12, 2, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 10
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 12, 6, 10} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 20

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 91

Therefore, there are a total of [91] 3-stars in your graph.
