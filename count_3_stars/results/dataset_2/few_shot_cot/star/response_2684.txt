Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {18, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 10, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {19, 17, 12, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {12, 11, 16, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {18, 5, 0, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 15} (2 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2, 12, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 3, 10, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 15, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {2, 18, 7, 8, 14} (5 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in the graph.
