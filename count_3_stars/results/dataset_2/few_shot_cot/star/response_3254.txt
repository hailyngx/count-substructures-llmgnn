Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 14, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 11, 12, 7} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 11, 7, 2, 4} (6 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 12, 10} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 0, 10} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 13, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13} (1 neighbor)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 10, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 14, 6, 4} (5 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
	- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 10} (3 neighbors)
	- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 92

Therefore, there are a total of [92] 3-stars in your graph.
