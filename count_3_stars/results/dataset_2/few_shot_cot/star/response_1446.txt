Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (5, 6, 2)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (5, 2, 7)>, <0, (6, 2, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (9, 2, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 3, 0)>, <2, (1, 4, 0)>, <2, (3, 4, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 4, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (9, 7, 4)>, <3, (9, 7, 2)>, <3, (9, 4, 2)>, <3, (7, 4, 2)>, <3, (9, 4, 8)>, <3, (7, 4, 8)>, <3, (7, 2, 8)>, <3, (4, 2, 8)>, <3, (9, 2, 8)>, <3, (4, 2, 8)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <4, (9, 1, 3)>, <4, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (9, 3, 2)>, <4, (1, 3, 2)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-Stars: <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 6, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (5, 9, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>, <7, (5, 3, 8)>, <7, (9, 3, 8)>, <7, (5, 3, 0)>, <7, (9, 3, 0)>, <7, (9, 8, 0)>, <7, (3, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (3, 8, 0)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 3, 1, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 1)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (3, 1, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 4  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 2: 4  
- From Node 3: 10  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 5: 4  
- From Node 6: 1  
- From Node 7: 10  
- From Node 9: 20  
  
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 = 58  
  
Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
