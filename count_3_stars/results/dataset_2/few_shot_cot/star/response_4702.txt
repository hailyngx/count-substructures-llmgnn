Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {25, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12, 6, 15, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <1, (12, 6, 15)>, <1, (12, 6, 5)>, <1, (12, 15, 5)>, <1, (6, 15, 5)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 27, 22} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <3, (11, 27, 22)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 16, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <4, (5, 16, 19)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {14, 22, 1, 13, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <5, (14, 22, 1)>, <5, (14, 22, 13)>, <5, (14, 22, 4)>, <5, (14, 1, 13)>, <5, (14, 1, 4)>, <5, (14, 13, 4)>, <5, (22, 1, 13)>, <5, (22, 1, 4)>, <5, (22, 13, 4)>, <5, (1, 13, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {29, 1, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Possible 3-star: <6, (29, 1, 18)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 19, 23, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Possible 3-stars: <7, (12, 19, 23)>, <7, (12, 19, 18)>, <7, (12, 23, 18)>, <7, (19, 23, 18)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
