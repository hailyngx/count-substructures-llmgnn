Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1)

Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 3, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 9, 2, 5, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 5, 0, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
