Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 6, 3, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 13, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 12, 6, 11, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 3, 11, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 14, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {2, 11, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 78

Therefore, there are a total of [78] 3-stars in the given graph.
