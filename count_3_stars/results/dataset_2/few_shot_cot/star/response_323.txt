Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 21, 29} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - No unique 3-stars can be formed as node 0 has exactly 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 18, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - No unique 3-stars can be formed as node 2 has exactly 3 neighbors.

...

- **Node 28**: Neighbors = {7, 25} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {0, 5, 18, 25} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars:
    - <29, (0, 18, 25)>
    - <29, (0, 5, 25)>
    - <29, (5, 18, 25)>
    - <29, (0, 5, 18)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 0) + 1 (from Node 2) + 4 (from Node 29) = 6

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in your graph.
