Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 67
