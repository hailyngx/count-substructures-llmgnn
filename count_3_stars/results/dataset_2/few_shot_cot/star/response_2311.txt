Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, let's analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {18, 17} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 16, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 8, 11)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 11} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 16, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <8, (7, 2, 5)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 19, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 6, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 17} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 14} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <13, (15, 19, 14)>
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {15, 13, 16, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 13, 14, 17, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {15, 12, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {1, 0} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <19, (4, 13, 10)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
