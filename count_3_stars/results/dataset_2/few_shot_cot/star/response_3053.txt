Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1)

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 1, 6, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 9, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 5, 6, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 6, 8, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0, 2, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
