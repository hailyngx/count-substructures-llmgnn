Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 20: 4
