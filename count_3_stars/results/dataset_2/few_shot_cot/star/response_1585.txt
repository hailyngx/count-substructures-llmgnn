Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
