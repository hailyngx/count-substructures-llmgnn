Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 5, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (3, 0, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <2, (6, 1, 3)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 2, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (9, 1, 7)>
  - <3, (9, 1, 2)>
  - <3, (9, 7, 2)>
  - <3, (9, 7, 4)>
  - <3, (1, 7, 2)>
  - <3, (1, 7, 4)>
  - <3, (7, 2, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 0, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <4, (6, 9, 3)>
  - <4, (6, 9, 5)>
  - <4, (3, 0, 5)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <5, (6, 4, 8)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <6, (5, 2, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (9, 1, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1 configuration
- From Node 1: 1 configuration
- From Node 2: 1 configuration
- From Node 3: 7 configurations
- From Node 4: 3 configurations
- From Node 5: 1 configuration
- From Node 6: 1 configuration
- From Node 7: 1 configuration

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in your graph.
