Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the provided graph, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(^{3}C_{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 7, 3, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(^{6}C_{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(^{3}C_{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(^{4}C_{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(^{4}C_{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(^{3}C_{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 2, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(^{5}C_{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(^{5}C_{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(^{5}C_{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
