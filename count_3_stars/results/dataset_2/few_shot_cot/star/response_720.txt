Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 10, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {17, 19, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {16, 19, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 15} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 18, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 19, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 1, 0, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 15, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 12, 15} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {16, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 6, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 14, 5} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
