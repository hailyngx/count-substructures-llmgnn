Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 7, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Not connected to any other nodes. No 3-star is formed.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 17, 7, 19, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {15, 10, 8, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 17, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 18, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {2, 13, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 19, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {18, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 18} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {17, 4, 19, 11, 16} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 15, 18, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 51

Therefore, there are a total of [51] 3-stars in your graph.
