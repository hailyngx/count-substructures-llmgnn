Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
