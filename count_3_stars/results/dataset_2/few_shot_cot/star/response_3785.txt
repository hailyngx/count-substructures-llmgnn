Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
