Calculating the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- Total from Nodes 0-5: 5
- Total from Nodes 6-10: 8
- Total from Nodes 12-15: 13
- Total from Nodes 17-20: 19
- Total from Nodes 21-25: 10
- Total from Nodes 27 and 28: 4
Summing up all the configurations: 5 + 8 + 13 + 19 + 10 + 4 = 59

Therefore, there are a total of [59] 3-stars in your graph.
