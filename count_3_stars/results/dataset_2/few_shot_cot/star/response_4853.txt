Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 6, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 1, 6, 10, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 11, 10, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 13, 1, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 11, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 79

Therefore, there are a total of [79] 3-stars in your graph. This count represents how many unique 3-star subgraphs can be formed based on the adjacency list provided.
