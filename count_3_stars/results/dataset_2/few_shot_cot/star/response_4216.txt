Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 12, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 13, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 13, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {15, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2, 18, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {18, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 16, 11, 1} (5 neighbors)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {17, 8, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 19, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {17, 12, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 16, 12, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 11, 6} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
