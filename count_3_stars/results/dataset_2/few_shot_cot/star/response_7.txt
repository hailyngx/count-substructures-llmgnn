Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1, formed with leaves (5, 14, 2) 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 7, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1, formed with leaves (17, 7, 16)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 19, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4, formed with leaves (5, 0, 19), (5, 0, 15), (5, 19, 15), and (0, 19, 15)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1, formed with leaves (9, 17, 18)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1, formed with leaves (9, 8, 16)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 17, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10, formed with leaves (9, 2, 17), (9, 2, 0), (9, 2, 14), (9, 17, 0), (9, 17, 14), (9, 0, 14), (2, 17, 0), (2, 17, 14), (2, 0, 14), and (17, 0, 14)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1, formed with leaves (9, 10, 8)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 4, 19, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10, formed with leaves (6, 13, 4), (6, 13, 19), (6, 13, 18), (6, 4, 19), (6, 4, 18), (6, 19, 18), (13, 4, 19), (13, 4, 18), (13, 19, 18), and (4, 19, 18)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 7} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1, formed with leaves (4, 1, 19)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1, formed with leaves (9, 8, 3)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1, formed with leaves (8, 2, 16)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
