  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\>

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
