Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 9, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 14, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbor = {13} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {16, 18, 11, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 10, 9, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 15, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {17, 5, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 18, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 15**: Neighbor = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {12, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {13, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {14, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 11, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
