Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 10
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
