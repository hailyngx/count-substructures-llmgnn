Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 8, 5, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 4, 8, 13, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 12, 5, 14, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 14, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 14, 0, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 0, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 8, 2, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 95

Therefore, there are a total of [95] 3-stars in your graph.
