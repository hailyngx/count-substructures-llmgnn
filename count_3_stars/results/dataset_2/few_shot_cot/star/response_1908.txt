Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 14, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 7, 5, 4} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 12, 0, 5, 14} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 2, 14, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 12, 8, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 5, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 4, 2, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 6, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 6, 13} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in your graph.
