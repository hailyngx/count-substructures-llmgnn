Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 89

Therefore, there are a total of [89] 3-stars in your graph.
