Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8

Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 2, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 65

Therefore, there are a total of [65] 3-stars in your graph.
