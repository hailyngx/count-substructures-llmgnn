Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 8, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 0, 2, 5}(6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
