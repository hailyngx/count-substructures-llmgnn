Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (9, 3, 4)>, <0, (9, 3, 2)>, <0, (9, 4, 2)>, <0, (3, 4, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <1, (6, 3, 2)>, <1, (6, 3, 4)>, <1, (6, 2, 4)>, <1, (3, 2, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (5, 1, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (5, 9, 1)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (5, 9, 0)>, <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 0)>, <3, (5, 1, 7)>, <3, (5, 1, 0)>, <3, (5, 7, 0)>, <3, (9, 6, 1)>, <3, (9, 6, 7)>, <3, (9, 6, 0)>, <3, (9, 1, 7)>, <3, (9, 1, 0)>, <3, (9, 7, 0)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 0)>, <3, (6, 7, 0)>, <3, (1, 7, 0)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 8, 3)>, <5, (2, 8, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (8, 3, 7)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <7, (5, 3, 4)>, <7, (5, 3, 8)>, <7, (5, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
