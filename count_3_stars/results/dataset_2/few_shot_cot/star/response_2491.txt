Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 13, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 11, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 11, 10, 13} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 13, 2, 0, 12} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 3, 10, 11} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 2, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 11} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 86

Therefore, there are a total of [86] 3-stars in the given graph.
