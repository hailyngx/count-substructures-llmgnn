Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 8, 5, 13} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 14, 10, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 11, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 8, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 2, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 13, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
