Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
