Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 10
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 60

Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
