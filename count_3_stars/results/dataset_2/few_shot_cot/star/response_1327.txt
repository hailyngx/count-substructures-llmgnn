Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <0, (1, 4, 6)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8, 0, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <6, (0, 1, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <9, (4, 6, 8)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
  
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
