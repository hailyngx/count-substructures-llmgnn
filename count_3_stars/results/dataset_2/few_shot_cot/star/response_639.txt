Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {27, 28, 15, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (27, 28, 15)>, <0, (27, 28, 5)>, <0, (27, 15, 5)>, <0, (28, 15, 5)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {27, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (27, 13, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 16, 28, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (19, 16, 28)>, <4, (19, 16, 6)>, <4, (19, 28, 6)>, <4, (16, 28, 6)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 18, 28, 24} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 18, 28)>, <5, (0, 18, 24)>, <5, (0, 28, 24)>, <5, (18, 28, 24)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 28, 14, 18} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <8, (1, 13, 28)>, <8, (1, 13, 14)>, <8, (1, 13, 18)>, <8, (1, 28, 14)>, <8, (1, 28, 18)>, <8, (1, 14, 18)>, <8, (13, 28, 14)>, <8, (13, 28, 18)>, <8, (13, 14, 18)>, <8, (28, 14, 18)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {23, 24} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {25, 20, 23, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <10, (25, 20, 23)>, <10, (25, 20, 14)>, <10, (25, 23, 14)>, <10, (20, 23, 14)>
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {29, 26, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <11, (29, 26, 15)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 28

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
