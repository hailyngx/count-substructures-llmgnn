Response:
A 3-star graph consists of a central node, called the center, which is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {19, 10, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <0, (19, 10, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 3, 13, 17} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
