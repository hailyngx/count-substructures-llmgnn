Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 11, 14, 10} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 0, 10, 3, 14} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 10, 11, 6} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 12, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 3, 11, 8} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 11, 13, 1} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 13, 2, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 6, 9, 12, 1} (6 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2, 5, 11} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
  Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 112

Therefore, there are a total of [112] 3-stars in your graph.
