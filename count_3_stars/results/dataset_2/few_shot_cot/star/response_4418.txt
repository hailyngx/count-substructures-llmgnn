Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 16, 10} (4 neighbors)  
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)  
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 17, 11} (4 neighbors)  
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 14} (3 neighbors)  
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {6} (1 neighbor)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in your graph.
