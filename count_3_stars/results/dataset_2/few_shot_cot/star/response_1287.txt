Response:
From the given adjacency list, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {26, 13, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1

- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
