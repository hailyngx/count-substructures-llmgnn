Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
