Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 10, 6, 12, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 10
- Node 5: 10
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 20
- Node 10: 10
- Node 12: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
