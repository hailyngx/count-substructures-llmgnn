Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 14, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 12, 5, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 13, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 12, 2, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 0, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 8, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 7, 4, 13, 5} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 14, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in your graph.
