Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {27, 7, 10, 4, 29} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 63

Therefore, there are a total of [63] 3-stars in your graph.
