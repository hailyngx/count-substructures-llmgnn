Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {17, 18, 9, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {16, 12, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 7, 12, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 15, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {14, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {15, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 12, 18, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {2, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 5, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 14, 6, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {1, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
