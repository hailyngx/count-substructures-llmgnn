Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 6, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
