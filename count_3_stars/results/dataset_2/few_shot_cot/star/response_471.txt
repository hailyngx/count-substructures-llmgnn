Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {23, 19, 10, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 27, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
