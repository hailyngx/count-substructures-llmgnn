Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 6
- From Node 3: 3
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 6
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 6 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 29

Therefore, there are a total of [29] 3-stars in your graph.
