Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 14, 7, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 2, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 13, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 11, 3, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 7, 8, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 3, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 7, 12, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 72

Therefore, there are a total of [72] 3-stars in this graph.
