Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 26: 4
