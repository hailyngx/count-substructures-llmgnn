Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 9, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 10, 4, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 14, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9, 11, 14} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 12, 10} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 4} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 11, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 12, 4, 10, 0} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 8, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 2, 7, 0, 13, 4} (6 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 7, 9} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 8, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
