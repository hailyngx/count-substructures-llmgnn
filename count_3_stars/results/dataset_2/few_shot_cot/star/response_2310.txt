Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 1, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 17, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 12, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 14, 18, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
