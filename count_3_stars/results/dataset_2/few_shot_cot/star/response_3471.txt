Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 12, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 7, 6, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 9, 5, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {10, 11, 4, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 11, 0, 1, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 14, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 9, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 5, 6, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
