Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 2, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: No neighbors
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 5} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 8, 13, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 10} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 13, 2, 19, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 16, 11} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 19, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {17, 13, 4, 15} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 3, 15} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 43
Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
