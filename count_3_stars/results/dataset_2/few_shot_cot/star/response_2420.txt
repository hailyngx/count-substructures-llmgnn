Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 8, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 19, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 4, 6, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 13, 0, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 9, 4, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 9, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 14**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {18, 7, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {9, 19, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {17, 13, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are a total of [44] 3-stars in your graph.
