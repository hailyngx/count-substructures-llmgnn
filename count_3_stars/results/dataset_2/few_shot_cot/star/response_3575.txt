Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 12, 19, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {16, 12} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 3, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 5, 19} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 10, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {13, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {16, 14, 5, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 0, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 6, 15} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 14, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 1, 2, 4, 15} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
