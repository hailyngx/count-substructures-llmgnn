Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {22, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 11)>, <1, (3, 9, 11)>, <1, (5, 9, 11)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 28, 9, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 9, 17)>, <2, (3, 9, 28)>, <2, (3, 17, 28)>, <2, (9, 17, 28)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 10)>, <3, (1, 8, 10)>, <3, (2, 8, 10)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {18, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 19, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 19, 24)>
- Continue this process for the remaining nodes...

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- Add up the results for other nodes with 3 or more neighbors.

Calculations for all nodes have to be completed to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Let's calculate it now.
