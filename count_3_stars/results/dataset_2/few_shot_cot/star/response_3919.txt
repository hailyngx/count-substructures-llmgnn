Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 18: 10
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 10
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
