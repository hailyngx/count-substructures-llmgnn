Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 19} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
    - 3-Star: <0, (4, 10, 19)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 8} (3 neighbors)

    - 3-Star: <1, (6, 13, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 41

Therefore, there are a total of [41] 3-stars in your graph.
