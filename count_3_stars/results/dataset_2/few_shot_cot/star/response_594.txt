Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 12, 2, 0, 14, 9} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 101

Therefore, there are a total of [101] 3-stars in your graph.
