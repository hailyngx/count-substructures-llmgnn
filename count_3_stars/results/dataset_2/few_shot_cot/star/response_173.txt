Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 17} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 16} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 19} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 17, 10, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 12, 2, 10} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {19, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {16, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4, 18, 19} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 19, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {7, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 10, 17} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 2, 10} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
