Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 9, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 2, 14, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <1, (7, 10, 14)>, <1, (7, 10, 2)>, <1, (7, 10, 12)>, <1, (7, 2, 14)>, <1, (7, 2, 12)>, <1, (7, 14, 2)>, <1, (10, 2, 14)>, <1, (10, 2, 12)>, <1, (10, 14, 12)>, <1, (2, 14, 12)>

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 13, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 11, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 11, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 13, 5, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 5, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 5, 12, 2, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
