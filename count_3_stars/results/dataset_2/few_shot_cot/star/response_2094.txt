Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 8, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
