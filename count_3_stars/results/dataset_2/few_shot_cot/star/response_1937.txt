Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 7, 11, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 1, 10} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 10, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 8, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 13, 7} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 14, 3} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 2, 10, 11} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 10, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 80

Therefore, there are a total of [80] 3-stars in your graph.
