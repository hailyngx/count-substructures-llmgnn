Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each applicable node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 8, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 12, 10, 15} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {18, 8, 12, 11} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {16} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 14, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 9, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {4, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 19, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {18, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {2, 17, 9, 10, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {18, 16, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 17, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 57

Therefore, there are a total of [57] 3-stars in your graph.
