Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 5, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 9, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 9, 0, 1, 3} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
