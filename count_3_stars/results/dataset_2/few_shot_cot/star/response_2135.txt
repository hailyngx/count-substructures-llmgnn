Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7)

Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 5, 6, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 2, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 2, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 5, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 9, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 20
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 62

Therefore, there are a total of [62] 3-stars in your graph.
