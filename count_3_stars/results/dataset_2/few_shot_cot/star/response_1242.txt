Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 11, 9} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 11, 14, 10, 9} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 9, 11, 6} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 11, 3, 14} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 13, 3, 11} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 10, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 6} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 0, 3, 1, 10} (6 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 1, 9} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 0, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 5, 10, 14, 9} (5 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 6} (2 neighbors)  
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 20
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 92

Therefore, there are a total of [92] 3-stars in your graph.
