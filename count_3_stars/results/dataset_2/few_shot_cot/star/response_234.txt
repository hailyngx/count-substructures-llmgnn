Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <0, (5, 9, 4)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <1, (9, 3, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 7, 8, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 4)>, 
    <3, (6, 7, 4)>, <3, (1, 7, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <4, (1, 3, 7)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 0)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 2, 0)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, 
    <5, (9, 0, 3)>, <5, (6, 2, 0)>, <5, (6, 2, 3)>, <5, (6, 0, 3)>, <5, (2, 0, 3)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, 3, 2)>, 
    <6, (7, 3, 8)>, <6, (7, 2, 8)>, <6, (3, 2, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <7, (9, 6, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <8, (6, 3, 2)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - Unique 3-star: <9, (5, 1, 7)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
