Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 10
