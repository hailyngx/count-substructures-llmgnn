Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {18, 14, 16, 11, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 14, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 5, 19, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 19, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 14, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {12, 19, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 18, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 17, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {0, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 8, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {4, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {12, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 11, 2, 9} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
