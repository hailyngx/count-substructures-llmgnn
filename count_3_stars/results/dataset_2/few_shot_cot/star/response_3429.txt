Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 6, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (5, 8, 3)>
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 7, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <3, (9, 2, 8)>, <3, (9, 8, 7)>, <3, (9, 7, 6)>, <3, (2, 8, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 6)>, <3, (8, 7, 6)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <8, (9, 2, 3)>, <8, (9, 2, 1)>, <8, (9, 2, 7)>, <8, (9, 3, 1)>, <8, (9, 3, 7)>, <8, (9, 1, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 1)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 1, 7)>, <8, (3, 1, 7)>
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 3, 1, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 0)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (5, 1, 0)>, <9, (8, 4, 3)>, <9, (8, 4, 1)>, <9, (8, 4, 0)>, <9, (8, 3, 1)>, <9, (8, 3, 0)>, <9, (8, 1, 0)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (4, 3, 0)>, <9, (4, 1, 0)>, <9, (3, 1, 0)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 6
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 20
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 6 + 10 + 20 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
