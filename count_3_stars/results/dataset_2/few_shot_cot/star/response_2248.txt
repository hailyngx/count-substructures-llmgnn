Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 26} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {3, 24, 15} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 27: 10
- From Node 28: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 52

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
