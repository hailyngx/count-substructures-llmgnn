Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 8} (2 neighbors)  
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 4, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 4} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 4, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 4, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 2, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 4  
- From Node 2: 10  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 5: 10  
- From Node 6: 1  
- From Node 7: 4  
- From Node 8: 10  
- From Node 9: 10  

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54  
Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
