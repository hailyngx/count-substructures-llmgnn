Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 16, 17, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
