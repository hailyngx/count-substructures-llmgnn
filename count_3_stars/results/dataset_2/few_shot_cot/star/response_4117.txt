Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars it participates in:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 5} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 0, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 26: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
