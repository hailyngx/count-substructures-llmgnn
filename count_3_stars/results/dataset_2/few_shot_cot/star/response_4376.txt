Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
        
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 1, 2, 8} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - Unique 3-star: <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (9, 4, 1)>, <3, (9, 4, 2)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 6} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
