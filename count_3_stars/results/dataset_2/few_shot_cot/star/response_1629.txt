Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 16, 11, 4, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 19, 16, 15} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {19, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 1} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {12, 15, 0, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {12, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 10, 17, 11} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 17, 15, 18} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {2, 13, 10, 19} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {2, 0, 1, 18} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {12, 13} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {13, 16} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {2, 15, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
