- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 4, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 0)>, <7, (2, 4, 0)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
