Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 15, 4} (3 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12} (1 neighbor)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {14, 8} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 19, 0} (4 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {17, 15} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 15, 18, 19} (4 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 7**: Not connected to any other nodes.  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {3} (1 neighbor)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 17, 13, 0} (5 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {17, 0, 18} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 4} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 18, 2} (3 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 0} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 15} (2 neighbors)  
Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 16, 5, 14} (5 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {15, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 1, 5, 18} (5 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {6, 10, 17, 19, 12} (5 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {6, 16, 18, 4} (4 neighbors)  
Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 4  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 6: 4  
- From Node 9: 10  
- From Node 10: 1  
- From Node 12: 1  
- From Node 15: 10  
- From Node 16: 1  
- From Node 17: 10  
- From Node 18: 10  
- From Node 19: 4  

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 60  
Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
