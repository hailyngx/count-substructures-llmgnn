Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <0, (5, 6, 1)> 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 2, 9, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <1, (4, 8, 2)>, <1, (4, 2, 9)>, <1, (8, 2, 7)>, <1, (8, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 9, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 6, 1, 9, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - <2, (8, 5, 6)>, <2, (8, 1, 7)>, <2, (8, 1, 9)>, <2, (8, 2, 7)>, <2, (8, 2, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 2)>, <2, (5, 2, 7)>, <2, (5, 2, 9)>, <2, (6, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 9, 2)>, <2, (1, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 2, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 5, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <5, (6, 2, 5)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - <8, (4, 2, 1)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 3, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 9, 0)>
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 = [52]

Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
