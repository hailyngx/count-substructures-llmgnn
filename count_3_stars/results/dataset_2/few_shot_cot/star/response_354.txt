Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - The 3-stars involving Node 2:
    - <2, (5, 7, 3)>
    - <2, (5, 7, 0)>
    - <2, (7, 3, 0)>
    - <2, (5, 3, 0)>

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - The 3-stars involving Node 3:
    - <3, (5, 4, 6)>
    - <3, (5, 6, 2)>
    - <3, (4, 6, 2)>
    - <3, (5, 4, 2)>

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - The 3-stars involving Node 4:
    - <4, (7, 8, 3)>
    - <4, (7, 3, 1)>
    - <4, (8, 3, 1)>
    - <4, (7, 8, 1)>

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - The 3-stars involving Node 6:
    - <6, (9, 3, 8)>
    - <6, (9, 3, 0)>
    - <6, (9, 8, 0)>
    - <6, (3, 8, 0)>

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 2, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
