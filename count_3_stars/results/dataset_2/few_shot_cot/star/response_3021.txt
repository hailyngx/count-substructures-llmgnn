Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
   
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 18, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 17} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 18, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 3} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 6, 19} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 15, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {19, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {16, 1, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {16, 4, 18, 14} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {14, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {12, 3, 9, 10} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {7, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {9, 5, 10} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {11, 19, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 1, 17} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
  - From Node 0: 10
  - From Node 1: 1
  - From Node 2: 1
  - From Node 3: 4
  - From Node 5: 4
  - From Node 7: 1
  - From Node 9: 4
  - From Node 10: 4
  - From Node 14: 4
  - From Node 16: 1
  - From Node 17: 1
  - From Node 18: 1
  - From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
