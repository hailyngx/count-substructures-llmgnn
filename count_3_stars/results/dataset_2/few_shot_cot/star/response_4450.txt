Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars: <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 8, 0, 5} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - 3-Stars: <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (7, 4, 5)>, <3, (7, 4, 8)>, <3, (7, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 8, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 3)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 4, 3, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 3)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (4, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 0, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 2)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>, <9, (1, 7, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 3)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 2)>, <9, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (7, 4, 3)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 58

Therefore, there are a total of [58] 3-stars in your graph.
