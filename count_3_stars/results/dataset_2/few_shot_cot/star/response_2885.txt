Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 76

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
