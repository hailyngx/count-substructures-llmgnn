Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 3, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8, 3, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 8, 0, 5} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 2, 8, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 2, 5, 3, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
