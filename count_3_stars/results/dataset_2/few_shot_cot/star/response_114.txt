Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 3, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <2, (10, 3, 16)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 2} (3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
