Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 4
