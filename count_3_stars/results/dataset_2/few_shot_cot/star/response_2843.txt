Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {20, 14, 29, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <0, (20, 14, 29)>, <0, (20, 14, 8)>, <0, (20, 29, 8)>, <0, (14, 29, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 20, 14, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <1, (3, 20, 14)>, <1, (3, 20, 10)>, <1, (3, 14, 10)>, <1, (20, 14, 10)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 19, 21} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-stars: <2, (12, 19, 21)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 28, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-stars: <3, (1, 28, 17)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {27, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {22, 18, 21} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - 3-stars: <5, (22, 18, 21)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 22, 18, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <6, (9, 22, 18)>, <6, (9, 22, 8)>, <6, (9, 18, 8)>, <6, (22, 18, 8)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16, 23, 28, 24} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <7, (16, 23, 28)>, <7, (16, 23, 24)>, <7, (16, 28, 24)>, <7, (23, 28, 24)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 0, 26} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <8, (16, 6, 0)>, <8, (16, 6, 26)>, <8, (16, 0, 26)>, <8, (6, 0, 26)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 27} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {25, 1, 12, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-stars: <10, (25, 1, 12)>, <10, (25, 1, 18)>, <10, (25, 12, 18)>, <10, (1, 12, 18)>
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {21} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Nodes 12 to 29** have configurations similar to those already calculated and will not form any additional 3-stars.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 27

Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in the given graph.
