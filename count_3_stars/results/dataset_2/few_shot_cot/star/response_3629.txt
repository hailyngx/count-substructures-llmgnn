Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 25: 4
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 66

Therefore, there are a total of [66] 3-stars in your graph.
