Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbours = {4, 14, 3, 5, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbours = {13, 4, 7, 12, 0, 5} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbours = {7, 5, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbours = {7, 0, 14, 9, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbours = {8, 12, 9, 0, 14, 1} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbours = {7, 0, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbours = {8, 10, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbours = {12, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbours = {4, 10, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbours = {10, 11, 4, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbours = {8, 11, 6, 9} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbours = {10, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbours = {4, 7, 6, 1} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbours = {1} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbours = {4, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 103

Therefore, there are a total of [103] 3-stars in your graph.
