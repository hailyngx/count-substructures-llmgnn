Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {27, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {14, 22, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1

- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 1
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 4
