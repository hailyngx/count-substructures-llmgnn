Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 7} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 2, 4)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (9, 2, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 4, 3)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 1, 4)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 3)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 8, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 0, 6, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 3, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
