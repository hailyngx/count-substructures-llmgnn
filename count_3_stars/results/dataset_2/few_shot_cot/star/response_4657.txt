Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4, 2, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 46

Therefore, there are a total of [46] 3-stars in your graph.
