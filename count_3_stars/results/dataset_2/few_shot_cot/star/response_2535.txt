Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 4: 1 
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 1
