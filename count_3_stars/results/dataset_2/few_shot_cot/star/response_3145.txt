Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 10, 15, 19} (5 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 12} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 18} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 12} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 11} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 10} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 13, 10, 11} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {18, 0} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 1} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 14, 10, 19} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 6} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 16, 3} (3 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {8, 2, 15, 6} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 19, 16} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {13, 0} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {14, 12} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {14, 6, 19} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 7} (2 neighbors)
   - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 17, 0} (4 neighbors)
   - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
