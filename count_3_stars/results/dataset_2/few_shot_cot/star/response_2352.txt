Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
