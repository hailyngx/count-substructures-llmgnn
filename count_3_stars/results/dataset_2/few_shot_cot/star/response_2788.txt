Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {19, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 10, 16, 14} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {13, 2, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {10, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {5, 17, 18, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {9, 14} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 4} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 6} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 11} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {0, 19, 8, 16} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 38
Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
