Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 11, 10, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {2, 11, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 7, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {12, 10, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 13, 12, 11, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 14, 7, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({3 \choose 3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 12, 2, 3, 1, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 14, 0, 6, 11} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 3, 10, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 20
- From Node 12: 20
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 100

Therefore, there are a total of [100] 3-stars in your graph.
