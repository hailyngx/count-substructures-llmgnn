Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 8, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 7, 3, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 3, 1} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 2: 4
        - From Node 3: 10
        - From Node 4: 4
        - From Node 6: 20
        - From Node 7: 4
        - From Node 8: 10
        - From Node 9: 10
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 60
        Therefore, there are a total of [60] 3-stars in your graph.
