Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 3, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 10, 2, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {12, 4, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 10, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 14, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 14, 7, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 1, 11, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 13, 10, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 11, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 13, 11, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 20
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 82

Therefore, there are a total of [82] 3-stars in your graph.
