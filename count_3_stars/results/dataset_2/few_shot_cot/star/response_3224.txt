Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {28, 19, 1} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 8, 19} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
