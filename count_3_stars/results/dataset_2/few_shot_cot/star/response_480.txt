Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 6} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 0, 1, 6} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)  
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)  

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 1  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 2: 4  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 4: 10  
- From Node 5: 4  
- From Node 6: 10  
- From Node 7: 10  
- From Node 8: 4  
- From Node 9: 4  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 49  
Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
