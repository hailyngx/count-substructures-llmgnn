Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 17, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 15, 0, 18} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {11, 10, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 9, 17} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {0, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 18, 9, 1} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {13, 2} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 6} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 17, 3} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {16, 5, 15, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {1, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {12, 18, 4, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {4, 8, 13, 0} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 1, 19} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 14} (2 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
