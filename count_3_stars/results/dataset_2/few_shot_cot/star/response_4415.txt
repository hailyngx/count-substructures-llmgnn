Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- Node 0: Neighbors = {6, 4, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 1: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 8, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- Node 2: Neighbors = {6, 1, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 3: Neighbors = {6, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 4: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 0, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 5: Neighbors = {6, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 7: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 4, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 8: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: Neighbors = {8, 4, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
