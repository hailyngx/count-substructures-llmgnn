- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {7, 19, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 18, 0, 14, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 4, 0} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {7, 4, 1} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 6, 10} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
