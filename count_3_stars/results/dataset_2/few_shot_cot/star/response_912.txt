Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 12, 13} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 2, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 5, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 14, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 4, 2, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 13} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 5, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {14, 10, 7} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 8} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 10, 0, 13} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 0, 2, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 4, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Node does not have any neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 10
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 10
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 11: 10
- Node 12: 10
- Node 13: 10
- Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 74

Therefore, there are a total of [74] 3-stars in your graph.
