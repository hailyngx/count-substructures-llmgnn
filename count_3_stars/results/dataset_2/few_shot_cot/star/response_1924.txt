Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {12, 26, 17} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {29, 5} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {26, 16} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
