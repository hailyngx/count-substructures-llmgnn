Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 17} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 9} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {14, 13, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 13, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 19} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 8, 13, 2} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 17} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {16, 12, 6} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 10, 1} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 9, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 18, 5} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {15, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 18, 2, 6} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 9, 12} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {10, 8, 18} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {7, 1, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 16, 13} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {7, 5} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
