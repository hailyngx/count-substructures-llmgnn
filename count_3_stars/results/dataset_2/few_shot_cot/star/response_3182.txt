Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
  - 3-Stars: <0, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (5, 6, 2)>, <0, (5, 4, 8)>, <0, (5, 4, 2)>, <0, (6, 4, 8)>, <0, (6, 4, 2)>, <0, (4, 8, 2)>, <0, (5, 6, 4)>, <0, (5, 8, 2)>, <0, (6, 8, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
  - 3-Stars: <1, (5, 9, 6)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 0, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
  - 3-Stars: <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 0, 7)>, <2, (9, 0, 7)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
  - 3-Stars: <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 4, 7)>, <3, (6, 4, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
  - 3-Stars: <4, (9, 0, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 8, 1, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
  - 3-Stars: <5, (2, 8, 1)>, <5, (2, 1, 3)>, <5, (2, 1, 0)>, <5, (2, 3, 0)>, <5, (8, 1, 3)>, <5, (8, 1, 0)>, <5, (8, 3, 0)>, <5, (1, 3, 0)>, <5, (2, 8, 3)>, <5, (2, 8, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 3, 8, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)  
  - 3-Stars: <6, (1, 7, 3)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (7, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 0)>, <6, (1, 3, 0)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (7, 3, 0)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>, <6, (3, 8, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 
  - 3-Stars: <7, (9, 6, 2)>, <7, (9, 6, 3)>, <7, (9, 2, 3)>, <7, (6, 2, 3)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)  
  - 3-Stars: <8, (5, 6, 0)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)  
  - 3-Stars: <9, (4, 2, 1)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 49

Therefore, there are a total of [49] 3-stars in your graph.
