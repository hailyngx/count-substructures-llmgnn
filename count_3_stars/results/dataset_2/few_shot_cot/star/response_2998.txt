Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 20  
- From Node 1: 20  
- From Node 2: 10  
- From Node 3: 1  
- From Node 5: 1  
- From Node 6: 4  
- From Node 7: 4  
- From Node 8: 4  
- From Node 9: 1  
- From Node 10: 4  
- From Node 11: 10  
- From Node 12: 1  
- From Node 13: 4  
- From Node 14: 4  

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 20 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 83  
Therefore, there are a total of [83] 3-stars in your graph.
