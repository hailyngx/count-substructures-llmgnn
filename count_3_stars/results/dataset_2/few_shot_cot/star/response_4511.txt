Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all the valid configurations:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 5
- Node 5: 1 
- Node 6: 1
- Node 9: 4
- Node 10: 10
- Node 11: 1
- Node 12: 4
- Node 13: 1
- Node 17: 4
- Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
