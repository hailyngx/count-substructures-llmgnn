Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors.

- **Node 0:** Neighbors = {7, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 1:** Neighbors = {11, 17, 16, 14, 19} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 2:** Neighbors = {6, 10, 11} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3:** Neighbors = {9, 17, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 4:** Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 5:** Neighbors = {11, 7, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 6:** Neighbors = {9, 15, 2, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 7:** Neighbors = {8, 0, 10, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 8:** Neighbors = {17} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9:** Neighbors = {6, 15, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 10:** Neighbors = {18, 2, 7, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 11:** Neighbors = {2, 1, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 12:** Neighbors = {6, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13:** Neighbors = {18} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 14:** Neighbors = {3, 1, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 15:** Neighbors = {6, 9, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 16:** Neighbors = {1, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17:** Neighbors = {8, 3, 0, 1, 16} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 18:** Neighbors = {4, 10, 15, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 19:** Neighbors = {1, 14, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing up the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
