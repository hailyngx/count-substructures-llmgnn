Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 47

Therefore, there are a total of [47] 3-stars in your graph.
