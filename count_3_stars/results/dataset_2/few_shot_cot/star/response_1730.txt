Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 2)>, <0, (4, 6, 2)>, <0, (3, 6, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 6, 8, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <1, (9, 3, 6)>, <1, (9, 3, 8)>, <1, (9, 3, 7)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (9, 6, 7)>, <1, (9, 8, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 8, 7)>, <1, (6, 8, 7)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8, 7, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <2, (5, 4, 8)>, <2, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 4, 0)>, <2, (5, 8, 7)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <2, (4, 8, 7)>, <2, (4, 8, 0)>, <2, (4, 7, 0)>, <2, (8, 7, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <3, (1, 0, 4)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 8, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <4, (5, 3, 8)>, <4, (5, 3, 2)>, <4, (5, 3, 0)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 2, 0)>, <4, (3, 8, 2)>, <4, (3, 8, 0)>, <4, (3, 2, 0)>, <4, (8, 2, 0)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-star: <5, (9, 2, 4)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <6, (1, 8, 7)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (1, 7, 0)>, <6, (8, 7, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 8, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
  - 3-stars: <7, (1, 8, 6)>, <7, (1, 8, 2)>, <7, (1, 6, 2)>, <7, (8, 6, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 2, 7, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
  - 3-stars: <8, (1, 4, 2)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 7, 6)>, <8, (4, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 2, 6)>, <8, (4, 7, 6)>, <8, (2, 7, 6)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
