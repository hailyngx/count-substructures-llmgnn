Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 15, 5, 9} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 16, 11, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 10, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 13, 11, 16} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {17, 15, 2, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {16, 10, 18} (3 neighbors)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {11, 3, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 10, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 18: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 34

Therefore, there are a total of [34] 3-stars in your graph.
