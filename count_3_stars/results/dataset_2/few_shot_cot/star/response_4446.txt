Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From the calculations above:  
  - Nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28 have 1 3-star each.
- Total number of 3-stars = 22

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in your graph.
