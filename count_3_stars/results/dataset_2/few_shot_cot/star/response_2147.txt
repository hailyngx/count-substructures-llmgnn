Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {13, 7, 10, 12} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 18, 4} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 19, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 17, 15, 18, 16} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 11, 9, 17} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {14} (1 neighbor)

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 15, 3} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {7, 17, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5, 0, 2, 16} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {19, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {8} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {10, 6} (2 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Summing up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 36

Therefore, there are a total of [36] 3-stars in your graph.
