Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (5, 9, 1)>, <0, (5, 2, 1)>, <0, (9, 2, 1)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 9, 0, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 0)>, <1, (5, 8, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 0)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 0, 4)>, <1, (8, 9, 0)>, <1, (8, 9, 4)>, <1, (8, 0, 4)>, <1, (9, 0, 4)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 0)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>, <2, (6, 9, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 3, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <4, (5, 6, 3)>, <4, (5, 6, 1)>, <4, (5, 3, 1)>, <4, (6, 3, 1)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 8, 1, 4, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - 3-stars: <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 2, 1)>, <5, (6, 2, 4)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, (6, 8, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 4)>, <5, (2, 8, 1)>, <5, (2, 8, 4)>, <5, (2, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 4)>, <5, (6, 2, 0)>, <5, (6, 8, 0)>, <5, (6, 1, 0)>, <5, (6, 4, 0)>, <5, (2, 8, 0)>, <5, (2, 1, 0)>, <5, (2, 4, 0)>, <5, (8, 1, 0)>, <5, (8, 4, 0)>, <5, (1, 4, 0)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 2, 4} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - 3-stars: <6, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <6, (5, 7, 4)>, <6, (5, 3, 2)>, <6, (5, 3, 4)>, <6, (7, 3, 2)>, <6, (7, 3, 4)>, <6, (7, 2, 4)>, <6, (3, 2, 4)>, <6, (5, 2, 4)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 1, 7, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - 3-stars: <9, (2, 1, 7)>, <9, (2, 1, 0)>, <9, (2, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 9: 4
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
