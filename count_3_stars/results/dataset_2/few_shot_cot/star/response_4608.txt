Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 7, 2, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 8, 12, 0} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 11, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {10, 8} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {8, 12, 0, 14} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 14, 7, 3} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {10, 4, 2, 5, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 2, 14, 3, 12} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 4, 13, 14} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 2, 5} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 1, 10, 8, 5} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 85

Therefore, there are a total of [85] 3-stars in your graph.
