Response:
Given the adjacency list provided, we will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors.

Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {20, 16, 9, 26} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {27, 29, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {21, 8, 6, 25} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {18, 26, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 1
