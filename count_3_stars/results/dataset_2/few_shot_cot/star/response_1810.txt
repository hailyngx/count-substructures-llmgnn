Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 20
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 20
- From Node 11: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 102

Therefore, there are a total of [102] 3-stars in your graph.
