Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 16, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 14, 9, 7} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 16, 17} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 4, 9} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 18, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {15, 14} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 4, 17} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {15, 9} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {3, 1, 0, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {11, 12} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {10, 18} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {10, 13} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {15, 7, 12} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 5} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 13, 5, 16} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {15, 0, 19, 17, 2} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {16, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {11, 4} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {2, 16} (2 neighbors)
    - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = [42]

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
