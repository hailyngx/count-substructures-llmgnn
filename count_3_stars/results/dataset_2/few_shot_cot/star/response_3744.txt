Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll consider each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {2, 14, 19, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {8, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 13, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {6, 15, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 10, 18} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {2, 5, 15, 10, 17} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {2, 11} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 9**: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 5, 19, 17} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {1, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {14, 16, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 18, 19, 13} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {4, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {13, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {11, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {14, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 11, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 43

Therefore, there are a total of [43] 3-stars in your graph.
