Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will analyze each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {10, 13, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <0, (10, 13, 9)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {19, 12, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - 3-stars: <1, (19, 12, 16)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 0
- From Node 3: 0
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 0
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 0
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 0
- From Node 19: 1
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 37

Therefore, there are a total of [37] 3-stars in your graph.
