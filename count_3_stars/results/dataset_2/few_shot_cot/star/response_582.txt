Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {11, 17} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {11, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {18, 5} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {19, 14, 13} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 13, 14} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 12, 16} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 18, 11} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {1, 16, 10, 9, 13} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 16, 6} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {1, 7, 13} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 14} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 15, 0, 6, 17} (5 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{5}{3} = 10\)
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {5} (1 neighbor)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 9} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 19, 3, 10} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 11} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {8, 7, 5} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {15, 11, 0} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {2, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {18, 14, 3} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 1: 1
        - From Node 3: 1
        - From Node 4: 1
        - From Node 5: 1
        - From Node 6: 1
        - From Node 7: 10
        - From Node 8: 1
        - From Node 9: 1
        - From Node 11: 10
        - From Node 13: 4
        - From Node 14: 4
        - From Node 16: 1
        - From Node 17: 1
        - From Node 18: 1
        - From Node 19: 1
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 38

        Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in your graph.
