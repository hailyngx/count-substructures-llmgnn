Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 4, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1 (Only 1 possible combination with 3 neighbors)
  - <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 15, 10} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - <1, (6, 15, 10)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 7, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - <2, (13, 7, 4)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {0, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 12, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 4
  - <4, (9, 0, 12)>, <4, (9, 0, 2)>, <4, (9, 12, 2)>, <4, (0, 12, 2)>

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {4} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {11, 8, 2, 19, 18} (5 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - <14, (6, 3, 19)>
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {16, 1} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {11, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {11, 7, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - <17, (11, 7, 5)>
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {13, 10} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 14} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 1
  - <19, (9, 13, 14)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
