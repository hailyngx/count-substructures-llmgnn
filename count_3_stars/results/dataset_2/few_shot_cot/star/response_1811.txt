Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - 3-Stars: <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 2, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 7)>, <5, (0, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 4, 8, 7, 2} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - 3-Stars: <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 6)>, <6, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 4, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - 3-Stars: <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 8)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 8)>
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 2, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10 = [52]
Therefore, there are a total of [52] 3-stars in your graph.
