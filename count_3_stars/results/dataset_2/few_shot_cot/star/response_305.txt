Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <0, (5, 7, 1)>, <0, (5, 7, 2)>, <0, (7, 1, 2)>, <0, (5, 1, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <1, (7, 6, 3)>, <1, (7, 6, 0)>, <1, (7, 3, 0)>, <1, (6, 3, 0)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <2, (7, 8, 0)>
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 7, 6, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <3, (9, 4, 7)>, <3, (9, 4, 6)>, <3, (9, 4, 1)>, <3, (9, 7, 6)>, <3, (9, 7, 1)>, <3, (9, 6, 1)>, <3, (4, 7, 6)>, <3, (4, 7, 1)>, <3, (4, 6, 1)>, <3, (7, 6, 1)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 1, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-Stars: <6, (9, 4, 1)>, <6, (9, 4, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (4, 1, 3)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 0, 3, 2, 1} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-Stars: <7, (9, 4, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 3)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <7, (9, 4, 1)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <7, (9, 0, 2)>, <7, (9, 0, 1)>, <7, (9, 3, 2)>, <7, (9, 3, 1)>, <7, (9, 2, 1)>, <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 0, 1)>, <7, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (4, 3, 1)>, <7, (4, 2, 1)>, <7, (0, 3, 2)>, <7, (0, 3, 1)>, <7, (0, 2, 1)>, <7, (3, 2, 1)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-Stars: <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 7)>, <9, (8, 3, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 20
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
