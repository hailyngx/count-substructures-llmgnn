Response:
Given the adjacency list provided for each node in the graph, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node using the formula \(\binom{n}{3}\), considering only nodes with three or more neighbors. Nodes with less than three neighbors cannot form a 3-star.

Here is the calculation for each node:

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {7, 23, 26, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 23, 1, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {15, 17} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {27, 2, 12, 25} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 22, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {21, 20, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 23, 25} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {15, 6, 29} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {22, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {21, 26, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {26, 20, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {3, 23, 9, 29} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 20, 19, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {26, 28, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 20**: Neighbors = {7, 14, 17, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 21**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 28, 12, 24} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 22**: Neighbors = {11, 6, 26, 29} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 23**: Neighbors = {15, 8, 2, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 24**: Neighbors = {21, 18, 19, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

- **Node 25**: Neighbors = {8, 4, 29} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 26**: Neighbors = {1, 22, 18, 13, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10

- **Node 27**: Neighbors = {4, 28, 5} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 28**: Neighbors = {21, 27, 18} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

- **Node 29**: Neighbors = {15, 9, 22, 25} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4

Summing up all valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 10
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 4
- From Node 24: 4
- From Node 26: 10
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 28: 1
- From Node 29: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 61

Therefore, there are a total of [61] 3-stars in your graph.
