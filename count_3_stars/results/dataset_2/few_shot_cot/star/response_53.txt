Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- Node 0: Neighbors = {11, 14, 19, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 1: Neighbors = {9, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 2: Neighbors = {14, 0, 19, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 3: Neighbors = {14, 1, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 4: Neighbors = {11, 3, 18, 6} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 5: Neighbors = {19, 18} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: Neighbors = {4, 8, 15, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 7: Neighbors = {17, 15, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 8: Neighbors = {9, 19, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 9: Neighbors = {8, 14, 1, 13} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 10: No neighbors
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has no neighbors.
- Node 11: Neighbors = {0, 4} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 12: Neighbors = {18, 15} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 13: Neighbors = {9, 6} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 14: Neighbors = {9, 17, 0, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 15: Neighbors = {16, 18, 7, 6, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- Node 16: Neighbors = {15} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 17: Neighbors = {14, 7} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- Node 18: Neighbors = {5, 4, 15, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 19: Neighbors = {5, 0, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 14: 10
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 45

Therefore, there are a total of [45] 3-stars in your graph.
