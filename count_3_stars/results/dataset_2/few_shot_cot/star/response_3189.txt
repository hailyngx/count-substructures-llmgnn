Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <0, (5, 4, 8)>

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 2, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: no new 3-stars

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 7, 1, 3, 8} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3}\) = 20
  - Unique 3-stars: no new 3-stars

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: no new 3-stars

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0, 3, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: no new 3-stars 

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: no new 3-stars 

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {2} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4
  - Unique 3-stars: no new 3-stars

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3}\) = 10
  - Unique 3-stars: no new 3-stars

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 1, 7)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
The total number of 3-stars is the sum of the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 0
- From Node 2: 0
- From Node 4: 0
- From Node 5: 0
- From Node 7: 0
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 2

Therefore, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in your graph.
