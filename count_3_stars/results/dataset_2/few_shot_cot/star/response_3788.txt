Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 15, 17} (3 neighbors)  
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 1  
- From Node 1: 1  
- From Node 2: 1  
- From Node 4: 1  
- From Node 6: 4  
- From Node 7: 1  
- From Node 9: 1  
- From Node 10: 4  
- From Node 11: 1  
- From Node 12: 1  
- From Node 14: 4  
- From Node 15: 1  
- From Node 16: 4  
- From Node 17: 1  
- From Node 18: 1  
- From Node 19: 1  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 27  
Therefore, there are a total of [27] 3-stars in this graph.
