Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3)

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 1, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 8, 1, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 1, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 2, 3, 7, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 20

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
