Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
        Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
        - **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 16, 12} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 19} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 2**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 14} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 3**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 18} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 16, 12, 14} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 11} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 7} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 7**: Neighbors = {6, 9, 15} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 8**: Neighbors = {0, 12} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 9**: Neighbors = {16, 7, 13} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 10**: Neighbors = {15, 3, 19, 2} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 13} (2 neighbors)
        - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
        - **Node 12**: Neighbors = {8, 0, 4, 13} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 13**: Neighbors = {9, 12, 11} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 2, 18} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 15**: Neighbors = {17, 10, 7, 18} (4 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{4}{3} = 4\)
        - **Node 16**: Neighbors = {9, 0, 4} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 17**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 18**: Neighbors = {15, 3, 14} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
        - **Node 19**: Neighbors = {1, 10, 4} (3 neighbors)
        - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)

        Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
        Add up all the valid configurations:
        - From Node 0: 1
        - From Node 2: 1
        - From Node 3: 1
        - From Node 4: 4
        - From Node 6: 1
        - From Node 7: 1
        - From Node 9: 1
        - From Node 10: 4
        - From Node 12: 4
        - From Node 13: 1
        - From Node 14: 1
        - From Node 15: 4
        - From Node 16: 1
        - From Node 17: 1
        - From Node 18: 1
        - From Node 19: 1
        Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 28

        Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in your graph.
