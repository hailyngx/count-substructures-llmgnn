Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 10
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 23: 10
