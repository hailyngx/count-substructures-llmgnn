Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 7, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 6} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 0, 6, 8, 4} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{6}{3} = 20

- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4

- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {2, 4, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{3}{3} = 1

- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{4}{3} = 4

- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 8, 0, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 2, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = inom{5}{3} = 10

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
