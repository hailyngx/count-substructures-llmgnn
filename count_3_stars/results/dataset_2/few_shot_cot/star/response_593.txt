Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- Node 0: 1

- Node 2: 10
- Node 4: 10
- Node 5: 10
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 1
- Node 10: 20
- Node 11: 4
- Node 12: 20
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 93

Therefore, there are a total of [93] 3-stars in your graph.
