Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 25: 10
