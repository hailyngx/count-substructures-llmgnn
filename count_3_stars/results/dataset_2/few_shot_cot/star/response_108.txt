Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 3

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 8, 5, 6} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 2, 5, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 3, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 9, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 6, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 5, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 9, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {7, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, there are a total of [54] 3-stars in your graph.
