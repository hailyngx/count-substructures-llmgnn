Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {15, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding all valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 33

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in your graph.
