Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {7, 6, 2} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <0, (7, 6, 2)>
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 5, 9, 8} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 0} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 6, 9, 5} (5 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
    - <3, (4, 1, 6)>, <3, (4, 1, 9)>, <3, (4, 1, 5)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 5)>, <3, (4, 9, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 5)>, <3, (1, 9, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 5)>
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <4, (7, 9, 6)>, <4, (7, 9, 3)>, <4, (7, 6, 3)>, <4, (9, 6, 3)>
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
    - <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 3, 8, 5, 0} (6 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
    - <6, (4, 7, 3)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 5)>, <6, (4, 3, 8)>, <6, (4, 3, 5)>, <6, (4, 8, 5)>, <6, (7, 3, 8)>, <6, (7, 3, 5)>, <6, (7, 8, 5)>, <6, (3, 8, 5)>, <6, (4, 7, 0)>, <6, (4, 3, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>, <6, (4, 5, 0)>, <6, (7, 3, 0)>, <6, (7, 8, 0)>, <6, (7, 5, 0)>, <6, (3, 8, 0)>, <6, (3, 5, 0)>, <6, (8, 5, 0)>
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 0, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
    - <7, (4, 0, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 2)>, <7, (4, 6, 2)>, <7, (0, 6, 2)>
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 9, 6} (3 neighbors)
    - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

    - <9, (4, 1, 3)>, <9, (4, 1, 8)>, <9, (4, 1, 2)>, <9, (4, 3, 8)>, <9, (4, 3, 2)>, <9, (4, 8, 2)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 3, 2)>, <9, (1, 8, 2)>, <9, (3, 8, 2)>

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 20
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 56

Therefore, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in your graph.
