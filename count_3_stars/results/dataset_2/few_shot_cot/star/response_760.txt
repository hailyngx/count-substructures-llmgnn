Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 10, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {0, 10, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {6, 4, 13, 10, 12, 14} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 13, 3, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 8, 0, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 11, 0, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 8, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 3, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {8, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 14, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 4, 3, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {4, 12, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(	\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 10
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 14: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in your graph.
