Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 19} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {6, 19, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(inom{3}{3} = 1\)
  - <1, (6, 9, 19)>

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 3
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 39

Therefore, there are a total of [39] 3-stars in your graph.
