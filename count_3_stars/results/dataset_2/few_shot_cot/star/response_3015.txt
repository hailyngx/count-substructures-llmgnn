Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 9: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 25: 4
