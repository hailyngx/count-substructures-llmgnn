Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 7, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 13, 10, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 14, 12, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(5,3) = 10 \)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 6, 14, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(5,3) = 10 \)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 13} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(3,3) = 1 \)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 2, 11, 4, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(5,3) = 10 \)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {8, 14, 7, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {8, 6, 0, 1} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {11, 0, 6, 3, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(5,3) = 10 \)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(3,3) = 1 \)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {13, 1, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(3,3) = 1 \)
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {5, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {13, 0, 14, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 4, 1, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(4,3) = 4 \)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {6, 0, 3, 12, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \text{inom}(5,3) = 10 \)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Adding up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 12: 4
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 77

Therefore, there are a total of [77] 3-stars in your graph.
