Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {22, 27, 14, 25, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {13, 12, 19} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {28, 9} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {13, 15, 10, 20} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {21, 18, 24} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 19: 4
- From Node 20: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 26: 4
- From Node 27: 4
- From Node 28: 4
- From Node 29: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in your graph.
