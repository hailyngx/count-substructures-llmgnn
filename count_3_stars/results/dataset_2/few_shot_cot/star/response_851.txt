Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will determine the number of 3-stars around each node:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {9, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 14, 4, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <1, (5, 3, 4)>
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 11, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 11, 7, 0, 14, 10} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - <3, (1, 7, 10)>
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 10, 14} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {6, 13, 8, 1, 7} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <5, (1, 7, 6)>
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7, 10, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <6, (5, 7, 10)>
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 3, 8} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - <7, (1, 5, 3)>
  
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 7} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {6, 8, 14, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 3, 2, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 2, 12} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {6, 11, 4} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {5, 2} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 3, 4} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 20
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 10
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 84

Therefore, there are a total of [84] 3-stars in the given graph.
