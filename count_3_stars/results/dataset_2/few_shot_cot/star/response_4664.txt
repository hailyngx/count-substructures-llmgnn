Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 13, 14, 11} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 6, 10} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 4, 14, 12, 10} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 10, 13, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {0, 11, 6, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 3, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 11, 6, 14, 1} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {13, 10, 11, 12} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {2, 14} (2 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star with less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {1, 3, 8, 2} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 8, 0, 14} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 2} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 0, 11, 2} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 2: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 10
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 53

Therefore, there are a total of [53] 3-stars in your graph.
