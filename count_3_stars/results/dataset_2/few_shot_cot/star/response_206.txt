Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 13: 4
- From Node 14: 4
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 16: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
