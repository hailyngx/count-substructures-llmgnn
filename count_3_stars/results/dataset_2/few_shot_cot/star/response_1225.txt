Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list you provided, we'll examine each node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {1, 18, 7, 15} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {17, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {9, 11, 18, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {11, 14, 19} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {9} (1 neighbor)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 17, 16, 7} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 15} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {5, 0} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {9, 19, 15} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 8, 4, 2} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {6, 18} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {3, 2} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {16, 13} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {12, 19, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 15} (2 neighbors)
- Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {0, 8, 14, 6} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 16**: Neighbors = {5, 12, 17, 19, 13} (5 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 17**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 16} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 18**: Neighbors = {10, 2, 0} (3 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 19**: Neighbors = {3, 8, 13, 16} (4 neighbors)
- Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 1
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 10
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in your graph.
