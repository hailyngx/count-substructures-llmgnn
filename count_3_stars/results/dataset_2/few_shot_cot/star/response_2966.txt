Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 6, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 3, 6, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {1, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {5, 4, 1, 8} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 3} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 4, 0, 3} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {9, 1, 8, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {9, 8, 1} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 3, 6, 2, 0} (6 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 6, 1, 7} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 20
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 20
- From Node 9: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 20 + 4 = 67

Therefore, there are a total of [67] 3-stars in your graph.
