Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- 3-Stars from Node 0: 1
- 3-Stars from Node 1: 1
- 3-Stars from Node 2: 4
- 3-Stars from Node 3: 1
- 3-Stars from Node 4: 1
- 3-Stars from Node 5: 10
- 3-Stars from Node 6: 4
- 3-Stars from Node 7: 20
- 3-Stars from Node 8: 1
- 3-Stars from Node 9: 20
- 3-Stars from Node 10: 4
- 3-Stars from Node 11: 4
- 3-Stars from Node 12: 10
- 3-Stars from Node 13: 4
