Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:

- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 1
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 8: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 10
- From Node 15: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 22: 4
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 1
- From Node 27: 1
- From Node 29: 10

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 50
