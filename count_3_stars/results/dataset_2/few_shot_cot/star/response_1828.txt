Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2)

Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1

Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {4, 6, 1, 8, 2} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {5, 9, 3, 0, 8} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {7, 8, 0} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {9, 7, 6, 1, 8} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {5, 7, 0} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {9, 6, 8, 1, 4} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 0} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 2} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {5, 1, 3, 2, 0} (5 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {5, 3, 1} (3 neighbors)
  Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 10
- From Node 2: 1
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 1
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 7: 1
- From Node 8: 10
- From Node 9: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 55

Therefore, there are a total of [55] 3-stars in your graph.
