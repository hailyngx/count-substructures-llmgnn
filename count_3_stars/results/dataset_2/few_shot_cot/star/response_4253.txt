Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node:  
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {3, 12, 11, 10, 8} (5 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {3, 11, 5, 13, 8} (5 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {10, 9, 13} (3 neighbors)  
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 14, 10, 6} (5 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)
  
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {7, 9, 13, 6} (4 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {1, 11} (2 neighbors)  
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
  
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 12, 11, 14, 8} (6 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({6 \choose 3} = 20\)
  
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {4, 10, 9} (3 neighbors)  
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {1, 12, 0, 14, 6} (5 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({5 \choose 3} = 10\)

- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {4, 7, 2} (3 neighbors)  
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 10**: Neighbors = {7, 3, 0, 2} (4 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

- **Node 11**: Neighbors = {1, 0, 5, 6} (4 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {0, 6, 8} (3 neighbors)  
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 1, 2, 14} (4 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)

- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {3, 6, 8, 13} (4 neighbors)  
   Number of 3-star configurations = \({4 \choose 3} = 4\)
  
Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:  
Add up all the valid configurations:  
- From Node 0: 10  
- From Node 1: 10  
- From Node 3: 10  
- From Node 4: 4  
- From Node 6: 20  
- From Node 8: 10  
- From Node 10: 4  
- From Node 11: 4  
- From Node 13: 4  

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 76  

Therefore, there are a total of [76] 3-stars in your graph.
