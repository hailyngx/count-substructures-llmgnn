Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 4
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 3: 10
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 6: 4
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 1
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 15: 10
- From Node 21: 1
- From Node 23: 1
- From Node 24: 1
- From Node 25: 10
- From Node 26: 1
- From Node 27: 10
