Response:
Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {16, 8, 9} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10} (1 neighbor)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {12, 5, 6, 3} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {2, 6, 13, 5} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- **Node 4**: Neighbors = {19, 13} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 5**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- **Node 6**: Neighbors = {11, 2, 3} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- **Node 7**: Neighbors = {12, 8} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 8**: Neighbors = {7, 0, 17} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- **Node 9**: Neighbors = {0, 14, 15, 17} (4 neighbors)

  - Number of 3-star configurations = $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- **Node 12**: Neighbors = {7, 2, 16} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- **Node 13**: Neighbors = {4, 3, 15} (3 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- **Node 14**: Neighbors = {9, 16} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.
- **Node 15**: Neighbors = {18, 19, 9, 13} (4 neighbors)

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 1
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 1
- From Node 6: 1
- From Node 8: 1
- From Node 9: 4
- From Node 10: 1
- From Node 11: 4
- From Node 12: 1
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 15: 4
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 1
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 30

Therefore, there are a total of [30] 3-stars in your graph.
