Calculation of 3-Stars for Each Node
Given the adjacency list provided, we will calculate the number of 3-star configurations for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- **Node 0**: Neighbors = {28, 2, 1, 25, 12} (5 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

- **Node 1**: Neighbors = {10, 20, 9, 0} (4 neighbors)
  - Number of 3-star configurations = \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

- **Node 2**: Neighbors = {19, 0} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

- **Node 3**: Neighbors = {4, 29} (2 neighbors)
  - Cannot form a 3-star as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 0: 10
- From Node 1: 4
- From Node 4: 4
- From Node 5: 4
- From Node 7: 4
- From Node 9: 1

- From Node 12: 10
- From Node 13: 1
- From Node 14: 1
- From Node 16: 1
- From Node 17: 4
- From Node 18: 1
- From Node 19: 1
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 24: 1
