Summing Up the Total Number of 3-Stars:
Add up all the valid configurations:
- From Node 2: 4
- From Node 3: 4
- From Node 5: 10
- From Node 10: 4
- From Node 11: 10
- From Node 18: 4
- From Node 20: 4
- From Node 21: 4
- From Node 23: 4

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 42

Therefore, there are a total of [42] 3-stars in your graph.
