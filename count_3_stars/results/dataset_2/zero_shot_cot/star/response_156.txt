Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3 stars in the graph:

1. Node 4: (4, 3, 6), (4, 5, 7), (4, 6, 9), (4, 2, 7) 
2. Node 7: (7, 2, 4), (7, 4, 9)
3. Node 3: (3, 1, 4), (3, 4, 9)
4. Node 6: (6, 4, 9), (6, 5, 8)
5. Node 9: (9, 4, 7), (9, 3, 6), (9, 6, 8), (9, 2, 5)
6. Node 5: (5, 4, 6), (5, 2, 7), (5, 0, 8)
7. Node 1: (1, 0, 3)
8. Node 8: (8, 5, 6), (8, 1, 9)
9. Node 2: (2, 5, 7), (2, 4, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 1)>
<6, (5, 8, 6)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 8, 5)>
