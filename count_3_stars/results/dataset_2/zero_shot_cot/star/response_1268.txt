Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 2)
- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 9), (2, 0)

2. List the 3-stars based on the identified nodes:
<0, (7, 3, 8)>
<0, (7, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 8, 2)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
