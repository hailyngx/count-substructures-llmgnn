Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 21) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 22) (17, 4) (22, 17) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 18) (23, 21) (23, 16) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 10) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 13) (6, 17) (6, 21) (6, 26) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 6) (21, 8) (21, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 8) (16, 23) (16, 0) (16, 18) (19, 14) (19, 22) (19, 25) (19, 12) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 0) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 13) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 9) (3, 26) (3, 12) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 1) (10, 25) (26, 6) (26, 3) (26, 2) (2, 15) (2, 21) (2, 26) (2, 4) (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 12) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 16) (4, 17) (4, 24) (4, 2) (12, 19) (12, 28) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Nodes connected to node 15: (27, 29, 14) <15, (27, 29, 14)>
2. Nodes connected to node 27: (15, 29, 21) <27, (15, 29, 21)>
3. Nodes connected to node 14: (15, 1, 19) <14, (15, 1, 19)>
4. Nodes connected to node 17: (6, 22, 4) <17, (6, 22, 4)>
5. Nodes connected to node 22: (17, 19, 11) <22, (17, 19, 11)>
6. Nodes connected to node 23: (18, 21, 16) <23, (18, 21, 16)>
7. Nodes connected to node 20: (25, 13, 11) <20, (25, 13, 11)>
8. Nodes connected to node 25: (20, 19, 8) <25, (20, 19, 8)>
9. Nodes connected to node 1: (14, 29, 28) <1, (14, 29, 28)>
10. Nodes connected to node 6: (17, 21, 26) <6, (17, 21, 26)>
11. Nodes connected to node 0: (16, 18, 8) <0, (16, 18, 8)>
12. Nodes connected to node 11: (22, 20, 24) <11, (22, 20, 24)>
13. Nodes connected to node 3: (26, 12, 9) <3, (26, 12, 9)>
14. Nodes connected to node 28: (1, 12, 13) <28, (1, 12, 13)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [14]
