Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star configurations in the given graph where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
