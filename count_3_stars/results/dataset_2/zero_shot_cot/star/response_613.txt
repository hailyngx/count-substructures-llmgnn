Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 9 is the center of the following 3-stars: <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (6, 8, 10)>, <9, (8, 10, 3)>, <9, (10, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 7, 4)>
2. Node 6 is the center of the following 3-stars: <6, (9, 1, 14)>, <6, (1, 14, 7)>, <6, (14, 7, 0)>
3. Node 8 is the center of the following 3-stars: <8, (9, 13, 11)>
4. Node 13 is the center of the following 3-stars: <13, (8, 4, 14)>, <13, (4, 14, 10)>
5. Node 4 is the center of the following 3-stars: <4, (13, 10, 3)>
6. Node 7 is the center of the following 3-stars: <7, (9, 12, 14)>, <7, (12, 14, 1)>
7. Node 3 is the center of the following 3-stars: <3, (9, 4, 12)>, <3, (4, 12, 11)>
8. Node 11 is the center of the following 3-stars: <11, (5, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
