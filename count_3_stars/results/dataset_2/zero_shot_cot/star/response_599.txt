Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 16) (2, 21) (29, 15) (29, 1) (1, 29) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 12) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 25) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 28) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 23) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 0) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 7) (6, 4) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (26, 13) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 10) (21, 2) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 16) (21, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 25) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 9) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 24) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 21) (5, 11) (5, 10) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 20) (10, 8) (10, 28) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 7) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 4) (18, 16) (18, 20) (20, 24) (20, 18) (17, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<15, (27, 29, 14)>
<27, (15, 24, 16)>
<29, (15, 1, -)>
<1, (29, 3, -)>
<3, (1, 21, 12)>
<22, (23, 19, 25)>
<23, (22, 25, 13)>
<8, (13, 10, 6)>
<13, (23, 8, 26)>
<6, (8, 28, 7)>
<28, (23, 6, 10)>
<0, (13, 14, 21)>
<14, (15, 0, 11)>
<26, (13, -, -)>
<16, (27, 21, 18)>
<21, (2, 3, 0)>
<9, (14, 12, -)>
<4, (6, 25, -)>
<12, (3, 22, 9)>
<19, (22, 7, 24)>
<11, (15, 14, 5)>
<5, (21, 11, 10)>
<7, (6, 19, 10)>
<24, (27, 19, 20)>
<10, (8, 28, 16)>
<25, (22, 23, 4)>
<18, (16, 20, -)>
<20, (24, 18, -)>
<17, (15, -, -)>

Based on the listed 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
