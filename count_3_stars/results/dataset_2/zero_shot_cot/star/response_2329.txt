The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 17) (22, 8) (9, 26) (9, 19) (9, 11) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 10) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 24) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 8) (0, 20) (0, 4) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 19) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 5) (8, 22) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 14) (21, 28) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 25) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 12) (4, 0) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 4) (18, 14) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 23) (5, 13) (5, 15) (7, 20) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 11) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 3) (17, 22) (17, 2) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 19) (16, 21) (16, 7) (12, 28) (12, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 27) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 27) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 25) (11, 12) (27, 3) (27, 23) (1, 28) (24, 22) (24, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by looking at each node as a potential central node and analyzing their connections:

1. Node 0: (0, 20), (0, 4) - Does not form a 3-star.
2. Node 1: (1, 28) - Does not form a 3-star.
3. Node 2: (2, 29), (2, 8), (2, 6), (2, 24), (2, 17) - Forms a 3-star: <2, (29, 8, 24)>
4. Node 3: (3, 13), (3, 9), (3, 10), (3, 27) - Does not form a 3-star.
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 18), (4, 23) - Does not form a 3-star.
6. Node 5: (5, 13), (5, 15) - Does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6: (6, 13), (6, 2), (6, 23) - Does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 7: (7, 20), (7, 25), (7, 16) - Does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 8: (8, 22), (8, 2), (8, 29), (8, 14) - Forms a 3-star: <8, (22, 2, 29)>
10. Node 9: (9, 26), (9, 19), (9, 11), (9, 3) - Does not form a 3-star.
11. Node 10: (10, 26), (10, 15), (10, 3) - Does not form a 3-star.
12. Node 11: (11, 9), (11, 21), (11, 25), (11, 12) - Forms a 3-star: <11, (9, 21, 25)>
13. Node 12: (12, 28), (12, 11) - Does not form a 3-star.
14. Node 13: (13, 22), (13, 5), (13, 3), (13, 6) - Forms a 3-star: <13, (22, 5, 3)>
15. Node 14: (14, 8), (14, 18), (14, 19) - Does not form a 3-star.
16. Node 15: (15, 20), (15, 10), (15, 19), (15, 5) - Does not form a 3-star.
17. Node 16: (16, 21), (16, 7) - Does not form a 3-star.
18. Node 17: (17, 22), (17, 2) - Does not form a 3-star.
19. Node 18: (18, 4), (18, 14) - Does not form a 3-star.
20. Node 19: (19, 9), (19, 20), (19, 15), (19, 14) - Does not form a 3-star.
21. Node 20: (20, 0), (20, 15), (20, 7), (20, 19) - Does not form a 3-star.
22. Node 21: (21, 28), (21, 16), (21, 11), (21, 25) - Does not form a 3-star.
23. Node 22: (22, 13), (22, 24), (22, 17), (22, 8) - Forms a 3-star: <22, (13, 24, 17)>
24. Node 23: (23, 4), (23, 6), (23, 27) - Does not form a 3-star.
25. Node 24: (24, 22), (24, 2) - Does not form a 3-star.
26. Node 25: (25, 21), (25, 7), (25, 11) - Does not form a 3-star.
27. Node 26: (26, 9), (26, 10) - Does not form a 3-star.
28. Node 27: (27, 3), (27, 23) - Does not form a 3-star.
29. Node 28: (28, 21), (28, 1), (28, 12) - Does not form a 3-star.
30. Node 29: (29, 2), (29, 8) - Does not form a 3-star.

From the analysis above, we found two unique 3-stars in the given graph:
- <2, (29, 8, 24)>
- <13, (22, 5, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
