Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 

The possible 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 11)>
<1, (5, 6, 13)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 12)>
<4, (2, 6, 12)>
<6, (1, 6, 10)>
<7, (2, 7, 10)>
<8, (0, 1, 14)>
<11, (0, 7, 14)>
<12, (3, 6, 7)>

After listing the unique 3-stars found, we count a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
