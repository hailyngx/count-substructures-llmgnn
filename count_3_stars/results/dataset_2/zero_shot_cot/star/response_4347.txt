Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 14)>
<1, (5, 9, 11)>
<2, (6, 11, 14)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (8, 10, 13)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 8, 13)>
<9, (0, 1, 10)>
<10, (4, 8, 12)>
<11, (1, 5, 2)>
<12, (0, 10, 12)>
<13, (8, 9, 12)>
<14, (0, 2, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph [14].
