Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes with edges. 

1. From the given edges, we can see that the central node must have degree 3 in order to form a 3-star.
2. For each node with degree 3, we can then find the three connected nodes to determine the 3-star.

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 6 is a central node of a 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 10)>
- Node 9 is a central node of a 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 10)>
- Node 1 is a central node of a 3-star: <1, (6, 11, 2)>
- Node 3 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 10 is a central node of a 3-star: <10, (6, 9, 11)>
- Node 11 is a central node of a 3-star: <11, (6, 1, 10)>
- Node 8 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 13 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 7 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 12 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 0 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 14 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 5 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 2 is not a central node of any 3-star.
- Node 4 is not a central node of any 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2. 
So, the final answer is: [2]
