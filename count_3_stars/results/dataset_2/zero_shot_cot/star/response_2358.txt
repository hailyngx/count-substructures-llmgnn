Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 
Nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, and 13 satisfy this condition.

Next, for each of these identified nodes, we need to check if they are part of a 3-star structure by verifying if the nodes they are connected to form a 3-star.

Nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, and 13 are connected to the following nodes respectively:
5: 9, 6, 2, 7
9: 5, 4, 1, 13
4: 9, 7, 3
7: 5, 4, 11, 3, 1
1: 9, 7, 3, 14
3: 4, 7, 1, 13, 12
6: 5, 8, 11, 0
8: 14, 10, 11, 6
10: 8, 13, 2, 14
11: 7, 8, 6, 13, 12
14: 1, 8, 10, 2
13: 9, 3, 10, 11, 12

Counting the number of 3-stars, we get:
[<1, (9, 7, 14)>, <3, (4, 7, 13)>, <8, (6, 10, 14)>]
