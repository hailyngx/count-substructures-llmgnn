Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 21) (3, 0) (6, 25) (6, 19) (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 16) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 17) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 8) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 20) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 23) (29, 24) (29, 11) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 14) (28, 26) (28, 23) (28, 12) (28, 17) (21, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 4) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 14) (11, 19) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (5, 25) (5, 16) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 4) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 4) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 25) (16, 9) (16, 5) (27, 18) (4, 24) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (20, 2) (20, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (3, 17, 4)>
2. <1, (2, 7, 19)>
3. <2, (1, 24, 29)>
4. <3, (0, 22, 21)>
5. <4, (0, 24, 17)>
6. <5, (25, 16, 6)>
7. <6, (25, 19, 0)>
8. <7, (1, 8, 12)>
9. <8, (7, 25, 10)>
10. <9, (25, 26, 16)>
11. <10, (8, 1, 26)>
12. <11, (26, 14, 29)>
13. <12, (7, 28, 14)>
14. <13, (24, 29, 11)>
15. <14, (12, 11, 29)>
16. <16, (25, 9, 5)>
17. <17, (18, 4, 28)>
18. <18, (22, 27, 17)>
19. <19, (6, 11, 20)>
20. <20, (2, 19, 24)>
21. <21, (3, 22, 0)>
22. <22, (18, 23, 3)>
23. <23, (29, 28, 22)>
24. <24, (13, 4, 2)>
25. <25, (6, 5, 9)>
26. <26, (9, 8, 28)>
27. <27, (18, 17, 0)>
28. <28, (26, 23, 12)>
29. <29, (2, 13, 11)>

There are a total of 29 unique 3-stars in the graph, which can be seen by counting the unique central nodes with their corresponding sets of leaves. Therefore, the final answer is [29].
