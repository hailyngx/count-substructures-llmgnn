Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 11) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 11) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 10) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 5) (16, 14) (16, 13) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 5) (18, 0) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 11) (11, 15) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (4, 15, 17)>
<15, (3, 13, 19)>
<17, (1, 11, 19)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 17)>
<5, (4, 8, 19)>
<19, (5, 15, 17)>
<16, (13, 14, 15)>
<8, (5, 6, 0)>
<2, (1, 9, 12)>
<0, (2, 8, 18)>
<13, (11, 15, 16)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [13]
