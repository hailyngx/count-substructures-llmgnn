Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 10) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 1) (12, 17) (11, 3) (11, 19) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are part of 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 15, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 13, and 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 14, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 9, and there are no other edges connected to it.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 10.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 8, and 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 2, 19, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 16.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 18, and 1.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 13, and 16.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 19, and there are no other edges connected to it.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 17, 1, and 10.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 19, 0, and 2.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 17, 10, and 8.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 13, 16, and 12.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 9 and 4.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 15, 14, 6, and 11.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:

- There are 3-stars: <0, (14, 15, 1)>, <1, (9, 6, 0)>, <6, (5, 2, 19)>, <9, (3, 5, 1)>, <14, (17, 19, 0)>, <16, (17, 10, 8)>, <17, (14, 13, 16)>, and <19, (15, 14, 6)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
