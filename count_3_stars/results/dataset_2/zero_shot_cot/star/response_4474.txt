Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (7, 9) (7, 0) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 10) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 8) (3, 13) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (8, 18) (8, 16) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

- From node 5: <5, (9, 13, 4)>
- From node 9: <9, (5, 15, 17)>
- From node 4: <4, (5, 18, -)>
- From node 18: <18, (4, 15, 17)>
- From node 13: <13, (5, 17, 2)>
- From node 7: <7, (9, 0, -)>
- From node 1: <1, (9, 6, 14)>
- From node 15: <15, (9, 18, 6)>
- From node 17: <17, (9, 18, 13)>
- From node 6: <6, (1, 15, 2)>
- From node 12: <12, (18, 6, 16)>
- From node 16: <16, (10, 6, 12)>
- From node 18: <18, (12, 8, -)>
- From node 2: <2, (13, 6, 11)>
- From node 14: <14, (1, 10, 11)>
- From node 8: <8, (18, 16, -)>
- From node 19: <19, (12, -,-)>
- From node 10: <10, (16, 14, -)>
- From node 11: <11, (14, 2, -)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph results in [17].
