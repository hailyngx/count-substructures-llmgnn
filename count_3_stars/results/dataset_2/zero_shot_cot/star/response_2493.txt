Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
There are 3-stars centered at nodes 5, 6, 15, 16, 17, 18,  and 26.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (7, 12, 15)>
<6, (9, 14, 15)>
<15, (5, 6, 17)>
<16, (18, 26, 28)>
<17, (6, 15, 21)>
<18, (13, 20, 23)>
<26, (3, 14, 15)>
