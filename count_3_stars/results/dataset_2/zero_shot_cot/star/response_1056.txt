Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that each node is connected to:
0: 9, 1, 6
1: 9, 4, 2, 0
2: 9, 7, 1, 6
3: 5, 4, 8, 6
4: 5, 9, 7, 3, 1, 6
5: 9, 4, 3
6: 4, 7, 2, 8, 0, 3
7: 4, 6, 2
8: 6, 3
9: 5, 4, 2, 1, 0

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (9, 1, 6)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<8, (6, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 2, 1)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in total. So, the final answer is [10].
