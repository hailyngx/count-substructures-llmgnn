Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a node is the center connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes and their connections to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 7) -> <0, (4, 5, 2)>
- Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2) -> <1, (6, 3, 2)>
- Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 0), (2, 7) -> <2, (9, 1, 8)> , <2, (1, 8, 0)>, <2, (8, 0, 7)>
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 7) -> <3, (9, 1, 7)>
- Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 0) -> <4, (6, 9, 8)>, <4, (6, 9, 0)>
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7) -> <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 4) -> <6, (5, 1, 7)>
- Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 2), (7, 0) -> <7, (6, 3, 5)> , <7, (3, 5, 2)>, <7, (3, 2, 0)>
- Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5) -> <8, (9, 4, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 5)>
- Node 9: (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3) -> <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (8, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we have 12 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
