Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. Node 5: (5, 9, 12), (5, 9, 3), (5, 12, 6), (5, 3, 1), (5, 14, 6)
2. Node 9: (9, 6, 14), (9, 1, 3), (9, 0, 8)
3. Node 6: (6, 9, 14), (6, 12, 13)
4. Node 1: (1, 9, 3), (1, 3, 8), (1, 13, 8)
5. Node 3: (3, 5, 1), (3, 11, 7)
6. Node 10: (10, 11, 12), (10, 12, 4)
7. Node 11: (11, 3, 7), (11, 12, 10)
8. Node 8: (8, 1, 13), (8, 4, 13), (8, 0, 2)
9. Node 13: (13, 6, 1), (13, 8, 4)
10. Node 4: (4, 5, 10), (4, 8, 13)
11. Node 7: (7, 3, 11), (7, 11, 14)
12. Node 12: (12, 5, 6), (12, 10, 11)
13. Node 0: (0, 9, 8), (0, 8, 2)
14. Node 14: (14, 5, 6), (14, 7, 2)

Counting the unique 3-stars we identified in the graph gives us a total of <5, (9, 12, 6)>, <9, (6, 14, 9)>, <9, (1, 9, 3)>, <6, (14, 6, 9)>, <1, (9, 3, 1)>, <3, (5, 1, 3)>, <10, (12, 11, 10)>, <8, (1, 8, 13)>, <13, (8, 4, 13)>, <4, (5, 10, 4)>, <7, (11, 7, 14)>, <12, (5, 6, 12)>, <0, (8, 0, 9)>, and <14, (2, 6, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
