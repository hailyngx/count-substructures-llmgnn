Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 27) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 19) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 1) (4, 18) (4, 15) (18, 13) (18, 4) (18, 25) (26, 22) (26, 10) (24, 0) (24, 7) (6, 21) (6, 25) (6, 12) (21, 13) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 14) (28, 17) (28, 25) (16, 21) (16, 25) (2, 21) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 23) (12, 6) (12, 2) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 20) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 2) (7, 14) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 8) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 9) (15, 4) (15, 23) (15, 8) (23, 2) (23, 15) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) (27, 22) (27, 19) (5, 10) (5, 20) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 27) (25, 18) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 16) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 15) (20, 10) (20, 5) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors, forming potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
1. Node 13 is connected to 22, 21, and 18.
2. Node 14 is connected to 17, 28, and 29.
3. Node 17 is connected to 14, 29, and 28.
4. Node 21 is connected to 13, 6, and 16.
5. Node 22 is connected to 13, 26, and 27.
6. Node 25 is connected to 18, 6, and 28.

Next, we will count the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <13, (22, 21, 18)>
2. <14, (17, 28, 29)>
3. <17, (14, 28, 29)>
4. <21, (13, 6, 16)>
5. <22, (13, 26, 27)>
6. <25, (18, 6, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
