Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. A 3-star will have the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 8, 12)>
<9, (5, 8, 14)>
<6, (14, 2, 4)>
<1, (11, 12, 7)>
<3, (7, 13, 0)>
<10, (11, 12, 7)>
<11, (1, 10, 14)>
<8, (5, 9, 11)>
<13, (5, 8, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<14, (9, 6, 11)>
<7, (1, 3, 10)>
<2, (5, 6, 13)>
<12, (5, 1, 10)>
<4, (6, 14, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
