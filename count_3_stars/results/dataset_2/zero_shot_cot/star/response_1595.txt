Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 25) (1, 24) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 15) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (0, 10) (0, 8) (27, 12) (27, 9) (12, 4) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 23) (20, 3) (26, 28) (26, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 0) (8, 24) (8, 15) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 10) (22, 15) (29, 19) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 28) (10, 3) (16, 2) (16, 24) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 16) (3, 20) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 11) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 19) (19, 29) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 23) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 6) (9, 7) (9, 27) (9, 3) (23, 12) (23, 17) (23, 19) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 22) (15, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars where the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the nodes that have exactly three connections:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 16
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 27, and 10
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 28, 5, and 10
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 26, 2, and 11
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 16
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 20, 10, and 17
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 29, 3, and 25
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 17
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 12, 17, and 19
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 28, 25, and 15
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 21, 2, and 8
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 18, and 15

Now let's identify the unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 12, 2)>
<7, (4, 14, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 16)>
<12, (4, 27, 10)>
<26, (28, 5, 10)>
<5, (26, 2, 11)>
<24, (1, 8, 16)>
<3, (20, 10, 17)>
<19, (29, 3, 25)>
<11, (4, 5, 17)>
<23, (12, 17, 19)>
<21, (28, 25, 15)>
<15, (21, 2, 8)>
<13, (7, 18, 15)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
