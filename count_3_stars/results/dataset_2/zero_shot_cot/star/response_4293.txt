Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can do this by examining each node and checking if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Here are the 3-star graphs found in the given graph:

[<5, (6, 1, 4)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <1, (5, 3, 6)>, <3, (9, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 1, 6)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <2, (9, 7, 3)>, <0, (5, 9, 4)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9].
