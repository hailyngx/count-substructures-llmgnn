Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify which nodes can be central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a central node in a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with degree 3.

The possible central nodes are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and 5.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by listing the unique combinations of a central node and its adjacent nodes:

<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
<8, (7, 9, 1)>
<5, (4, 1, 2)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
