Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 14) (0, 27) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 13) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 2) (7, 20) (7, 14) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 5) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 21) (18, 1) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 16) (13, 27) (13, 8) (13, 11) (1, 18) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 6) (26, 12) (9, 18) (9, 19) (22, 3) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 23) (16, 4) (16, 8) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 28) (23, 17) (23, 18) (23, 19) (28, 4) (28, 17) (28, 20) (28, 5) (24, 14) (24, 10) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 10) (10, 27) (10, 24) (10, 6) (10, 12) (12, 0) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 21) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 25) (5, 29) (25, 19) (25, 5) (25, 21) (29, 15) (29, 5) (21, 18) (21, 12) (21, 25) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three edges each, as these nodes could potentially form the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with three edges each:
- Node 3
- Node 15
- Node 27
- Node 4
- Node 7
- Node 17
- Node 18
- Node 8
- Node 1
- Node 26
- Node 9
- Node 11
- Node 2
- Node 19
- Node 16
- Node 20
- Node 23
- Node 28
- Node 6
- Node 10
- Node 12
- Node 5
- Node 25
- Node 21
- Node 14

Now, let's look for 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the center and checking if they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

<3, (15, 11, 22)>
<27, (0, 10, 13)>
<4, (28, 16, 2)>
<7, (20, 14, 2)>
<17, (18, 28, 23)>
<18, (17, 9, 23)>
<8, (13, 20, 16)>
<1, (18, 26, 21)>
<26, (1, 6, 12)>
<9, (18, 19, 23)>
<11, (3, 13, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 11)>
<19, (9, 25, 23)>
<16, (4, 8, 20)>
<20, (7, 8, 28)>
<23, (17, 18, 19)>
<28, (4, 17, 20)>
<6, (3, 26, 10)>
<10, (27, 24, 6)>
<12, (0, 26, 21)>
<5, (17, 28, 25)>
<25, (19, 5, 21)>
<21, (18, 12, 25)>
<14, (15, 7, 24)>

Considering all the unique 3-stars listed, there are [24] 3-stars in the given graph.
