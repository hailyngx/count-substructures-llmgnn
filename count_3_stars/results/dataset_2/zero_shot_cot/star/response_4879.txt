Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10) (6, 12) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected in the pattern of a 3-star.

Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars:
- 3-stars containing node 4: <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 10)>, <4, (9, 7, 10)>, <4, (2, 8, 10)>
- 3-stars containing node 7: <7, (4, 9, 12)>, <7, (12, 13, 9)>, <7, (2, 12, 13)>
- 3-stars containing node 8: <8, (4, 0, 5)>
- 3-stars containing node 9: <9, (4, 7, 10)>, <9, (4, 0, 10)>
- 3-stars containing node 12: <12, (7, 13, 2)>, <12, (0, 1, 6)>, <12, (0, 5, 6)>
- 3-stars containing node 10: <10, (4, 2, 13)>, <10, (9, 7, 14)>, <10, (1, 2, 14)>, <10, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, we have found a total of 12 unique 3-stars in this graph.
