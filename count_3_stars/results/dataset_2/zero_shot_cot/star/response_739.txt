Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 4) (13, 29) (22, 18) (22, 10) (15, 5) (15, 21) (27, 14) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 6) (6, 26) (6, 18) (6, 19) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 28) (18, 25) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 8) (20, 23) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 5) (29, 13) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 23) (19, 6) (19, 23) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 10) (17, 28) (17, 5) (8, 12) (8, 14) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 19) (23, 3) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 16) (2, 21) (2, 25) (0, 24) (0, 16) (0, 25) (0, 5) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 14) (16, 0) (21, 13) (21, 15) (21, 2) (21, 11) (25, 18) (25, 2) (25, 0) (25, 1) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 25) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 3) (5, 15) (5, 28) (5, 17) (5, 0) (11, 18) (11, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three edges to determine the potential central nodes:

- Node 4: (13, 4), (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 29) (has 4 edges)
- Node 5: (15, 5), (28, 5), (0, 5), (5, 17) (has 4 edges)
- Node 6: (26, 6), (6, 18), (6, 19) (has 3 edges)
- Node 14: (27, 14), (26, 14), (14, 8), (14, 16) (has 4 edges)
- Node 18: (22, 18), (6, 18), (18, 11), (18, 28), (18, 25) (has 5 edges)
- Node 21: (13, 21), (15, 21), (2, 21), (21, 11) (has 4 edges)
- Node 24: (26, 24), (24, 16), (24, 0), (24, 10) (has 4 edges)
- Node 28: (18, 28), (28, 29), (28, 17), (28, 5) (has 4 edges)
- Node 29: (13, 29), (4, 29), (29, 28), (29, 23) (has 4 edges)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The number of 3-star graphs is [3].

Unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (13, 7, 12)>
<5, (15, 28, 17)>
<24, (26, 16, 10)>
