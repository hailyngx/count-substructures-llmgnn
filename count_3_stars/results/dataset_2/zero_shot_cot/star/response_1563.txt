Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 5) (0, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 18) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is at the center of a star with three other nodes connected to it. Let's identify all such unique 3-stars:

<1, (6, 8, 18)>
<2, (4, 11, 14)>
<3, (10, 15, 16)>
<4, (2, 10, 16)>
<5, (0, 7, 11)>
<6, (1, 12, 18)>
<7, (1, 5, 13)>
<8, (1, 13, 14)>
<9, (6, 7, 9)>
<12, (5, 6, 12)>
<13, (7, 8, 15)>
<14, (2, 8, 16)>
<15, (3, 8, 13)>
<16, (3, 4, 14)>
<18, (1, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we have a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
