Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 7) (3, 27) (3, 24) (3, 10) (7, 27) (7, 17) (12, 15) (6, 21) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 2) (4, 27) (4, 28) (4, 20) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 20) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 0) (26, 17) (1, 9) (1, 22) (2, 21) (2, 26) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 20) (28, 4) (28, 13) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (29, 6) (29, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 23) (5, 25) (5, 22) (23, 5) (23, 0) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 17) (13, 21) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 11) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 25) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 24) (25, 0) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 22) (18, 29) (18, 24) (18, 10) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (0, 26) (0, 23) (0, 25) (20, 4) (20, 14) (20, 16) (20, 22) 

Response:
From the given information, the graph consists of several triangles and paths, and we are interested in finding the 3-stars within this graph. 

To identify the 3-stars, we need to look for nodes with exactly three edges. These nodes will be the centers of our 3-stars, with the other nodes connected to them being the leaves.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 5 is a center connected to nodes 16, 22, and 23. <5, (16, 22, 23)>
2. Node 6 is a center connected to nodes 21, 17, and 29. <6, (21, 17, 29)>
3. Node 9 is a center connected to nodes 1, 13, and 25. <9, (1, 13, 25)>
4. Node 13 is a center connected to nodes 9, 11, and 28. <13, (9, 11, 28)>
5. Node 17 is a center connected to nodes 7, 6, and 26. <17, (7, 6, 26)>
6. Node 20 is a center connected to nodes 4, 14, and 16. <20, (4, 14, 16)>
7. Node 22 is a center connected to nodes 1, 16, and 5. <22, (1, 16, 5)>
8. Node 25 is a center connected to nodes 9, 0, and 24. <25, (9, 0, 24)>
9. Node 26 is a center connected to nodes 2, 0, and 17. <26, (2, 0, 17)>
10. Node 29 is a center connected to nodes 6, 18, and 29. <29, (6, 18, 29)>

Now, count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
