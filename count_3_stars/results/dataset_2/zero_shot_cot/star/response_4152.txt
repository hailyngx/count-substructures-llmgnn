Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 2) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (12, 15) (12, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges, as these nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 1, 6, 9, 13

Next, we will examine each of these nodes to see if they are at the center of a 3-star. 

For node 0:
Edges: (0, 8), (0, 3), (0, 6)
This forms a 3-star with central node 0 and leaves 8, 3, and 6. 

For node 1:
Edges: (1, 10), (1, 15), (1, 16)
This forms a 3-star with central node 1 and leaves 10, 15, and 16. 

For node 6:
Edges: (6, 19), (6, 0), (6, 14)
This forms a 3-star with central node 6 and leaves 19, 0, and 14. 

For node 9:
Edges: (9, 19), (9, 14), (9, 16)
This forms a 3-star with central node 9 and leaves 19, 14, and 16. 

For node 13:
Edges: (13, 2), (13, 2), (13, 2)
This forms a 3-star with central node 13 and leaves 2, 2, and 2. 

After examining all nodes with degree 3, we find that the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (8, 3, 6)>, <1, (10, 15, 16)>, <6, (19, 0, 14)>, <9, (19, 14, 16)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
