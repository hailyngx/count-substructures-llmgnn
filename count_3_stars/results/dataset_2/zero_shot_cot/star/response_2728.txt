Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the given set of edges. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <4, (8, 9, 10)>
2. <8, (4, 2, 5)>
3. <2, (8, 10, 13)>
4. <3, (7, 0, 10)>
5. <11, (1, 13, 6)>
6. <0, (7, 9, 13)>
7. <7, (3, 0, 5)>
8. <1, (4, 11, 14)>
9. <6, (4, 11, 13)>
10. <10, (4, 2, 7)>
11. <14, (1, 12, 13)>
12. <5, (8, 7, 12)>
13. <9, (4, 0, 10)>
14. <12, (11, 6, 14)>
15. <13, (2, 11, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
