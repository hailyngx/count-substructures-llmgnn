Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 17) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 16) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 14) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 18) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify all nodes connecting to each node:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 11, 15, 18.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 13, 16.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 7, 15, 17.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 6, 10, 11, 17.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 7.
- Node 5: Connected to node 1.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 8, 16.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, 19.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 6, 7, 10.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 17.
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 3, 8, 18.
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 0, 3, 19.
- Node 12: Connected to node 14.
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 1, 19.
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 12, 15, 19.
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 2, 0, 14.
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 6, 1, 18.
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 9, 3, 2, 18.
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 10, 17, 0, 16.
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 7, 13, 11, 14.

2. For each node, identify 3-stars using it as the center:
<0, (9, 15, 18)>
<1, (7, 13, 16)>
<2, (7, 15, 17)>
<3, (6, 10, 18)>
<4, (7)>
<5, (1)>
<6, (3, 8, 16)>
<7, (2, 8, 19)>
<8, (6, 7, 10)>
<9, (0, 17, 19)>
<10, (3, 8, 18)>
<11, (0, 3, 19)>
<12, (14)>
<13, (1, 19)>
<14, (12, 15, 19)>
<15, (2, 14, 0)>
<16, (6, 1, 18)>
<17, (9, 3, 18)>
<18, (10, 17, 0)>
<19, (7, 13, 14)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
[20]
