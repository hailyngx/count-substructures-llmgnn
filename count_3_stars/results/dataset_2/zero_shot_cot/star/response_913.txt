Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 12) (1, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (11, 6, 7)>
<1, (12, 4, 9)>
<2, (8, 3, 12)>
<3, (12, 2, 4)>
<4, (6, 1, 9)>
<5, (8, 6, 12)>
<6, (0, 8, 4)>
<7, (10, 9, 11)>
<8, (12, 2, 5)>
<9, (4, 12, 14)>
<10, (7, 11, 9)>
<11, (0, 13, 14)>
<12, (5, 2, 8)>
<13, (11, 4, 14)>
<14, (11, 13, 9)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [14]
