- Node 3 has neighbors 15, 20, and 21.
- Node 4 has neighbors 1, 11, and 25.
- Node 5 has neighbors 1, 22, and 27.
- Node 6 has neighbors 2, 10, and 26.
- Node 7 has neighbors 2, 9, and 17.
- Node 8 has neighbors 27.
- Node 9 has neighbors 7, 17, and 22.
- Node 10 has neighbors 2, 6, and 16.
- Node 11 has neighbors 4, 24, and 25.
- Node 12 has neighbors 18, 23.
- Node 13 has neighbors 20, 24.
- Node 14 has neighbors 0, 16, 21.
- Node 15 has neighbors 3.
- Node 16 has neighbors 10, 14, 26.
- Node 17 has neighbors 7, 9, 18.
- Node 18 has neighbors 10, 12, 17.
- Node 19 has neighbors 0, 24, 26.
- Node 20 has neighbors 13, 21.
- Node 21 has neighbors 14, 20, 27.
- Node 22 has neighbors 5, 9, 25.
- Node 23 has neighbors 0, 12, 25, 28.
- Node 24 has neighbors 11, 13, 19.
- Node 25 has neighbors 1, 4, 11, 22, 23.
- Node 26 has neighbors 6, 16, 19.
- Node 27 has neighbors 5, 8, 21, 29.
- Node 28 has neighbors 1, 23, 27.
- Node 29 has neighbors 16, 27.

Now, list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (14, 19, 23)>
<1, (4, 5, 25)>
<2, (6, 7, 10)>
<3, (15, 20, 21)>
<4, (1, 11, 25)>
<5, (1, 22, 27)>
<6, (2, 10, 26)>
<7, (2, 9, 17)>
<9, (7, 17, 22)>
<10, (2, 6, 16)>
<11, (4, 24, 25)>
<14, (0, 16, 21)>
<16, (10, 14, 26)>
<17, (7, 9, 18)>
<18, (10, 12, 17)>
<19, (0, 24, 26)>
<20, (13, 21)>
<21, (14, 20, 27)>
<22, (5, 9, 25)>
<23, (0, 12, 25)>
<24, (11, 13, 19)>
<25, (1, 4, 11)>
<26, (6, 16, 19)>
<27, (5, 21, 29)>
<28, (1, 23, 27)>
<29, (16, 27)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
