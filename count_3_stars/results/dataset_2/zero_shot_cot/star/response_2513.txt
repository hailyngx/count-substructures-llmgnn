Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 24) (3, 25) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 11) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 4) (21, 18) (21, 29) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 9) (18, 21) (18, 2) (18, 17) (20, 15) (20, 3) (20, 17) (20, 24) (6, 25) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 19) (17, 18) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 22) (16, 17) (16, 24) (16, 8) (8, 25) (8, 16) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (11, 25) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 29) (23, 5) (23, 1) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 29) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 14) (26, 10) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 16) (24, 19) (29, 7) (29, 21) (29, 11) (29, 10) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 13) (5, 11) (5, 23) (14, 22) (12, 15) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 1) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 1) (4, 21) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming possible 3-star structures.

- Node 15 is connected to 4 other nodes {20, 13, 12, 24}.
- Node 25 is connected to 5 other nodes {3, 13, 6, 8, 11}.
- Node 21 is connected to 4 other nodes {10, 4, 18, 29}.
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes {18, 22, 9}.
- Node 20 is connected to 4 other nodes {15, 3, 17, 24}.
- Node 6 is connected to 2 other nodes {25, 28}.
- Node 28 is connected to 2 other nodes {6, 19}.
- Node 17 is connected to 5 other nodes {18, 20, 16, 0, 22}.
- Node 16 is connected to 3 other nodes {17, 24, 8}.
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes {25, 16, 9}.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 other nodes {2, 8, 1, 0}.
- Node 11 is connected to 4 other nodes {25, 19, 5, 29}.
- Node 10 is connected to 3 other nodes {21, 26, 29}.
- Node 22 is connected to 3 other nodes {2, 17, 14}.
- Node 24 is connected to 4 other nodes {15, 20, 16, 19}.
- Node 29 is connected to 4 other nodes {7, 21, 11, 10}.
- Node 19 is connected to 5 other nodes {7, 28, 11, 24, 13}.
- Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes {7, 9, 13, 0, 23}.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

- <15, (20, 24, 13)>
- <25, (3, 8, 11)>
- <21, (10, 4, 29)>
- <2, (18, 22, 9)>
- <20, (3, 17, 24)>
- <17, (18, 20, 22)>
- <16, (24, 8, 17)>
- <8, (25, 9, 16)>
- <9, (2, 8, 1)>
- <11, (25, 19, 5)>
- <10, (21, 26, 29)>
- <22, (2, 17, 14)>
- <24, (15, 20, 16)>
- <29, (7, 21, 11)>
- <19, (7, 28, 13)>
- <1, (7, 9, 13)>

Therefore, there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
