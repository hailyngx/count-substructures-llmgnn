Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 6, as these could be the leaves in a 3-star graph with center at node 6. 
   
The nodes directly connected to node 6 are: 9, 5, 1, 4, 8. 

Now, for each of these potential centers (9, 5, 1, 4, 8), let's check if they are connected to exactly three other nodes. If they are, then we have a 3-star graph.
   
- For center at node 9: 
    - Nodes directly connected to 9 are: 6, 0. Node 9 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
   
- For center at node 5: 
    - Nodes directly connected to 5 are: 6, 3, 8, 2, 0, 7. Node 5 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
   
- For center at node 1: 
    - Nodes directly connected to 1 are: 6, 3, 4, 8. Node 1 is connected to exactly three other nodes: 3, 4, 8. 
   
- For center at node 4: 
    - Nodes directly connected to 4 are: 6, 1, 8, 0. Node 4 is connected to exactly three other nodes: 1, 8, 0. 
   
- For center at node 8: 
    - Nodes directly connected to 8 are: 6, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7. Node 8 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
   
Hence, we found two unique 3-star graphs: 
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 0, 6)>
   
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
