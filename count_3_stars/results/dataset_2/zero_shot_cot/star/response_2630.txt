Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. These will be nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Considering the given graph, the central nodes are: 5, 10, 11, 3, and 2.

Next, let's identify the leaves connected to each central node to determine the 3-stars. 

For central node 5:
- Leaves: 6, 1, 0
<5, (6, 1, 0)>

For central node 10:
- Leaves: 6, 11, 14
<10, (6, 11, 14)>

For central node 11:
- Leaves: 6, 10, 3
<11, (6, 10, 3)>
<11, (6, 13, 12)>

For central node 3:
- Leaves: 11, 13, 2
<3, (11, 13, 2)>
<3, (13, 6, 12)>
<3, (13, 2, 14)>
<3, (11, 2, 0)>

For central node 2:
- Leaves: 6, 10, 0
<2, (6, 10, 0)>
<2, (10, 3, 14)>
<2, (10, 14, 7)>
<2, (3, 0, 8)>
<2, (14, 1, 7)>
<2, (14, 13, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
