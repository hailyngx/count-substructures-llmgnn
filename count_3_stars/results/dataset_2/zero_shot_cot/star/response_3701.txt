Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 9. (<5, (2, 4, 9)>)
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6. (<9, (2, 5, 6)>)
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 9. (<6, (1, 2, 9)>)
4. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6. (<1, (3, 4, 6)>)
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 6. (<3, (1, 4, 6)>)
6. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5. (<4, (1, 3, 5)>)
7. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 6. (<7, (2, 3, 6)>)
8. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 1. (<8, (0, 4, 1)>)
9. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 8. (<0, (2, 5, 8)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
