Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (17, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 7) (8, 15) (12, 9) (12, 19) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 5) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 is a central node with leaves 9, 7, and 16. <4, (9, 7, 16)>
2. Node 7 is a central node with leaves 4, 2, and 15. <7, (4, 2, 15)>
3. Node 10 is a central node with leaves 1, 11, and 17. <10, (1, 11, 17)>
4. Node 18 is a central node with leaves 9, 10, and 19. <18, (9, 10, 19)>
5. Node 16 is a central node with leaves 4, 1, and 3. <16, (4, 1, 3)>
6. Node 13 is a central node with leaves 18, 0, and 16. <13, (18, 0, 16)>
7. Node 15 is a central node with leaves 7, 2, and 5. <15, (7, 2, 5)>

All other nodes do not form 3-stars in this graph.

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
