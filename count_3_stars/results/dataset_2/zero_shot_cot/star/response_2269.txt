Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 10) (9, 23) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 19) (3, 22) (25, 8) (25, 21) (25, 22) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 27) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 2) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 24) (8, 21) (15, 1) (20, 17) (0, 14) (0, 21) (19, 26) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 28) (22, 3) (22, 25) (22, 6) (22, 28) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 28) (11, 26) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 2) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 24) (28, 19) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 18) (24, 8) (24, 23) (24, 18) (21, 25) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 12) (12, 21) (6, 7) (6, 22) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 18) (29, 10) (18, 5) (18, 28) (18, 24) (18, 29) (10, 9) (10, 29) (10, 27) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 27) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 16) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <11, (1, 4, 26)>
2. <13, (2, 16, 29)>
3. <14, (0, 17, 27)>
4. <17, (2, 14, 20)>
5. <19, (1, 5, 28)>
6. <21, (0, 8, 25)>
7. <22, (3, 6, 25)>
8. <23, (9, 11, 24)>
9. <26, (8, 19, 29)>
10. <28, (13, 18, 22)>
11. <29, (16, 18, 26)>

Therefore, there are [11] unique 3-stars in the graph.
