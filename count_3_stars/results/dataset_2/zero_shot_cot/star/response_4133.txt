Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 13) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 13) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 
A 3-star is formed when a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<8, (3, 13, 10)>
<13, (9, 8, 14)>
<10, (1, 8, 11)>
<11, (1, 10, 12)>
<4, (6, 9, 8)>
<7, (6, 3, 4)>
<5, (6, 3, 13)>
<0, (9, 8, 7)>
<14, (13, 12)>
<12, (7, 10, 14)>
<2, (9, 1, 10)>

Counting all these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [15] 3-stars.
