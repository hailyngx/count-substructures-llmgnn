Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 0) (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 15) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 18) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 18) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 15) (23, 4) (0, 22) (0, 1) (20, 27) (20, 4) (24, 26) (24, 12) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 19) (26, 24) (17, 8) (17, 27) (25, 2) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 3) (3, 9) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 10) (27, 29) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 19) (27, 6) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 15) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 27) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 14) (6, 13) (6, 27) (6, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (12, 1) (12, 24) (12, 10) (18, 29) (18, 7) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify nodes that are connected in the form of a star. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's start by listing out the 3-stars present in the graph:

<13, (22, 15, 14)>
<22, (13, 23, 14)>
<1, (21, 11, 0)>
<21, (1, 7, 15)>
<2, (29, 19, 9)>
<29, (2, 27, 5)>
<7, (21, 19, 18)>
<23, (22, 11, 15)>
<0, (22, 1, 20)>
<12, (1, 24, 10)>
<11, (1, 23, 28)>
<8, (1, 17, 15)>
<9, (2, 16, 3)>
<5, (22, 29, 10)>
<27, (29, 20, 17)>
<14, (13, 22, 15)>
<19, (2, 7, 28)>
<15, (13, 21, 23)>
<6, (13, 27, 10)>
<10, (5, 6, 12)>
<16, (9, 4)>
<18, (7, 29)>
<4, (23, 20, 16)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars identified, we get a total of [24] 3-stars in the given graph.
