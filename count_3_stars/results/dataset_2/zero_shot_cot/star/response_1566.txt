Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

<0, (1, 11, 14)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 12)>
<4, (0, 10, 14)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (5, 7, 13)>
<7, (3, 6, 10)>
<8, (1, 9, 10)>
<9, (8, 12, 7)>
<10, (4, 8, 13)>
<11, (0, 6, 14)>
<12, (9, 3, 8)>
<13, (1, 6, 10)>
<14, (0, 4, 11)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
