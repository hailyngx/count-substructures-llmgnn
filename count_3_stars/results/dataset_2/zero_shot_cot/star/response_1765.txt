Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing the edges incident to each node:
Node 0: (6, 0), (13, 0), (8, 0)
Node 1: (6, 1), (4, 1), (14, 1), (3, 1)
Node 2: (6, 2), (10, 2), (3, 2), (7, 2)
Node 3: (1, 3), (7, 3), (2, 3), (8, 3)
Node 4: (5, 4), (1, 4), (11, 4)
Node 5: (4, 5), (9, 5), (13, 5)
Node 6: (1, 6), (14, 6), (0, 6), (2, 6), (8, 6)
Node 7: (3, 7), (11, 7), (12, 7), (2, 7), (13, 7)
Node 8: (9, 8), (6, 8), (3, 8), (0, 8)
Node 9: (5, 9), (8, 9), (14, 9)
Node 10: (11, 10), (12, 10), (2, 10)
Node 11: (10, 11), (7, 11), (12, 11), (4, 11)
Node 12: (10, 12), (11, 12), (7, 12), (13, 12)
Node 13: (0, 13), (14, 13), (5, 13), (7, 13), (12, 13)
Node 14: (9, 14), (6, 14), (1, 14), (0, 14), (13, 14)

Now, let's identify the distinct 3-stars:
1. <0, (6, 8, 13)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 14)>
3. <2, (3, 7, 10)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 5, 11)>
6. <5, (4, 9, 13)>
7. <6, (0, 1, 14)>
8. <7, (3, 11, 13)>
9. <8, (0, 3, 6)>
10. <9, (5, 8, 14)>
11. <10, (2, 11, 12)>
12. <11, (4, 7, 12)>
13. <12, (10, 11, 13)>
14. <13, (0, 7, 14)>
15. <14, (1, 6, 9)>

There are a total of 15 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [15].
