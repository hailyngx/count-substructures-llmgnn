Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:
- <5, (9, 1, 8)>
- <9, (5, 11, 13)>
- <4, (7, 8, 12)>
- <7, (4, 6, 12)>
- <1, (5, 3, 14)>
- <3, (1, 0, 2)>
- <10, (11, 6, 13)>
- <11, (9, 10, 12)>
- <8, (5, 4, 13)>
- <13, (9, 10, 8)>
- <12, (4, 7, 11)>
- <0, (3, 2, )>
- <2, (4, 3, 6)>
- <6, (5, 7, 10)>
- <14, (1, 10, 8)>
  
We have found 15 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
