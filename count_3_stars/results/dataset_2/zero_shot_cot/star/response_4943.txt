Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 16) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 18) (6, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 9) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 16) (0, 16) (0, 9) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 2) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible central nodes are 4, 7, 14, 17, 2, 18, 5, 6, and 13 based on the given edges.

Let's find the 3-stars:
- Central node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 13: <4, (7, 12, 13)>
- Central node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 15: <7, (4, 11, 15)>
- Central node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 13: <14, (7, 13, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is counted as [3].
