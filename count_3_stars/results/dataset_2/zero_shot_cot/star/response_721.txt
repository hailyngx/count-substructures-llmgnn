Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three leaves. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (3, 4, 13)>
2. <3, (1, 5, 10)>
3. <8, (5, 7, 13)>
4. <13, (1, 6, 8)>
5. <0, (2, 9, 12)>
6. <2, (0, 3, 14)>
7. <5, (3, 7, 8)>
8. <4, (1, 10, 12)>
9. <12, (0, 4, 14)>
10. <6, (8, 13, -)>
11. <7, (5, 11, 13)>
12. <11, (0, 4, 7)>
13. <14, (2, 7, 12)>
14. <10, (3, 4, 9)>
15. <9, (0, 3, 10)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
