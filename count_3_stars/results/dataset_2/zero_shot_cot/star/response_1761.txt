Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 2) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 17) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 14) (18, 16) (13, 15) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 7) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 8) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (12, 14) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star graph. A node with exactly 3 neighboring nodes will be the center of a 3-star. Let's list these potential center nodes:
<11>
<16>
<3>
<9>
<1>
<10>
<5>
<4>
<18>
<0>
<8>
<12>

Now, let's find the 3-stars that contain one of these nodes as the center:

<11, (16, 10, 9)>
<16, (11, 18, 2)>
<3, (15, 14, 6)>
<9, (11, 19, 8)>
<1, (14, 4, 12)>
<10, (11, 0, 2)>
<5, (6, 13, 4)>
<4, (1, 14, 5)>
<18, (16, 2, 19)>
<0, (10, 13, 12)>
<8, (19, 7, 9)>
<12, (14, 0, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
