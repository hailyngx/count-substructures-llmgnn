Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges. 

Let's list them:
1. <8, (13, 2, 9)>
2. <13, (8, 2, 0)>
3. <7, (12, 3, 2)>
4. <12, (7, 14, 2)>
5. <2, (8, 13, 4)>
6. <0, (8, 13, 11)>
7. <14, (12, 2, 0)>
8. <3, (7, 11, 10)>
9. <11, (0, 3, 9)>
10. <9, (8, 13, 4)>
11. <4, (2, 9, 10)>
12. <1, (9, 4, 6)>
13. <6, (0, 4, 10)>
14. <5, (8, 7, 11)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 14 different 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
