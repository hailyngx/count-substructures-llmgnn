Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 3
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 1
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 1

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
