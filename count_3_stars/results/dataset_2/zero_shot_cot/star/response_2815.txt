Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, identify the central nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Then, for each central node, check if there are exactly three leaves connected to it.

There are three central nodes with three edges each:
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 6)
- Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 6)

Now, let's check the 3-stars for each central node:
- For node 5: <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- For node 1: <1, (5, 3, 6)>
- For node 7: <7, (5, 9, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
