Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 15) (1, 12) (1, 16) (17, 5) (17, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (15, 14) (15, 4) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 18) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 4) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) 

Response:
We can start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming the leaves of the 3-stars. 

From the given list of edges:
- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes: 9, 13, 17, and 0.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 other nodes: 5, 10, 3, and 0.
- Node 18 is connected to 4 other nodes: 17, 19, 16, and 8.
- Node 16 is connected to 4 other nodes: 7, 1, 18, and 6.

Now we can count the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- For node 5: <5, (9, 13, 17)>, <5, (9, 13, 0)>
- For node 9: <9, (5, 10, 3)>, <9, (5, 10, 0)>
- For node 18: <18, (17, 19, 16)>, <18, (17, 19, 8)>
- For node 16: <16, (7, 1, 18)>, <16, (7, 1, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
