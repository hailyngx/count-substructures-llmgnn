Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Following the definition of a 3-star graph, let's identify and count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 4: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6)
2. Node 7: (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8)
3. Node 1: (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5)
4. Node 3: (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2)
5. Node 8: (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6)
6. Node 5: (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0)
7. Node 6: (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5)
8. Node 2: (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0)
9. Node 9: (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0)
10. Node 0: (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <4, (7, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 3, 6)>, and <5, (7, 1, 6)>.
