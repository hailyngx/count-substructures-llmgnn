Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 4.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 10.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 2, and 14.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (6, 8, 14)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<8, (5, 6, 4)>
<13, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, 7, 12)>
<11, (6, 8, 3)>
<2, (7, 1, 10)>
<1, (7, 13, 12)>
<10, (7, 2, 14)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars found in the graph. Thus, the final answer is [9].
