Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (3, 6, 11)>
<2, (10, 11, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 14)>
<4, (12, 14, 8)>
<5, (10, 11, 5)>
<6, (1, 11, 0)>
<7, (3, 14, 2)>
<8, (4, 14, 2)>
<9, (8, 0, 13)>
<10, (10, 14, 5)>
<11, (6, 1, 2)>
<12, (12, 9, 0)>
<13, (9, 12, 6)>
<14, (13, 4, 10)>
<0, (6, 9, 12)>

There are a total of 14 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [14].
