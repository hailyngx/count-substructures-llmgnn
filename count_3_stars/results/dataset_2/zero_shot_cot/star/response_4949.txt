Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the 3-stars first. Remember, in a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 

[There are 10 unique 3-stars in total.]
