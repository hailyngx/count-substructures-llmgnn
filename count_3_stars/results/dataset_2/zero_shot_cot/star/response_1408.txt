Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 27) (9, 13) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 3) (18, 27) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 11) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 15) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 15) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 12) (27, 13) (8, 23) (8, 25) (0, 29) (0, 13) (5, 6) (5, 21) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 7) (29, 0) (29, 17) (29, 4) (29, 11) (4, 12) (4, 29) (4, 21) (2, 15) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 3) (13, 9) (13, 27) (13, 0) (13, 25) (16, 24) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 19) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 11) (28, 25) (1, 17) (1, 28) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 7) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 28) (14, 26) (14, 5) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 15) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 24) (3, 28) (19, 16) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 28) (25, 10) (10, 14) (10, 25) (21, 22) (21, 5) (21, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars.

Let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<9, (22, 27, 13)>
<22, (9, 23, 11)>
<23, (22, 8, 15)>
<27, (9, 18, 12)>
<4, (12, 29, 21)>
<13, (9, 27, 0)>
<16, (24, 28, 19)>
<28, (16, 1, 11)>
<1, (17, 28, 25)>
<15, (23, 12, 2)>
<10, (14, 25, 21)>
<7, (6, 17, 16)>
<3, (26, 6, 24)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [13].
