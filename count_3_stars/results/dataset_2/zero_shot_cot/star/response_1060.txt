Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 13) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 9) (5, 17) (5, 14) (19, 18) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 16) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 15) (14, 5) (14, 3) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 13) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-stars. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, the 3-stars can be identified by looking for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. Let's find all the 3-stars:

1. <0, (8, 12, 16)>
2. <1, (9, 13, 18)>
3. <2, (3, 15, -)>
4. <3, (7, 14, 16)>
5. <4, (6, 8, 18)>
6. <5, (14, 17, -)>
7. <6, (4, 7, 11)>
8. <9, (1, 10, 11)>
9. <13, (1, 15, 18)>
10. <14, (3, 5, -)>
11. <15, (2, 13, 16)>
12. <16, (0, 3, 17)>
13. <17, (5, 6, -)>
14. <18, (1, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
