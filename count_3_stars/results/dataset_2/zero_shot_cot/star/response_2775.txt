Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 12)>
<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<3, (11, 14, 13)>
<11, (6, 3, 14)>
<0, (5, 11, -)>
<7, (14, 1, 8)>
<13, (5, 3, 12)>
<14, (6, 3, 7)>
<2, (5, 11, 4)>
<8, (6, 7, 1)>
<1, (7, 2, 8)>
<12, (9, 11, 13)>
<10, (6, 1, 12)>
<4, (6, 13, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [15].
