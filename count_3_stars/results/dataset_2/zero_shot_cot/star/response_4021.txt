Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (7, 8, 1)>
<4, (8, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 1, 0)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 7, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
