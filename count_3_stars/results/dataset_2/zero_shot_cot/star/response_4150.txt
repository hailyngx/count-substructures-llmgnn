Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their incident edges are as follows:
- Node 0: (5, 0), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 1), (0, 6)
- Node 1: (9, 1), (4, 2), (7, 1), (1, 0)
- Node 2: (5, 2), (9, 2), (4, 2), (8, 2), (2, 5)
- Node 3: (5, 3), (4, 3), (8, 3), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 0), (3, 6)
- Node 4: (9, 4), (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 6), (2, 4), (6, 4)
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (2, 5)
- Node 6: (4, 6), (0, 6), (3, 6), (6, 0)
- Node 7: (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1)
- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 7), (2, 8)
- Node 9: (5, 9), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1), (7, 9), (1, 9)

There are three 3-stars in this graph, which are as follows:
<0, (5, 0, 7)>
<1, (9, 1, 7)>
<2, (5, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
