Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 2. This forms a 3-star: <0, (4, 7, 2)>
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 2, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 2, 9)>
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 7, 5, and 1. This forms a 3-star: <2, (7, 5, 1)>
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 6, 0, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <3, (6, 0, 9)>
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 9, and 5. This forms a 3-star: <4, (7, 9, 5)>
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 4, 6, and 2. This forms a 3-star: <5, (4, 6, 2)>
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 1. This forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 7, 1)>
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 0, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 0, 8)>
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 7, 5, and 0. This forms a 3-star: <8, (7, 5, 0)>
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 3. This forms a 3-star: <9, (4, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is 10.
Thus, the final answer is [10].
