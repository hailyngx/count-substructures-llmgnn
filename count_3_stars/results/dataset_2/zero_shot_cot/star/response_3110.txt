Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star has one central node, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges.

Central nodes: 4, 7, 10, 13

Next, let's list the leaves connected to each central node:

Central node 4: (3, 1, 0)
Central node 7: (2, 11, 14)
Central node 10: (0, 3, 8)
Central node 13: (1, 6, 0)

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (3, 1, 0)>
<7, (2, 11, 14)>
<10, (0, 3, 8)>
<13, (1, 6, 0)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
