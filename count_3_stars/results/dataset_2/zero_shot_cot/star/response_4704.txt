Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 5) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 11) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 1) (7, 6) (7, 17) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 0) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 14, and 1. <3, (17, 14, 1)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 9, and 16. <15, (10, 9, 16)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 11, and 18. <10, (15, 11, 18)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 13, and 12. <11, (15, 13, 12)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 1, and 7. <17, (3, 1, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 2, and 16. <9, (15, 2, 16)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 2, and 5. <14, (3, 2, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 4, and 5. <1, (17, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 19, and 5. <4, (18, 19, 5)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 8, and 4. <18, (10, 8, 4)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 14, and 13. <0, (8, 14, 13)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 19, and 16. <12, (11, 19, 16)>

2. Count the number of 3-stars found:
There are a total of 12 unique 3-stars identified.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].
