Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (5, 7, 6)>
<3, (5, 1, 4)>
<4, (7, 6, 0)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (4, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 4)>
<8, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 7, 0)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
