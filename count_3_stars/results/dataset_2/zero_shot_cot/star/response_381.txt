Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 12) (1, 7) (1, 17) (15, 10) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (12, 17) (12, 2) (3, 7) (3, 13) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (18, 16) (18, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

<11, (16, 19, 5)>
<16, (11, 13, 8)>
<5, (11, 9, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, -)>
<4, (7, 8, -)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<10, (15, 2, -)>
<17, (11, 1, 13)>
<8, (16, 5, 9)>
<0, (14, 2, 19)>
<14, (0, 6, 18)>
<2, (10, 12, -)>
<1, (7, 17, -)>
<15, (10, -, -)>
<13, (16, 17, 3)>
<12, (17, 2, -)>
<3, (7, 13, -)>
<19, (11, 0, 14)>
<6, (16, 7, 0)>
<18, (16, 14, -)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [20].
