Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<0, (9, 1, 3)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (6, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

[# of 3-stars = 10]
