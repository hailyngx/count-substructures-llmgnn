Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 7) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (16, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 14) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 7) (4, 11) (7, 8) (7, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 17, and 6.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 1, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 15, 10, and 17.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 1.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 0, and 18.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 13, and 11.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 16, and 0.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 15, 10, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 18, 19, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to node 11.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8 and 14.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 1.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 19, 14, and 16.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 17, 18, and 14.

Therefore, there are <3, (15, 17, 6)>, <6, (3, 9, 5)>, <15, (3, 1, 12)>, <9, (3, 6, 11)>, <1, (15, 10, 17)>, <17, (3, 9, 1)>, <16, (8, 0, 18)>, <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <2, (5, 13, 11)>, <8, (5, 16, 0)>, <12, (15, 10, 14)>, <13, (6, 2, 0)>, <14, (18, 19, 12)> 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
