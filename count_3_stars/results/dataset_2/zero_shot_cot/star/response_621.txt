Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 22) (15, 26) (15, 17) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 20) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 9) (0, 24) (0, 4) (27, 21) (27, 19) (8, 5) (23, 26) (23, 4) (23, 7) (23, 13) (4, 0) (4, 23) (4, 29) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 25) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 9) (17, 7) (25, 18) (25, 13) (25, 14) (25, 24) (11, 14) (19, 5) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 1) (16, 14) (10, 21) (10, 29) (10, 26) (21, 27) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 12) (21, 22) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 6) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 29) (1, 9) (1, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (29, 26) (29, 6) (7, 3) (7, 23) (7, 17) (7, 6) (13, 23) (13, 25) (13, 21) (6, 12) (6, 29) (6, 7) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 24) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 14) (20, 5) (20, 22) (22, 3) (22, 21) (22, 20) 

Response:
Let's count the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 5: connected to nodes 2, 8, 20.
   - Node 9: connected to nodes 1, 0, 12.
   - Node 2: connected to nodes 5, 18, 12.
   - Node 18: connected to nodes 2, 19, 25.
   - Node 19: connected to nodes 5, 27, 18.
   - Node 21: connected to nodes 27, 10, 22.
   - Node 26: connected to nodes 15, 23, 29.
   - Node 0: connected to nodes 9, 24, 4.
   - Node 4: connected to nodes 0, 23, 29.
   - Node 12: connected to nodes 9, 2, 21.
   - Node 29: connected to nodes 4, 10, 26.
   - Node 7: connected to nodes 3, 23, 6.
   - Node 13: connected to nodes 23, 25, 21.
   - Node 6: connected to nodes 12, 29, 7.
   - Node 14: connected to nodes 25, 11, 16.
   - Node 24: connected to nodes 0, 25, 14.

2. Count the number of 3-stars by combining the identified nodes:
   - <5, (2, 8, 20)>
   - <9, (1, 0, 12)>
   - <2, (5, 18, 12)>
   - <18, (2, 19, 25)>
   - <19, (5, 27, 18)>
   - <21, (27, 10, 22)>
   - <26, (15, 23, 29)>
   - <0, (9, 24, 4)>
   - <4, (0, 23, 29)>
   - <12, (9, 2, 21)>
   - <29, (4, 10, 26)>
   - <7, (3, 23, 6)>
   - <13, (23, 25, 21)>
   - <6, (12, 29, 7)>
   - <14, (25, 11, 16)>
   - <24, (0, 25, 14)>

[The total number of 3-stars is 16.]
