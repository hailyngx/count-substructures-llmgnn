Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 0) (15, 5) (15, 6) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 18) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential center nodes of the 3-stars. 

The nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them are: 
- Node 5 (connected to 3, 15, 14)
- Node 9 (connected to 6, 4, 3)
- Node 6 (connected to 15, 11, 19)
- Node 3 (connected to 9, 0, 18)
- Node 12 (connected to 13, 10, 18)

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph. 

1. Node 5: <5, (9, 15, 14)>
2. Node 9: <9, (6, 4, 3)>
3. Node 6: <6, (15, 11, 19)>
4. Node 3: <3, (9, 0, 18)>
5. Node 12: <12, (13, 10, 18)>

So, there are a total of 5 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [5].
