Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 11) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 12) (8, 15) (8, 5) (1, 16) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 7) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph based on the definition provided.

- The 3-star structures will consist of a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 3: (3, 15), (3, 7), (3, 5) - Forms a 3-star structure <3, (15, 7, 5)>
2. For node 15: (15, 3), (15, 10), (15, 8), (15, 5), (15, 11) - Forms two 3-star structures <15, (3, 10, 8)> and <15, (3, 5, 11)>
3. For node 5: (5, 3), (5, 15), (5, 8), (5, 10) - Forms a 3-star structure <5, (3, 15, 8)>
4. For node 10: (10, 15), (10, 5), (10, 13), (10, 2), (10, 14) - Forms a 3-star structure <10, (15, 13, 2)>
5. For node 14: (14, 9), (14, 10), (14, 11), (14, 18) - Forms a 3-star structure <14, (9, 10, 11)>
6. For node 0: (0, 17), (0, 7), (0, 18), (0, 19), (0, 6), (6, 0), (6, 19), (6, 18) - Forms two 3-star structures <0, (17, 7, 18)> and <0, (17, 19, 6)>
7. For nodes 10, 13, 11, and 18: Connected to each other - Not forming a 3-star structure

After analyzing all the connections, we find 7 unique 3-stars described as above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [7].
