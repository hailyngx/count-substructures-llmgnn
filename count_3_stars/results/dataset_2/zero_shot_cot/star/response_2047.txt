Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph as follows:

1. Count the number of triangles, which can each be considered as a potential 3-star:

(1, 3, 4) -> <1, (3, 4, 8)>
(1, 3, 2) -> <1, (3, 2, 8)>
(1, 4, 2) -> <1, (4, 2, 8)>
(3, 4, 2) -> <3, (4, 2, 8)>
(3, 4, 8) -> <3, (4, 8, 1)>
(4, 2, 8) -> <4, (2, 8, 1)>

2. Count the number of 3-stars that are not triangles but include the center node if two of the leaves are adjacent. We find:

<5, (3, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6. So, the answer is [6].
