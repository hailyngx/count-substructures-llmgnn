Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (0, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 18) (18, 3) (18, 16) (18, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 2: (2, 14, 7), (2, 6, 9), (2, 6, 7)
- From node 3: (3, 19, 18)
- From node 4: (4, 8, 5), (4, 1, 10), (4, 11, 13)
- From node 5: (5, 17, 6), (5, 4, 12)
- From node 6: (6, 17, 8), (6, 5, 2), (6, 19, 3), (6, 9, 13)
- From node 10: (10, 1, 16), (10, 0, 12)
- From node 11: (11, 14, 13)
- From node 12: (12, 5, 13)
- From node 13: (13, 12, 18)
- From node 14: (14, 17, 2), (14, 11, 16)
- From node 16: (16, 14, 18)
- From node 17: (17, 6, 5)
- From node 18: (18, 3, 16)

There are 16 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [16]. 

List of unique 3-stars: 
<2, 14, 7>, <2, 6, 9>, <2, 6, 7>, <3, 19, 18>, <4, 8, 5>, <4, 1, 10>, <4, 11, 13>, <5, 17, 6>, <5, 4, 12>, <6, 17, 8>, <6, 5, 2>, <6, 19, 3>, <6, 9, 13>, <10, 1, 16>, <10, 0, 12>, <11, 14, 13>, <12, 5, 13>, <13, 12, 18>, <14, 17, 2>, <14, 11, 16>, <16, 14, 18>, <17, 6, 5>, <18, 3, 16>
