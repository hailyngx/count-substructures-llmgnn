Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 5) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 18) (18, 13) (18, 9) (19, 0) (19, 7) (6, 17) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 12) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 17) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes with degree 3. These nodes can act as potential centers for 3-stars. 

The nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 2, 4, 17.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 0: (0, 8, 14), (0, 3, 19), (0, 13, 1)
- For node 2: (2, 4, 14), (2, 3, 14)
- For node 4: (4, 8, 15)
- For node 17: (17, 16, 6), (17, 16, 5), (17, 12, 5), (17, 12, 6)

Therefore, we have a total of <0, (8, 14, 3)>, <2, (4, 14, 3)>, <4, (8, 15, 4)>, <17, (16, 6, 5)>, and <17, (12, 6, 5)>.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
