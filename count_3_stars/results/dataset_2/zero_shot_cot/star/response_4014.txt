Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 26) (10, 4) (10, 21) (17, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 20) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 21) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 18) (11, 22) (11, 0) (11, 18) (20, 4) (20, 5) (20, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 2) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (23, 20) (23, 9) (23, 12) (26, 7) (26, 8) (26, 27) (8, 26) (8, 28) (28, 7) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 15) (12, 23) (12, 9) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 0) (15, 22) (15, 28) (15, 19) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 27) (14, 22) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 25) (2, 13) (2, 25) (2, 19) (24, 29) (24, 18) (9, 23) (9, 12) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 24) (18, 27) (18, 0) (27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 18) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-star structures:

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 20 in separate edges, forming a 3-star structure <4, (7, 10, 20)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 28 in separate edges, forming a 3-star structure <7, (4, 6, 28)>.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 21, and 23 in separate edges, forming a 3-star structure <10, (4, 21, 23)>.
- Node 13, 21, and 29 are all connected to each other, forming a 3-star structure <13, (21, 29)>.

Therefore, we have found 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
