Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 25) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 6) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 13) (26, 7) (21, 5) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 29) (13, 19) (13, 27) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 17) (27, 6) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 11) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 23) (25, 8) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 9) (8, 29) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 5) (29, 20) (29, 24) (29, 27) (29, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 2) (1, 19) (1, 11) (1, 28) (0, 28) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (28, 10) (28, 1) (28, 0) (28, 14) (28, 5) (14, 19) (14, 28) (2, 24) (2, 11) (2, 3) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 28) (18, 0) (18, 6) (22, 10) (22, 16) (22, 11) (17, 27) (17, 0) (23, 25) (23, 16) (3, 9) (3, 16) (3, 2) (6, 20) (6, 27) (6, 12) (6, 18) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. 
Based on the given edges, we can find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The possible central nodes could be: 11, 5, 9, 7, 19, 28, and 3. 

Next, we can check the number of 3-stars for each central node:
For node 11:  <11, (7, 1, 2)>  
For node 5:  <5, (21, 10, 0)>
For node 9:  <9, (25, 8, 12)>
For node 7:  <7, (25, 26, 11)>
For node 19:  <19, (1, 13, 14)>
For node 28:  <28, (10, 1, 0)>
For node 3:  <3, (2, 16, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7. 
So, the final answer is [7].
