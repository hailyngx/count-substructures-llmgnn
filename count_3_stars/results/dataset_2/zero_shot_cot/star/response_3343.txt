Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Let's break it down by central nodes:
- Central Node 1: 1
- Central Node 2: 1
- Central Node 3: 1
- Central Node 4: 1
- Central Node 5: 1
- Central Node 6: 1
- Central Node 8: 1
- Central Node 10: 1
- Central Node 11: 1
- Central Node 13: 1
- Central Node 14: 1
- Central Node 15: 1
- Central Node 16: 1
- Central Node 17: 1
- Central Node 18: 1
- Central Node 19: 1
- Central Node 20: 1
- Central Node 21: 1
- Central Node 22: 1
- Central Node 23: 1
- Central Node 24: 1
- Central Node 25: 1
- Central Node 26: 1
- Central Node 27: 0
- Central Node 28: 1
- Central Node 29: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [27]
