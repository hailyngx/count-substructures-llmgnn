Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The total number of triangles can be calculated using the formula: \(\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the graph.

Substitute \(n = 10\) into the formula:
\(\frac{10(10-1)(10-2)}{6}\) = \(\frac{10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8}{6}\) = 120.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[<5, (9, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <4, (9, 0, 6)>, <7, (9, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 3)>, <3, (9, 1, 0)>, <2, (4, 3, 8)>, <8, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 1)>, <0, (4, 1, 3)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
