Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 10) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 19) (18, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes with degree 3, as they could potentially be the center of a 3-star. These nodes are: 1, 4, 8, 15, and 18.

Now, let's examine each of these nodes and determine if they are indeed the center of a 3-star:

- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 7) => (1, (3, 7)) ✦
- Node 4: (4, 12), (4, 5) => (4, (12, 5)) ✦
- Node 8: (8, 11), (8, 10) => (8, (11, 10)) ✦
- Node 15: (15, 16), (15, 10) => (15, (16, 10)) ✦
- Node 18: (18, 5) => No 3-star

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have:
- 4 unique 3-stars <1, (3, 7)> <4, (12, 5)> <8, (11, 10)> <15, (16, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
