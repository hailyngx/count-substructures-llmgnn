Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 12) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify groups of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 4 is connected to nodes {7, 12, 0, 14, 6, 2}.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes {4, 0, 11, 1}.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes {7, 2, 14, 5, 9}.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes {14, 13}.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes {9, 5, 11, 6}.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes {3, 5}.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes {4, 8, 2, 11}.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes {1, 8, 2}.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes {7, 8, 6, 0, 12}.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes {1, 8, 13, 2}.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes {4, 7, 11, 12}.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes {4, 11, 0, 2, 10}.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes {12, 14}.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes {4, 1, 6, 9, 5, 12}.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes {4, 1, 3, 10}.

From the above analysis, we can see that there is only one 3-star in the graph:
<4, (7, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [1].
