Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 18) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 8) (19, 0) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 13) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 18) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 3, 4, and 18
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 8, and 17
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 7, and 9
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 1, 12, and 13
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 7, 15, and 16
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 1, 10, and 18

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 4, 18)>
- <5, (2, 8, 17)>
- <6, (2, 7, 9)>
- <10, (1, 12, 13)>
- <11, (7, 15, 16)>
- <13, (1, 10, 18)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
