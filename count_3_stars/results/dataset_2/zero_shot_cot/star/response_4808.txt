Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 1) (27, 5) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 23) (8, 0) (8, 23) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 18) (23, 25) (23, 8) (23, 13) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 26) (22, 7) (26, 12) (26, 11) (20, 29) (20, 2) (20, 6) (29, 20) (29, 13) (29, 15) (29, 4) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 21) (28, 19) (28, 2) (1, 27) (1, 24) (6, 20) (6, 2) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 10) (9, 0) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 14) (15, 29) (24, 3) (24, 1) (24, 13) (24, 21) (4, 29) (4, 5) (4, 17) (5, 27) (5, 4) (5, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 5) (13, 23) (13, 29) (13, 24) (13, 10) (17, 4) (17, 2) (10, 16) (10, 13) (19, 28) (19, 14) (21, 11) (21, 24) (2, 7) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 6) (2, 17) (14, 9) (14, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, let's first list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (27, 11, 8)>
<27, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (25, 24, 18)>
<25, (3, 9, 23)>
<8, (0, 23, 16)>
<23, (25, 8, 13)>
<7, (12, 22, 9)>
<12, (8, 7, 16)>
<22, (7, 26, 2)>
<26, (12, 11, 2)>
<20, (29, 2, 6)>
<29, (20, 13, 15)>
<11, (0, 26, 21)>
<28, (19, 2, 2)>
<1, (27, 24, 24)>
<6, (20, 2, 2)>
<16, (8, 12, 18)>
<9, (0, 25, 7)>
<15, (29, 4, 29)>
<24, (3, 1, 13)>
<4, (29, 5, 17)>
<5, (27, 4, 18)>
<18, (3, 8, 16)>
<13, (23, 29, 24)>
<17, (4, 2, 2)>
<10, (16, 13, 13)>
<19, (28, 14, 14)>
<21, (11, 24, 24)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[28]
