Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 13) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star structures. These nodes must have exactly 3 incident edges each. 
Based on the given edges, the nodes with 3 incident edges are: 1, 3, 5, 10, 11, 14, and 0. 

Now, we need to check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star structure. 
Starting with node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 14, 5, 13, and 7. However, not all of these connections form a 3-star structure.

Moving on to node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 14, and 9. We found a 3-star: <3, (1, 11, 14)>.

Checking node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 13, 2, and 0. However, not all of these connections form a 3-star structure.

Moving on to node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 2, and 14. However, not all of these connections form a 3-star structure.

Checking node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 5, and 1. We found a 3-star: <11, (3, 10, 5)>.

Checking node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 10, 4, and 0. However, not all of these connections form a 3-star structure.

Checking node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 14, 7, and 2. However, not all of these connections form a 3-star structure.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <3, (1, 11, 14)> and <11, (3, 10, 5)>.
