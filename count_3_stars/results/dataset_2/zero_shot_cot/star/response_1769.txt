Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 1, 0)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<6, (4, 7, 2)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<0, (9, 3, 6)>

Now, to get the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we count the number of unique 3-stars listed above.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
