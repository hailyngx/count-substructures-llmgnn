Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 11) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

We will list out all the 3-star structures in the graph:

<5, (9, 12, 1)>
<9, (8, 7, 5)>
<1, (2, 14, 3)>
<3, (4, 0, 5)>
<8, (1, 13, 9)>
<13, (2, 0, 8)>
<7, (6, 10, 9)>
<12, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (10, 13, 1)>
<4, (6, 0, 3)>
<11, (0, 13, 4)>
<14, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (3, 11, 4)>
<6, (7, 14, 4)>
<10, (2, 3, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
