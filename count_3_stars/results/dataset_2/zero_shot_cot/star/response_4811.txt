Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 16) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 7) (0, 16) (14, 18) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 18) (7, 13) (7, 16) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 19) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <5, (3, 9, 13)>
2. <6, (4, 9, 16)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
4. <10, (11, 12, 17)>
5. <11, (8, 10, 19)>
6. <17, (2, 8, 10)>
7. <2, (1, 15, 17)>
8. <18, (7, 14, 4)>
9. <0, (5, 15, 16)>
10. <14, (4, 18, 7)>
11. <13, (5, 7, 16)>
12. <15, (1, 2, 16)>
13. <8, (11, 17, 19)>
14. <19, (8, 12, 11)>
15. <7, (13, 16, 18)>
16. <12, (3, 10, 19)>
17. <4, (1, 6, 14)>
18. <9, (5, 6, 13)>
19. <16, (0, 6, 15)>
20. <1, (3, 4, 15)>

There are a total of [20] 3-stars in the graph.
