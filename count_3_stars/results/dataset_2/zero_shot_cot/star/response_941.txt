Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 17) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 15) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 6) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 2) (18, 13) 

Response:
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in this graph. Let's identify them:
- Node 8: (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 11: (1, 11) (15, 11) (7, 11) (19, 11) (12, 11) (11 has degree 5, not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 16: (9, 16) (1, 16) (0, 16) (16 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 0: (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 0) (0 has degree 3, potential center of a 3-star)
- Node 7: (5, 7) (1, 7) (7, 11) (7 has degree 3, potential center of a 3-star)
- Node 5: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5 has degree 3, potential center of a 3-star)
- Node 9: (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 3: (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3 has degree 3, potential center of a 3-star)
- Node 1: (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1 has degree 3, potential center of a 3-star)
- Node 14: (15, 14) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 12: (14, 12) (6, 12) (12, 11) (12 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 19: (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 2: (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 4: (3, 4) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4 has degree 3, potential center of a 3-star)
- Node 6: (12, 6) (4, 6) (6, 10) (6 has degree 3, potential center of a 3-star)
- Node 10: (8, 10) (4, 10) (6, 10) (10 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star)
- Node 13: (9, 13) (2, 13) (13, 18) (13 has degree 3, potential center of a 3-star)
- Node 17: (8, 17) (19, 17) (2, 17) (17 has degree 3, potential center of a 3-star)
- Node 18: (13, 18) (18 has degree 1, not a center of a 3-star)

Based on the identified potential center nodes of the 3-stars, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: {0, 14, 15} <0, (14, 15, 16)>
- Node 3: {3, 4, 5} <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 5: {5, 7, 9} <5, (7, 9, 3)>
- Node 1: {1, 7, 11} <1, (7, 11, 16)>
- Node 4: {4, 6, 10} <4, (6, 10, 3)>
- Node 6: {4, 6, 12} <6, (4, 12, 10)>
- Node 13: {2, 13, 18} <13, (2, 18, 9)>
- Node 17: {2, 17, 8} <17, (2, 8, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
