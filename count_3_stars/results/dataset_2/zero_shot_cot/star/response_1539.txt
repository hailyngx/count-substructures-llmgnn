Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 7) (18, 1) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 18) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 19) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (14, 9) (14, 16) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <3, (15, 1, 0)>
2. <15, (3, 10, 19)>
3. <5, (8, 11, -)>
4. <9, (8, 14, -)>
5. <1, (3, 10, 18)>
6. <10, (15, 1, 13)>
7. <17, (15, 12, 7)>
8. <18, (1, 8, -)>
9. <0, (3, 7, 16)>
10. <7, (17, 0, -)>
11. <8, (5, 9, 18)>
12. <16, (0, 19, 14)>
13. <6, (3, 13, -)>
14. <2, (12, 13, 11)>
15. <12, (3, 17, 2)>

[The total number of 3-stars is 15]
