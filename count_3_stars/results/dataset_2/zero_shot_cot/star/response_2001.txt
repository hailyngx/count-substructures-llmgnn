Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the edges adjacent to each node. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 6: No 3-stars (connects to 3 nodes).
- Node 9: No 3-stars (connects to 5 nodes).
- Node 4: 1 3-star (connects to nodes 9, 7, 1).
- Node 7: 1 3-star (connects to nodes 6, 9, 4).
- Node 1: 2 3-stars (connects to nodes 9, 4, 2) & (connects to nodes 4, 7, 3).
- Node 3: No 3-stars (connects to 2 nodes).
- Node 5: 1 3-star (connects to nodes 6, 4, 8).
- Node 2: 1 3-star (connects to nodes 9, 1, 8).
- Node 8: No 3-stars (connects to 4 nodes).
- Node 0: No 3-stars (connects to 2 nodes).

Count of 3-stars: 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 7) + 2 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 2) = 6

Therefore, there are [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<4, (9, 7, 1)>,  
<7, (6, 9, 4)>,  
<1, (9, 4, 2)>,  
<1, (4, 7, 3)>,  
<5, (6, 4, 8)>,  
<2, (9, 1, 8)>.
