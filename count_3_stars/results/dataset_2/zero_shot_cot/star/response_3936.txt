Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 25) (14, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (4, 16) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 29) (7, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 20) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 29) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 18) (8, 10) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 28) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 3) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 24) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (29, 21) (29, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (5, 15) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 15) (15, 4) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 25) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 27) (20, 28) (27, 9) (27, 20) (19, 17) (19, 10) (28, 18) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node. This will help us find the 3-stars in the graph.

Node 0: {8, 12, 13}
Node 1: {13, 14, 29}
Node 2: {12, 23}
Node 3: {16, 17}
Node 4: {15, 16, 20, 21}
Node 5: {15}
Node 6: {9, 10, 20, 25}
Node 7: {22, 29}
Node 8: {0, 10, 23, 24}
Node 9: {6, 26, 27}
Node 10: {6, 8, 19}
Node 11: {29}
Node 12: {0, 2}
Node 13: {0, 1, 28}
Node 14: {1}
Node 15: {4, 5, 24, 25}
Node 16: {3, 4, 21}
Node 17: {3, 19}
Node 18: {22, 28, 29}
Node 19: {10, 17}
Node 20: {4, 6, 27, 28}
Node 21: {4, 16, 21, 29}
Node 22: {7, 18, 26}
Node 23: {2, 8, 28}
Node 24: {8, 15}
Node 25: {6, 15, 26}
Node 26: {9, 22, 25}
Node 27: {20, 27}
Node 28: {13, 18, 20, 23}
Node 29: {1, 7, 11, 18, 21}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (8, 12, 13)>
<1, (13, 14, 29)>
<2, (12, 23, )>
<3, (16, 17, )>
<4, (15, 16, 21)>
<5, (15, , )>
<6, (9, 10, 20)>
<7, (22, 29, )>
<8, (0, 10, 23)>
<9, (6, 22, 26)>
<10, (6, 8, 19)>
<11, (29, , )>
<12, (0, 2, )>
<13, (0, 1, 28)>
<14, (1, , )>
<15, (4, 24, 25)>
<16, (3, 4, 21)>
<17, (3, 19, )>
<18, (22, 28, 29)>
<19, (10, 17, )>
<20, (4, 27, 28)>
<21, (4, 16, 29)>
<22, (7, 18, 26)>
<23, (2, 8, 28)>
<24, (8, 15, )>
<25, (6, 15, 26)>
<26, (9, 22, 25)>
<27, (20, , )>
<28, (13, 18, 23)>
<29, (1, 7, 11)>

Therefore, there are [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
