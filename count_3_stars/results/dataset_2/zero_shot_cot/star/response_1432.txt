Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated using the degree of each node in the graph since a 3-star involves a center node connected to three other nodes (leaves). Let's calculate it step-by-step:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 5
- Node 2: degree = 3
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 5
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 5
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 4

2. Find the number of 3-stars for each node with a degree of at least 3 (center node of a 3-star):
- Node 0: 3-stars = 1
- Node 1: 3-stars = 1
- Node 3: 3-stars = 1
- Node 4: 3-stars = 1
- Node 6: 3-stars = 1
- Node 7: 3-stars = 1
- Node 9: 3-stars = 1

3. Find the total number of 3-stars by summing the 3-stars found for each node:
Total 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (7, 3, 6)>, <1, (4, 9, 8)>, <3, (7, 0, 8)>, <4, (7, 9, 1)>, <6, (7, 9, 0)>, <7, (4, 6, 0)>, <9, (4, 6, 0)>
