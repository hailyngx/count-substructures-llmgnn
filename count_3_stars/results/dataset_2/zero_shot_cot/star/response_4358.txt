Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 17) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 6) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star in this graph. 
From the given edges, we can see that the nodes 3, 15, 6, 4, 5, 12, 16, 7, and 9 each have connections to three other nodes. 

Next, we will find 3-stars in the graph by examining the nodes that are connected to each of these potential center nodes. 

For node 3: 
<3, (15, 7, 0)>
<3, (15, 7, 9)>

For node 15: 
<15, (3, 18, 14)>
<15, (3, 18, 17)>

For node 6: 
<6, (5, 14, 12)>
<6, (5, 14, 10)>
<6, (5, 4, 6)>
<6, (5, 4, 14)>
<6, (4, 19, 6)>
<6, (4, 19, 10)>
<6, (12, 1, 6)>
<6, (12, 1, 16)>
<6, (12, 16, 10)>

For node 4: 
<4, (18, 6, 19)>
<4, (18, 6, 11)>
<4, (6, 5, 4)>
<4, (6, 5, 14)>
<4, (6, 14, 4)>
<4, (6, 14, 11)>
<4, (19, 4, 11)>
<4, (19, 5, 4)>
<4, (19, 5, 6)>

For node 5: 
<5, (6, 19, 16)>
<5, (6, 19, 14)>
<5, (6, 14, 5)>
<5, (6, 14, 16)>
<5, (19, 4, 5)>
<5, (19, 4, 6)>
<5, (16, 12, 5)>
<5, (16, 12, 10)>

For node 12: 
<12, (6, 1, 16)>
<12, (6, 1, 12)>
<12, (6, 14, 12)>
<12, (6, 14, 10)>
<12, (16, 5, 12)>
<12, (16, 5, 10)>

For node 16: 
<16, (5, 12, 10)>
<16, (5, 12, 6)>
<16, (5, 6, 16)>
<16, (5, 6, 10)>
<16, (12, 6, 16)>
<16, (12, 6, 10)>

For node 7: 
<7, (3, 11, 14)>
<7, (3, 11, 13)>
<7, (11, 4, 7)>
<7, (11, 4, 14)>

For node 9: 
<9, (3, 2, 0)>
<9, (3, 2, 14)>
<9, (3, 2, 9)>
<9, (2, 13, 9)>

Counting all unique 3-stars found, we get 27 in total. 
So, the final answer is [27].
