Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Since each 3-star consists of a center node and 3 leaves, we need to count all possible combinations of nodes where one node is the center and the other three are the leaves.

We have 15 total nodes in the graph, so there are 15 choices for the center node.

For each center node, we need to find the number of ways we can choose 3 nodes to be the leaves. This can be done using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!), where n is the total number of nodes and k is the number of nodes to choose.

C(14, 3) = 14! / (3! * 11!) = 364 ways to choose 3 leaves from the remaining 14 nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 15 center nodes * 364 ways to choose 3 leaves = 5460 3-stars in total.

Next, let's determine the unique 3-stars in the graph:

- There are 3 leaves for each 3-star, so we need to look for combinations of nodes where one node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

- We can identify the unique 3-stars by looking at each node and its adjacent nodes in the graph.

After considering all the nodes and their adjacent nodes, we find the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 9, 12)>
<5, (0, 7, 12)>
<6, (1, 3, 14)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (3, 9, 12)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<10, (0, 2, 12)>
<11, (12, 13, 14)>
<13, (1, 2, 11)>
<12, (4, 8, 11)>
<14, (6, 7, 5)>

So, the final count of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
