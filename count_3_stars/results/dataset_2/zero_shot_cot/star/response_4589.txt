Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by identifying the nodes that are leaves in each 3-star, then tallying the occurrences. Since a 3-star consists of a central node and 3 leaves, we can look for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<3, (1, 6, 10)>
<7, (8, 9, 12)>
<12, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 11)>
<2, (1, 9, 13)>
<11, (1, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 7, 11)>
<10, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 6, 12)>
<4, (3, 6, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
