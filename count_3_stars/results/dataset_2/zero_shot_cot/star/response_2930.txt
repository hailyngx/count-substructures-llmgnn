Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 16) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 16) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 19) (16, 4) (16, 7) (1, 12) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 0) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 17) (14, 12) (14, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 
Nodes with degree 3 will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

Nodes with degree 3: 5, 8, 13, 10, 15, 3, 4, 12, 7, 11, 0, 17, 16, 6, 14

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 8, 10)>
<15, (3, 2, 0)>
<13, (9, 8, 10)>
<10, (9, 13, 11)>
<3, (15, 7, 6)>
<4, (19, 12, 0)>
<12, (8, 4, 14)>
<7, (3, 16, 14)>
<11, (10, 19, 17)>
<0, (15, 4, 6)>
<17, (11, 6, 0)>
<16, (19, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 12, 17)>
<14, (12, 7, 0)>

There are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
