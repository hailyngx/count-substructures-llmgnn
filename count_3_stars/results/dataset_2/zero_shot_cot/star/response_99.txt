Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 26) (4, 9) (4, 17) (28, 16) (28, 6) (28, 19) (29, 0) (0, 1) (0, 29) (0, 14) (0, 22) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 25) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 26) (5, 24) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 24) (17, 4) (17, 18) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 19) (24, 18) (24, 10) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 21) (22, 0) (7, 20) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 7) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 15) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 0) (26, 6) (2, 13) (2, 21) (23, 12) (23, 25) (10, 16) (10, 19) (10, 24) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 21) (15, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 15) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 23) 

Response:
Given the graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges, let's identify the 3-stars.

First, let's determine the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has edges: (1, 16), (1, 3), (1, 20), (1, 0), (1, 8)
- Node 13 has edges: (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 14)
- Node 16 has edges: (16, 11), (16, 28), (16, 1), (16, 10)
- Node 18 has edges: (18, 11), (18, 17), (18, 24), (18, 15)
- Node 24 has edges: (24, 6), (24, 5), (24, 19), (24, 18), (24, 10)
- Node 26 has edges: (26, 11), (26, 27), (26, 0), (26, 6)

Based on the analysis above, we have the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (16, 3, 20)>
<13, (8, 2, 14)>
<16, (11, 28, 10)>
<18, (11, 17, 24)>
<24, (6, 5, 19)>
<26, (11, 27, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
