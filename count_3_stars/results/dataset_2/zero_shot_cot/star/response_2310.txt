Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 19) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 11) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 4) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 10) (0, 15) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (7, 9) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes in the graph. Based on the given edges, the nodes are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}.

Now, we will search for the 3-stars in the graph where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

The possible 3-star combinations are:
1. (2, 4, 14) - No
2. (2, 12, 10) - No
3. (14, 1, 17) - No
4. (2, 4, 18) - No
5. (2, 6, 11) - Yes
6. (2, 12, 3) - No
7. (2, 18, 11) - No
8. (4, 19, 14) - No
9. (0, 1, 15) - No
10. (10, 3, 12) - No
11. (0, 1, 17) - No
12. (19, 4, 9) - No
13. (0, 1, 14) - No
14. (10, 8, 16) - No

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, 6, 11>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
