Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 15) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 15) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 15) (12, 16) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 13) (14, 16) (14, 0) (14, 18) (18, 4) (18, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 19) (13, 17) (13, 0) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 15) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (13, 17, 19)>
<1, (3, 5, 11)>
<2, (10, 15, 17)>
<6, (3, 4, 19)>
<8, (1, 7, 19)>
<15, (2, 16, 17)>
