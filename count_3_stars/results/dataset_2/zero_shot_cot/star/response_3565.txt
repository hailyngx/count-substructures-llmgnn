Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 23) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 7) (22, 14) (22, 23) (22, 16) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 3) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 27) (15, 19) (15, 4) (20, 4) (29, 12) (29, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 12) (26, 6) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 18) (3, 23) (3, 11) (3, 28) (11, 29) (11, 3) (11, 25) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 1) (18, 8) (18, 26) (4, 15) (4, 20) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 5) (25, 11) (25, 7) (25, 24) (21, 6) (21, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 10) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 16) (10, 16) (10, 19) (19, 15) (19, 10) (1, 13) (1, 28) (1, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 21) (12, 14) (12, 29) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the graph. 

From the given edges, we can see the 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 21, 26)>
<9, (6, 2, 7)>
<14, (17, 0, 22)>
<17, (14, 24, 23)>
<22, (14, 23, 16)>
<23, (14, 17, 22)>
<8, (13, 28, 18)>
<13, (8, 26, 1)>
<15, (19, 4, 20)>
<20, (4, 15, 27)>
<29, (12, 11, 0)>
<3, (23, 11, 28)>
<11, (29, 3, 25)>
<28, (8, 26, 3)>
<18, (8, 26, 4)>
<4, (15, 20, 27)>
<27, (13, 4, 15)>
<7, (9, 17, 25)>
<25, (11, 7, 24)>
<21, (6, 2, 0)>
<5, (7, 1, 25)>
<16, (22, 0, 24)>
<24, (17, 25, 16)>
<10, (16, 19, 15)>
<19, (15, 10, 4)>
<1, (13, 28, 5)>
<2, (9, 11, 21)>
<12, (14, 29, 0)>

There are 27 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].
