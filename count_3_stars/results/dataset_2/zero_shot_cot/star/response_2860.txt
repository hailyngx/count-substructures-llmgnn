Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to each one, as these nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 

- Node 4 has edges with nodes 7, 5, 14, and 11.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 4, 11, 14, and 1.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 11, 13, 9, 5, 3, and 1.
- Node 13 has edges with nodes 8, 2, 9, and 0.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 10, 8, 13, 0, and 12.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by considering each potential center node. 

For node 4:
- <4, (7, 5, 14)> is a 3-star.

For node 7:
- <7, (4, 11, 1)> is a 3-star.

For node 8:
- <8, (11, 13, 9)> is a 3-star.

For node 13:
- <13, (8, 2, 9)> is a 3-star.

For node 9:
- <9, (10, 8, 13)> is a 3-star.

After considering all potential center nodes, we have found 5 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
