Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 27) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 22) (1, 12) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (25, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (21, 13) (21, 14) (21, 4) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 22) (26, 28) (26, 10) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 18) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 27) (19, 20) (19, 5) (7, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 2) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 29) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 22) (29, 11) (29, 22) (29, 14) (13, 21) (13, 2) (8, 6) (8, 24) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 12) (23, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 5) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 4) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 20) (18, 25) (18, 16) (4, 15) (4, 21) (4, 11) (4, 0) (22, 1) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 29) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<3, (1, 15, 27)>
<15, (3, 5, 4)>
<6, (9, 10, 27)>
<9, (6, 25, 10)>
<1, (3, 22, 12)>
<20, (25, 18, 2)>
<21, (13, 14, 4)>
<28, (26, 16, 22)>
<26, (28, 10, 22)>
<16, (9, 28, 18)>
<5, (15, 19, 0)>
<19, (20, 5, 2)>
<7, (5, 0, 27)>
<10, (6, 9, 26)>
<11, (24, 4, 29)>
<24, (11, 8, 22)>
<29, (11, 22, 14)>
<13, (21, 2, 0)>
<8, (6, 24, 22)>
<14, (21, 29, 12)>
<23, (9)>
<12, (1, 14)>
<0, (5, 17, 4)>
<17, (0, 2)>
<2, (20, 10, 13)>
<18, (20, 25, 16)>
<4, (15, 21, 11)>
<22, (1, 28, 24)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
