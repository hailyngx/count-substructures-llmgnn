Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 28) (25, 2) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 4) (24, 26) (24, 28) (24, 29) (26, 10) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 0) (15, 5) (15, 26) (16, 9) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 12) (23, 12) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 20) (13, 17) (1, 6) (1, 18) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 22) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 21) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 25) (3, 17) (3, 0) (7, 20) (7, 8) (29, 25) (29, 10) (29, 24) (14, 8) (14, 21) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 23) (21, 22) (21, 14) (21, 27) (27, 17) (27, 21) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 28) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 18) (11, 6) (11, 26) (11, 8) (11, 18) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node as the potential central node and count the number of 3-stars it belongs to. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 26, 3)>
<1, (6, 18, 11)>
<2, (5, 25, 2)>
<3, (17, 27, 0)>
<4, (10, 22, 4)>
<5, (9, 18, 22)>
<6, (1, 11, 0)>
<7, (20, 14, 8)>
<8, (25, 7, 11)>
<9, (5, 16, 19)>
<10, (4, 26, 29)>
<11, (6, 18, 8)>
<12, (10, 19, 23)>
<13, (20, 17, 13)>
<14, (21, 8, 7)>
<15, (5, 26, 15)>
<16, (9, 19, 16)>
<17, (10, 27, 3)>
<18, (5, 1, 18)>
<19, (9, 12, 8)>
<20, (13, 7, 20)>
<21, (22, 14, 27)>
<22, (5, 4, 21)>
<23, (12, 19, 27)>
<24, (26, 29, 28)>
<25, (5, 2, 28)>
<26, (10, 0, 15)>
<27, (17, 21, 3)>
<28, (25, 24, 18)>
<29, (10, 24, 29)>

There are total [30] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
