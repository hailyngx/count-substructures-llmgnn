Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (2, 8) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 18) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 19) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present.

Given the information provided, we can construct the following 3-star tuples from the edges:

<12, (14, 13)>
<13, (14, 3)>
<17, (18, 15)>
<18, (17, 11)>
<19, (11, 16)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars present in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [5].
