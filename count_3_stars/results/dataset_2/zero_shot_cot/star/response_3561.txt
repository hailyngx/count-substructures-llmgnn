Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1. These are nodes 3, 4, 5, and 7. Node 1 connects to each of these nodes, resulting in the formation of 4 different 3-stars, as listed below:

<1, (3, 5, 4)>
<1, (4, 8, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<1, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
