Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 10) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 16) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (15, 19) (15, 0) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 6) (19, 0) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 14) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 19) (12, 17) (12, 8) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 18.
2. Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 9.
3. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 17, 8.
4. Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 6.
5. Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 9.
6. Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 10.
7. Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 6, 12.
8. Node 19 is connected to nodes 15, 5, 18.

Putting these together, we find that there are only two unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (11, 7, 18)>
<8, (11, 16, 9)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
