Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 1)>
<2, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 6)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is: [10].
