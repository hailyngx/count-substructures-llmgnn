Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<0, (10, 1, 12)>
