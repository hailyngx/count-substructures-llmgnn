Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Starting with the degree of each node:
- Node 0: Degree 7
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 5
- Node 5: Degree 3
- Node 6: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 5
- Node 8: Degree 5
- Node 9: Degree 2
- Node 10: Degree 3
- Node 11: Degree 3
- Node 12: Degree 6
- Node 13: Degree 3
- Node 14: Degree 2

Now let's list the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 7, 12)>
<4, (1, 7, 10)>
<5, (2, 6, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
