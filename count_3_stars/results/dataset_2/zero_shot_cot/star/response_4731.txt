Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to node 6.
Nodes connected to node 6: 5, 7, 8, 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. (6, 5, 7, 3)
2. (6, 7, 9, 4)
3. (6, 8, 1, 3)
4. (6, 0, 9, 4)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
<6, (5, 7, 3)> <6, (7, 9, 4)> <6, (8, 1, 3)> <6, (0, 9, 4)>
