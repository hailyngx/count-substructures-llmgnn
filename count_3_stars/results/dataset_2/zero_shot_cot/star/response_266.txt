Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 11, 13)>
<3, (1, 4, 0)>
<6, (2, 5, 11)>
<9, (4, 12, 14)>
<12, (8, 9, 13)>
<14, (0, 1, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 6 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
