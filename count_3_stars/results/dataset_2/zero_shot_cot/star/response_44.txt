Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 11, 2)>
<1, (7, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 14, 13)>
<3, (1, 11, 6)>
<4, (5, 10, 7)>
<5, (13, 9, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 13)>
<7, (1, 4, 10)>
<8, (0, 10, 4)>
<9, (5, 0, 12)>
<10, (4, 8, 7)>
<11, (3, 13, 0)>
<12, (9, 1, 13)>
<13, (5, 12, 6)>
<14, (2, 10, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
