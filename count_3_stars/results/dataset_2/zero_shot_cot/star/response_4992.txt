Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are directly connected to node 4 since it will have the center of the 3-stars. 
The nodes directly connected to node 4 are: 0, 3, 8.

Next, we will check for each node as the center of the 3-star and identify the connected nodes. 
1. Node 0: Connected nodes are 4, 7, 9, 2, 3.
2. Node 3: Connected nodes are 4, 7, 9, 5, 2, 0.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>  
<0, (4, 2, 3)>  
<3, (4, 7, 5)>  
<3, (4, 2, 0)> 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
