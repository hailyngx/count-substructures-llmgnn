Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are connected directly to 4 other nodes, as these nodes can serve as the center of a 3-star. 
From the given edges, nodes 0, 3, 6, and 7 have degree 4.

Next, for each of these nodes, we can check if they form 3-stars. 
Starting from node 0:
- Nodes adjacent to 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 5
- The possible 3-stars involving node 0 are: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, and <0, (3, 4, 5)>.

Next, let's check node 3:
- Nodes adjacent to 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
- The possible 3-stars involving node 3 are: <3, (0, 2, 4)>, and <3, (0, 2, 5)>.

Moving on to node 6:
- Nodes adjacent to 6: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- The possible 3-star involving node 6 is: <6, (0, 1, 8)>.

Finally, node 7:
- Nodes adjacent to 7: 2, 5, 6, 9
- The possible 3-star involving node 7 is: <7, (2, 5, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 8)>.
