Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Let's identify them step-by-step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4: <5, (1, 3, 4)>
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3: <9, (1, 2, 3)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 5: <4, (7, 8, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
