Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 7. 
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 0.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 4.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 0.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 8, 7)>
<1, (5, 4, 0)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 4)>
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
