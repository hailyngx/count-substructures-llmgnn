Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count the 3-stars.

1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1) - <5, (9, 2, 1)>
2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8) - <9, (5, 6, 8)>
3. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 0) - No 3-stars as it's connected to only 2 other nodes.
4. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4) - <1, (5, 9, 4)>
5. Node 3: (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 2) - No 3-stars as it's connected to only 2 other nodes.
6. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 8) - No 3-stars as it's connected to only 2 other nodes.
7. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 0), (7, 2) - <7, (3, 0, 2)>
8. Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 4) - <8, (9, 1, 4)>
9. Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 3), (2, 7) - <2, (5, 3, 7)>
10. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 6) - <0, (5, 9, 6)>

Number of 3-stars: [5]
