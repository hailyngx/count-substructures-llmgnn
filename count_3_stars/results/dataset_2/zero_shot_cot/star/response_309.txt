Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 9, 10
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12
- Node 2: 3, 6, 13, 14
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 7, 10
- Node 5: 4, 8, 12, 14
- Node 6: 2, 4, 7, 13
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6, 11, 13
- Node 8: 5, 14
- Node 9: 0, 1, 11, 14
- Node 10: 0, 4, 11
- Node 11: 7, 9, 10, 14
- Node 12: 1, 5, 14
- Node 13: 2, 6, 7
- Node 14: 2, 5, 8, 11, 12, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 0.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 3.
- There are 2 possible 3-stars centered at Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 9)> and <1, (4, 7, 12)>.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 2.
- There are 2 possible 3-stars centered at Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 6)> and <4, (7, 10, 6)>.
- There are 2 possible 3-stars centered at Node 5: <5, (4, 8, 12)> and <5, (14, 8, 12)>.
- There are 3 possible 3-stars centered at Node 6: <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (13, 4, 7)>, and <6, (2, 13, 7)>.
- There are 3 possible 3-stars centered at Node 7: <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (13, 4, 6)>, and <7, (1, 13, 6)>.
- There is 1 possible 3-star centered at Node 8: <8, (5, 14, 12)>.
- There are 2 possible 3-stars centered at Node 9: <9, (0, 11, 14)> and <9, (1, 11, 14)>.
- There are 2 possible 3-stars centered at Node 10: <10, (0, 4, 11)> and <10, (4, 11, 0)>.
- There are 3 possible 3-stars centered at Node 11: <11, (7, 9, 14)>, <11, (4, 7, 10)>, and <11, (9, 4, 10)>.
- There is 1 possible 3-star centered at Node 12: <12, (1, 5, 14)>.
- There are 3 possible 3-stars centered at Node 13: <13, (2, 6, 7)>, <13, (4, 6, 7)>, and <13, (2, 4, 7)>.
- There is no 3-star centered at Node 14.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 21.
