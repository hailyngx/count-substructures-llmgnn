Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since each 3-star contains a central node and three leaf nodes, we can find them based on the given edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes (potential central nodes): <5>, <9>, <7>, <14>, <1>.

2. Based on the potential central nodes found in step 1, let's identify the 3-stars:
   <5, (9, 13, 1)>
   <9, (5, 4, 14)>
   <7, (5, 12, 10)>
   <14, (9, 0, 1)>
   <1, (5, 13, 4)>
   <1, (13, 11, 6)>
     
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
