Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 28) (9, 20) (9, 7) (1, 23) (1, 0) (1, 27) (3, 5) (3, 13) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 22) (25, 18) (25, 11) (4, 13) (4, 16) (18, 25) (18, 24) (18, 8) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 0) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 2) (29, 27) (29, 8) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 26) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 21) (13, 17) (8, 18) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 27) (16, 4) (16, 2) (7, 9) (7, 26) (7, 15) (11, 5) (11, 25) (11, 8) (24, 18) (24, 2) (27, 1) (27, 29) (27, 19) (27, 2) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 0) (14, 20) (14, 19) (14, 6) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 6) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 24) (2, 27) (23, 1) (12, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 17, 11, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 28, 20, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 23, 0, and 27.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 20, 22, and 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 21.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 25, 24, and 8.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 22, 10, and 6.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 12.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 28, 8, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 20, 19, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 17, 16, and 24.

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars:
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 5: <5, (17, 11, 3)> and <5, (17, 11, 3)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 9: <9, (28, 20, 7)> and <9, (28, 20, 7)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 1: <1, (23, 0, 27)> and <1, (23, 0, 27)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 25: <25, (20, 22, 11)> and <25, (20, 22, 11)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 13: <13, (3, 4, 21)> and <13, (3, 4, 21)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 18: <18, (25, 24, 8)> and <18, (25, 24, 8)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 26: <26, (22, 10, 6)> and <26, (22, 10, 6)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 15: <15, (10, 7, 12)> and <15, (10, 7, 12)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 19: <19, (28, 8, 14)> and <19, (28, 8, 14)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 14: <14, (20, 19, 6)> and <14, (20, 19, 6)>
- 2 unique 3-stars with central node 2: <2, (17, 16, 24)> and <2, (17, 16, 24)>

Total number of 3-stars: [22]
