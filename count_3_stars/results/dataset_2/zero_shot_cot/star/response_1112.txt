Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 4) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (1, 28) (1, 19) (3, 10) (3, 22) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 7) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 27) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 0) (28, 1) (28, 17) (28, 21) (21, 28) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 24) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 5) (18, 5) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 24) (2, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 14) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 5) (23, 25) (23, 27) (27, 8) (27, 23) (27, 20) (29, 26) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 14) (20, 4) (20, 22) (20, 18) (20, 27) (20, 7) (13, 4) (13, 18) (15, 8) (15, 25) (25, 23) (25, 15) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 24) (24, 10) (24, 22) (24, 2) (24, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list down the 3-stars:
<0, (16, 6, 5)>
<2, (10, 12, 14)>
<4, (26, 8, 22)>
<5, (23, 6, 18)>
<7, (17, 14, 20)>
<8, (4, 26, 15)>
<10, (3, 17, 24)>
<12, (18, 2, 14)>
<13, (4, 18, 13)>
<14, (2, 12, 7)>
<15, (8, 25, 15)>
<16, (0, 2, 18)>
<17, (11, 10, 7)>
<18, (5, 20, 12)>
<20, (4, 22, 18)>
<22, (3, 10, 24)>
<23, (9, 6, 5)>
<24, (10, 22, 14)>
<25, (23, 27, 15)>
<26, (9, 29, 4)>
<27, (8, 23, 20)>
<28, (1, 17, 21)>
<29, (26, 29, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
