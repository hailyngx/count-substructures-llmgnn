Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 1) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph. Since each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (10, 13, 2)
- Node 1: (4, 10, 14)
- Node 2: (5, 8, 1)
- Node 3: (5, 9, 13)
- Node 4: (7, 10, 1)
- Node 5: (6, 2, 12)
- Node 6: (5, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (4, 6, 10)
- Node 8: (13, 2, 14)
- Node 9: (14, 3, 5)
- Node 10: (4, 7, 11)
- Node 11: (10)
- Node 12: (5, 10, 8)
- Node 13: (7, 8, 3)
- Node 14: (9, 1, 8)

Based on the node and its neighbors, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (10, 13, 2)>
<1, (4, 10, 14)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 9, 13)>
<4, (7, 10, 1)>
<5, (6, 2, 12)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 10)>
<8, (13, 2, 14)>
<9, (14, 3, 5)>
<10, (4, 7, 11)>
<12, (5, 10, 8)>
<13, (7, 8, 3)>
<14, (9, 1, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
