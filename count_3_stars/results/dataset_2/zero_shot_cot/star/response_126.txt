Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 8) (15, 27) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 13) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 26) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (12, 27) (12, 20) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 0) (28, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 27) (13, 5) (13, 6) (3, 9) (3, 6) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 22) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 7) (2, 25) (22, 27) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 10) (0, 8) (10, 22) (10, 16) (6, 29) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (20, 12) (20, 16) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 23) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 25) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 19) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 19) (25, 15) (25, 2) (25, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and then count them. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (9, 26, 11)>
<2, (4, 17, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 29)>
<4, (17, 14, 18)>
<5, (18, 5, 25)>
<6, (27, 13, 22)>
<7, (11, 8, 1)>
<8, (26, 14, 17)>
<9, (9, 1, 3)>
<10, (22, 2, 21)>
<11, (8, 26, 11)>
<12, (27, 12, 22)>
<13, (22, 2, 23)>
<14, (14, 9, 26)>
<15, (15, 27, 25)>
<16, (5, 18, 16)>
<17, (4, 17, 19)>
<18, (16, 5, 20)>
<19, (21, 19, 23)>
<20, (20, 12, 16)>
<21, (19, 21, 23)>
<22, (22, 27, 2)>
<23, (23, 21, 19)>
<24, (6, 13, 24)>
<25, (25, 18, 2)>
<26, (8, 26, 11)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: [26].
