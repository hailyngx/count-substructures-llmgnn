Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 2), (0, 1)
2. Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 0)
3. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 0)
4. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 8)
5. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 3)
6. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 0)
7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3)
8. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1)
9. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 3)
10. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<1, (9, 7, 6)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<3, (4, 6, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<5, (9, 8, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 8)>
<9, (7, 1, 2)>

So, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
