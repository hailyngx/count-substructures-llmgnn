Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:
- Node 6 is the center of the 3-star <6, (9, 5, 7)>.
- Node 9 is the center of the 3-star <9, (6, 4, 3)>.
- Node 1 is the center of the 3-star <1, (3, 5, 0)>.
- Node 8 is the center of the 3-star <8, (1, 2, 7)>.
- Node 5 is the center of the 3-star <5, (6, 1, 7)>.
- Node 2 is the center of the 3-star <2, (8, 5, 0)>.
- Node 0 is the center of the 3-star <0, (1, 3, 8)>.
- Node 7 is the center of the 3-star <7, (6, 8, 5)>.

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of 8.
So, the answer is [8].
