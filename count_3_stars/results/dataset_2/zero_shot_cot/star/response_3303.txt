Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 13)>
<2, (3, 13, 12)>
<4, (1, 11, 14)>
<6, (3, 8, 7)>
<10, (9, 8, 12)>
