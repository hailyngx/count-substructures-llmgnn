Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 1) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (7, 10) (7, 16) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 19) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 16) (5, 2) (9, 3) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 8, 15)>
<3, (9, 10, 12)>
<10, (7, 11, 17)>
<11, (18, 19, 11)>
<12, (3, 4, 19)>
<18, (13, 19, 6)>
