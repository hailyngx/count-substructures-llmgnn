Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges, as they can potentially be the center of a 3-star:

- Node 6 has 5 edges
- Node 9 has 2 edges
- Node 1 has 2 edges
- Node 3 has 4 edges
- Node 5 has 5 edges
- Node 8 has 4 edges
- Node 7 has 3 edges
- Node 2 has 3 edges
- Node 4 has 5 edges
- Node 0 has 5 edges

Next, we check all the triplets formed by the edges incident on each node with exactly three edges. If the triplet forms a 3-star, we count it. 

Finally, we count the total number of 3-stars found.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (1, 5, 0)>
<6, (1, 5, 4)>
<6, (3, 5, 0)>
<6, (3, 5, 4)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 8, 7)>
<6, (5, 8, 3)>
<6, (5, 0, 2)>
<6, (5, 0, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<6, (8, 1, 5)>
<6, (8, 1, 0)>
<6, (8, 3, 4)>
<6, (7, 3, 5)>
<6, (2, 6, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 0)>
<6, (4, 9, 6)>
<6, (4, 9, 0)>
<6, (4, 3, 0)>
<6, (0, 6, 2)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<9, (6, 4, 0)>
<9, (4, 3, 0)>
<9, (0, 6, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 0)>
<1, (8, 3, 4)>
<3, (5, 8, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (8, 1, 0)>
<5, (8, 0, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 0)>
<8, (1, 0, 7)>
<8, (7, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (6, 4, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 0)>
<4, (3, 0, 2)>
<0, (6, 2, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].
