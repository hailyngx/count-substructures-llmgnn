Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node and three leaves connected to it. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3 (i.e., nodes connected to exactly three other nodes).
2. For each of these nodes, find the three nodes it is connected to.
3. Check if these four nodes form a 3-star pattern.

Let's go through the process:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 4, 3, 5. Since it is connected to 5 nodes, it is not the center of a 3-star.

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 7, 8, 5, 0. Since it is connected to 6 nodes, it is not the center of a 3-star.

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 0, 5. It forms a 3-star <3, (6, 1, 5)>.

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, 5, 1. It forms a 3-star <4, (6, 7, 8)>.

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 3, 8, 2. It forms a 3-star <5, (4, 1, 3)>.

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 2, 4. It forms a 3-star <6, (1, 3, 4)>.

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 2. Since it is connected to only 2 nodes, it is not the center of a 3-star.

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 0, 5. It forms a 3-star <8, (4, 2, 5)>.

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 1. Since it is connected to only 2 nodes, it is not the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found: <3, (6, 1, 5)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 1, 3)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>.
