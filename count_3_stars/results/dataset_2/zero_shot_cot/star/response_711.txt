Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 since the central node of a 3-star must have exactly three edges. From the given edges, nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to node 5.

Next, we identify all unique 3-stars in the graph. Below are the 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 3)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars, which is [3].
