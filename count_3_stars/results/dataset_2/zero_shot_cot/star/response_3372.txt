Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 12)>
<1, (10, 11, 14)>
<2, (7, 12, 13)>
<3, (4, 6, 11)>
<4, (3, 5, 10)>
<6, (3, 7, 13)>
<7, (2, 6, 12)>
<8, (0, 10, 14)>
<9, (5, 8, 13)>

Therefore, the total count of 3-stars is [9].
