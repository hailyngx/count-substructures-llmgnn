Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 12) (15, 21) (15, 11) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 18) (20, 0) (20, 22) (20, 14) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 23) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 25) (5, 11) (6, 29) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 25) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 9) (21, 15) (21, 4) (21, 11) (13, 28) (13, 17) (13, 24) (17, 13) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 22) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 25) (16, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 27) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 16) (10, 3) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 16) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 22) (23, 29) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 29) (27, 19) (2, 23) (2, 7) (7, 2) (7, 14) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 22) (22, 20) (22, 17) (22, 1) (22, 11) (22, 24) (14, 20) (14, 10) (14, 7) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 22) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3 to find potential central nodes:
   - The nodes with degree 3 are nodes: 3, 15, 0, 8, 13, 19, 16, 11, 22, and 24.

2. For each central node, list its connected nodes to form 3-stars:
   - For node 3: (3, 10, 12), (3, 10, 27)
   - For node 15: Not a valid central node
   - For node 0: (0, 16, 20), (0, 18, 9)
   - For node 8: Not a valid central node
   - For node 13: (13, 17, 28), (13, 24, 28)
   - For node 19: (19, 17, 18), (19, 17, 24)
   - For node 16: (16, 0, 12), (16, 0, 25)
   - For node 11: (11, 5, 21), (11, 5, 22)
   - For node 22: (22, 11, 24), (22, 11, 17)
   - For node 24: (24, 13, 19), (24, 13, 22)

<3, (10, 12, 27)>, <0, (16, 20, 18)>, <13, (17, 28, 24)>, <19, (17, 18, 24)>, <16, (0, 12, 25)>, <11, (5, 21, 22)>, <22, (11, 24, 17)> [7]
