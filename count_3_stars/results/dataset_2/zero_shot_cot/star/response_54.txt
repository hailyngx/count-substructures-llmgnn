Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (14, 0) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 12) (18, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 18) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (4, 16) (4, 2) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the list of edges, we can see that the possible central nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now, we will list the 3-stars:

<0, (5, 13, 14)>
<1, (5, 10, 15)>
<2, (4, 16, 17)>
<3, (10, 11, 15)>
<4, (2, 16, 19)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (7, 13, 17)>
<7, (6, 9, 13)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 19)>
<10, (1, 3, 5)>
<11, (3, 8, 16)>
<12, (9, 12, 16)>
<13, (0, 7, 12)>
<14, (0, 16, 19)>
<15, (1, 3, 17)>
<16, (4, 11, 12)>
<17, (2, 6, 15)>
<18, (19, 19, 19)>
<19, (2, 4, 18)>

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars: 20
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20].
