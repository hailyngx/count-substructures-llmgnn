Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 29) (27, 6) (27, 8) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 19) (3, 16) (3, 2) (22, 2) (22, 17) (23, 5) (23, 20) (23, 28) (8, 27) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 9) (6, 27) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 12) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 19) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 14) (29, 15) (29, 25) (29, 24) (19, 1) (19, 28) (19, 9) (2, 3) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 26) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 25) (24, 6) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 5) (14, 20) (14, 9) (26, 0) (5, 23) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 24) (17, 22) (17, 12) (4, 24) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 7) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 18) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 21) (25, 29) (25, 16) (25, 18) (21, 12) (18, 13) (18, 7) (18, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 29.
   - Node 27 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 28.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 16, 2, and 22.
   - Node 23 is connected to nodes 5, 20, and 28.
   - Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 16, and 18.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 5, and 9.
   - Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 9, and 14.
   - Node 29 is connected to nodes 15, 25, and 24.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 22, and 5.
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 15, 16, and 26.
   - Node 17 is connected to nodes 22, 12, and 18.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 24, 9, and 14.
   - Node 21 is connected to nodes 12, 18, and 25.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<15, (1, 0, 29)>
<27, (6, 8, 28)>
<3, (16, 2, 22)>
<23, (5, 20, 28)>
<13, (8, 16, 18)>
<10, (11, 5, 9)>
<11, (10, 9, 14)>
<29, (15, 25, 24)>
<2, (3, 22, 5)>
<0, (15, 16, 26)>
<17, (22, 12, 18)>
<4, (24, 9, 14)>
<21, (12, 18, 25)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
