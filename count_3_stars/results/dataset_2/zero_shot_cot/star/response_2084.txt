Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 5) (2, 7) (2, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since each 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <6, (9, 10, 4)>
- <9, (6, 11, 14)>
- <4, (6, 7, 5)>
- <7, (4, 2, 13)>
- <8, (6, 13, 11)>
- <13, (8, 7, 2)>
- <3, (13, 11, 10)>
- <11, (9, 8, 3)>
- <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- <0, (11, 10, 1)>
- <10, (6, 9, 3)>
- <2, (7, 13, 5)>
- <5, (4, 7, 10)>
- <12, (8, 3, 5)>
- <14, (9, 12, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we find 15 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
