Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (7, 10) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 17) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 19) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 17) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 14) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 5) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 5) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 3) (8, 11) (8, 16) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 14) (18, 0) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 16) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 13) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 14) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors.
2. For each node found in step 1, check if it forms a 3-star pattern.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars formed.

Here are the steps and the final answer:
1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16
2. Check for 3-star patterns for each of these nodes:

<5, (3, 17, 15)>
<8, (11, 16, 19)>
<9, (3, 13, 19)>
<13, (4, 16, 19)>
<14, (6, 10, 18)>
<16, (8, 13, 19)>

3. Final answer: [6]
