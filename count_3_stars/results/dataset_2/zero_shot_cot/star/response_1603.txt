Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Checking the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <4, (8, 9, 13)>
2. <8, (4, 5, 0)>
3. <0, (8, 3, 11)>
4. <14, (6, 3, 13)>
5. <2, (12, 11, 3)>
6. <3, (0, 14, 11)>
7. <11, (0, 2, 9)>
8. <9, (4, 0, 11)>
9. <1, (6, 13, 7)>
10. <6, (4, 14, 11)>
11. <12, (2, 3, 9)>
12. <5, (8, 7, 0)>
13. <7, (8, 1, 5)>
14. <10, (4, 14, 3)>
15. <13, (4, 14, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
