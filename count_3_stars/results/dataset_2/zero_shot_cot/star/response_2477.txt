Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
We will identify all the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify all nodes with degree 3, i.e., nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
Nodes with degree 3: 5, 9, 11, 12

Step 2: For each node with degree 3, identify the 3-stars formed by considering it as the central node and the nodes it is connected to as leaves. In this case, only consider the nodes it is connected to by an edge.

3-stars:
<5, (9, 13, 3)>
<9, (5, 2, 11)>
<11, (9, 10, 1)>
<12, (9, 14, 3)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified.
Total number of 3-stars: 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
