Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three edges and whose neighboring nodes are not connected.

Let's list the nodes and their degrees:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 2
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 6
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars from this information:

<1, (2, 9, 5)>
<4, (3, 8, 6)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in this graph.
