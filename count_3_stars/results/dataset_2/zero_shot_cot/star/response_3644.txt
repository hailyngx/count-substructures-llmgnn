Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 18) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 8) (0, 17) (0, 9) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 19) (5, 3) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 2) (7, 15) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 12) (19, 1) (19, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 14:

- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 6, and 9.

Now, let's list the three-stars centered at node 14:
<14, (17, 6, 9)>
