Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 24) (13, 0) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 21) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 14) (25, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (10, 1) (10, 20) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 26) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 24) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 28) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 28) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 19) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 18) (28, 7) (28, 29) (29, 28) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 15) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 23) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 27) (19, 12) (19, 21) (19, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (27, 1) (23, 18) (23, 24) (23, 4) (20, 10) (20, 2) (20, 12) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 15) (15, 21) (15, 4) (16, 1) (16, 6) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 6) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 26) (11, 5) (11, 25) (11, 26) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star configuration. 

Let's start by listing the potential 3-star configurations:

1. Node 13 with 3 neighbors
2. Node 22 with 3 neighbors
3. Node 5 with 3 neighbors
4. Node 9 with 3 neighbors
5. Node 3 with 2 neighbors (not a 3-star)
6. Node 25 with 2 neighbors (not a 3-star)
7. Node 8 with 2 neighbors (not a 3-star)
8. Node 10 with 2 neighbors (not a 3-star)
9. Node 17 with 2 neighbors (not a 3-star)
10. Node 2 with 4 neighbors (not a 3-star)
11. Node 18 with 3 neighbors
12. Node 7 with 3 neighbors
13. Node 12 with 4 neighbors
14. Node 28 with 4 neighbors
15. Node 29 with 1 neighbor (not a 3-star)
16. Node 21 with 3 neighbors
17. Node 24 with 3 neighbors
18. Node 1 with 4 neighbors
19. Node 19 with 3 neighbors
20. Node 0 with 2 neighbors (not a 3-star)
21. Node 27 with 1 neighbor (not a 3-star)
22. Node 23 with 3 neighbors
23. Node 20 with 3 neighbors
24. Node 4 with 3 neighbors
25. Node 15 with 2 neighbors (not a 3-star)
26. Node 16 with 2 neighbors (not a 3-star)
27. Node 26 with 3 neighbors
28. Node 14 with 3 neighbors
29. Node 6 with 3 neighbors
30. Node 11 with 3 neighbors

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<13, (22, 24, 6)>
<22, (13, 28, 21)>
<5, (9, 2, 11)>
<9, (5, 14, 0)>
<18, (2, 23, 28)>
<7, (8, 12, 28)>
<12, (9, 3, 7)>
<28, (22, 17, 18)>
<21, (22, 19, 15)>
<24, (13, 2, 23)>
<19, (21, 12, 4)>
<23, (18, 24, 4)>
<20, (10, 2, 12)>
<4, (19, 23, 15)>
<26, (17, 11, 6)>
<14, (9, 25, 2)>
<6, (13, 16, 26)>
<11, (5, 25, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
