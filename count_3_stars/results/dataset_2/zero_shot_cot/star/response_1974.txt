Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7. So, we have one 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 7)>
2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. So, we have another 3-star: <7, (4, 6, 9)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9. So, we have one more 3-star: <6, (7, 8, 9)>
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. So, we have another 3-star: <9, (1, 6, 7)>
5. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 9. So, we have another 3-star: <1, (4, 0, 9)>
6. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9. So, we have one more 3-star: <3, (2, 5, 9)>
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6. So, we have another 3-star: <8, (2, 4, 6)>
8. Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 0. So, we have one more 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 0)>
9. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8. So, we have another 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 8)>
10. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. So, we have the final 3-star: <0, (1, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
