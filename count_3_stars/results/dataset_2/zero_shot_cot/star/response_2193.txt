Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 14) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (10, 9) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 10)>
<2, (0, 4, 14)>
<3, (7, 9, 11)>
<4, (0, 5, 12)>
<5, (4, 12, 13)>
<6, (0, 12, 14)>
<7, (1, 3, 12)>
<8, (1, 7, 14)>
<9, (0, 6, 10)>
<11, (3, 8, 13)>
<13, (5, 11, 14)>
<14, (6, 8, 13)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
