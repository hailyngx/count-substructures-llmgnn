Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step. 

1. Start by counting the number of 3-stars in the graph:
   - Each 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves.
   - The central node must be connected to each of the three leaves.
   
2. For each node, identify if it is the central node of a 3-star:
   - Look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors, which are connected through edges. These nodes are potential central nodes of 3-stars.

3. Once you identify the central nodes, check if they are connected to exactly three nodes:
   - Verify if the neighbors of the central node are connected to only the central node. This configuration forms a 3-star.

4. List out the unique 3-stars found:

- The central nodes that have exactly three neighbors are: 5, 9, and 0.
- For node 5: (5, 9, 2) is a 3-star.
- For node 9: (9, 5, 4) is a 3-star.
                   (9, 4, 2) is a 3-star.
   - Please note: (9, 5, 4) and (9, 4, 5) represent the same 3-star since the order of the leaves does not matter.
- For node 0: (0, 5, 3) is a 3-star.
                   (0, 5, 7) is a 3-star.
                   (0, 5, 8) is a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [4] <5, 9, 2>, <9, 5, 4>, <0, 5, 3>, <0, 5, 7>, <0, 5, 8>.
