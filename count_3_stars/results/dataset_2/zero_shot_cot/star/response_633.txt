Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look for each central node connected to three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (4, 7, 10)>
<2, (1, 5, 12)>
<3, (0, 7, 14)>
<4, (1, 7, 13)>
<5, (2, 7, 10)>
<6, (5, 8, 12)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 13)>
<9, (6, 8, 13)>
<10, (5, 7, 12)>
<12, (2, 5, 10)>
<13, (4, 8, 9)>
<14, (3, 7, 13)>

There are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
