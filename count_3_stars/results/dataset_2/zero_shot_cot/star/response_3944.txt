Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes and their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 1
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 4

Next, identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<7, (4, 12, 13)>
<11, (9, 3, 14)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [2]
