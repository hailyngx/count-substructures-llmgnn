Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 6. So, we have one 3-star: <0, (9, 1, 6)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 0. So, we have one 3-star: <1, (7, 6, 0)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and no other third node, so it does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 8. So, we have one 3-star: <3, (7, 6, 8)>
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7. So, we have one 3-star: <4, (5, 9, 7)>
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8. So, we have one 3-star: <5, (9, 6, 8)>
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 1. So, we have one 3-star: <6, (5, 4, 1)>
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 3. So, we have one 3-star: <7, (9, 4, 3)>
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 3. So, we have one 3-star: <8, (5, 1, 3)>
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 0. So, we have one 3-star: <9, (5, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
