Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>
<9, (8, 2, 1)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 2)>
