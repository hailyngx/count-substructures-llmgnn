Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 18) (27, 28) (27, 5) (1, 22) (3, 18) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 4) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 24) (20, 6) (20, 11) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 0) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 23) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 7) (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 16) (22, 1) (22, 20) (22, 7) (21, 19) (21, 8) (21, 24) (11, 20) (11, 23) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 16) (29, 6) (29, 9) (29, 0) (29, 25) (14, 5) (14, 9) (28, 27) (28, 8) (28, 19) (25, 17) (25, 29) (2, 24) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 28) (8, 12) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 29) (0, 12) (18, 15) (18, 3) (16, 9) (16, 23) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 19) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 24) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 2) (24, 4) (19, 6) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 12) (7, 26) (7, 22) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify nodes that are the center of a 3-star. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the central nodes in the graph:

- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 20, 26, 18
- Node 27 has 2 neighbors: 28, 5
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor: 22
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 18
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 17, 26, 12
- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 10, 25, 0, 4
- Node 20 has 5 neighbors: 15, 22, 24, 6, 11
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 27, 6, 8, 14
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 20, 5, 29, 19, 0
- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 26, 4, 23
- Node 26 has 4 neighbors: 15, 10, 13, 7
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 29, 14, 16
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 1, 20, 7
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors: 19, 8
- Node 11 has 2 neighbors: 20, 23
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 13, 11, 16
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 0, 25
- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 27, 8, 19
- Node 25 has 2 neighbors: 17, 29
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 24
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 5, 21, 28, 12
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 17, 6, 29, 12
- Node 18 has 2 neighbors: 15, 3
- Node 16 has 2 neighbors: 9, 23
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 10, 8, 0, 19
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 17, 13, 24
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors: 20, 21, 2, 4
- Node 19 has 4 neighbors: 6, 21, 28, 12
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 26, 22

Let's count the number of 3-stars by examining the central nodes and their neighbors:

[<15, (20, 26, 18)>, <10, (17, 26, 12)>, <17, (10, 25, 0)>, <20, (15, 22, 24)>, <6, (20, 5, 29)>, <26, (15, 10, 13)>, <9, (29, 14, 16)>, <22, (1, 20, 7)>, <11, (20, 23, 11)>, <23, (13, 11, 16)>, <29, (6, 9, 0)>, <8, (5, 21, 28)>, <0, (17, 6, 29)>, <12, (10, 8, 0)>, <24, (20, 21, 2)>, <19, (6, 21, 28)>]

There are a total of [16] 3-star configurations in the given graph.
