Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 5, and 14: <4, (7, 5, 14)>
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 11, and 2: <7, (4, 11, 2)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 2: <6, (1, 3, 2)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 13, and 0: <9, (1, 13, 0)>
5. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 0, and 12: <10, (11, 0, 12)>
6. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 14: <5, (4, 0, 14)>
7. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and 2: <13, (9, 11, 2)>
8. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 8: <12, (10, 11, 8)>
9. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 14: <1, (6, 9, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
