Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (15, 2) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 
Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three edges.

By analyzing the provided list of edges, we can determine the following 3-stars:

<1, (3, 10, 18)>
<2, (11, 15, 19)>
<3, (1, 9, 18)>
<4, (5, 11, 16)>
<5, (4, 12, 18)>
<9, (3, 12, 19)>
<10, (1, 8, 18)>
<11, (2, 16, 17)>
<12, (2, 5, 9)>
<13, (6, 14, 13)>
<15, (2, 7, 17)>
<16, (4, 11, 17)>
<17, (11, 15, 19)>
<18, (1, 3, 5)>
<19, (2, 9, 17)>

As there are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the count of 3-stars is [14].
