Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 21) (5, 16) (9, 21) (9, 28) (1, 3) (1, 25) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 18) (7, 0) (7, 26) (7, 13) (7, 17) (21, 5) (21, 9) (21, 19) (21, 26) (10, 17) (10, 23) (17, 7) (17, 10) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 15) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 25) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 24) (18, 12) (29, 24) (0, 5) (0, 7) (22, 26) (22, 27) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 22) (26, 15) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 27) (27, 22) (27, 25) (27, 20) (27, 6) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 4) (19, 21) (19, 2) (6, 27) (6, 24) (6, 13) (6, 16) (24, 18) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 16) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 24) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 11) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 6) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 27) (20, 14) (20, 28) (28, 9) (28, 20) (14, 20) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes would be potential centers of 3-stars in the graph.

From the given edges, we can find the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 2 neighbors
- Node 10: 2 neighbors
- Node 11: 3 neighbors
- Node 12: 3 neighbors
- Node 13: 3 neighbors
- Node 14: 1 neighbor
- Node 15: 3 neighbors
- Node 16: 3 neighbors
- Node 17: 2 neighbors
- Node 18: 4 neighbors
- Node 19: 2 neighbors
- Node 20: 5 neighbors
- Node 21: 4 neighbors
- Node 22: 2 neighbors
- Node 23: 4 neighbors
- Node 24: 4 neighbors
- Node 25: 3 neighbors
- Node 26: 4 neighbors
- Node 27: 4 neighbors
- Node 28: 2 neighbors
- Node 29: 1 neighbor

Based on the degrees, only nodes 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, and 27 have exactly 3 neighbors, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
<3, (1, 18, 11)>
<5, (4, 0, 21)>
<7, (0, 26, 13)>
<11, (3, 18, 15)>
<12, (2, 18, 4)>
<13, (7, 4, 6)>
<15, (8, 26, 11)>
<16, (5, 24, 6)>
<18, (3, 12, 24)>
<20, (3, 27, 28)>
<21, (5, 19, 26)>
<23, (10, 8, 25)>
<24, (18, 6, 16)>
<26, (7, 21, 15)>
<27, (22, 25, 20)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
