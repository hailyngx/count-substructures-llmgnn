Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with the highest degree in the graph, as these nodes are likely to be the center of the 3-star graphs.

The nodes with the highest degree are:
Node 1: degree = 5
Node 2: degree = 6
Node 3: degree = 5
Node 4: degree = 5
Node 7: degree = 5

Next, we will find all 3-stars in the graph:

There are 2 possible 3-stars with Node 2 as the central node:
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>

There is 1 3-star with Node 4 as the central node:
<4, (0, 5, 6)>

There are 2 possible 3-stars with Node 7 as the central node:
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
