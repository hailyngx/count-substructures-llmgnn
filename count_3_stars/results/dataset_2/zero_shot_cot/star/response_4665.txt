Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 6) (17, 5) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 4) (8, 0) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 11) (3, 16) (3, 6) (11, 12) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3 and its adjacent nodes must not share any edges.
Based on the given edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (8, 1, 16)>
<1, (0, 7, 18)>
<2, (15, 4, 5)>
<3, (16, 6, 11)>
<4, (2, 5, 12)>
<5, (4, 13, 17)>
<6, (17, 13, 3)>
<7, (1, 0, 13)>
<11, (12, 18, 6)>
<12, (15, 4, 11)>
<13, (7, 5, 19)>
<15, (2, 12, 0)>
<16, (0, 3, 19)>
<17, (6, 5, 19)>
<18, (1, 11, 19)>
<19, (13, 16, 18)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Each unique 3-star contributes 1 to the total count.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
