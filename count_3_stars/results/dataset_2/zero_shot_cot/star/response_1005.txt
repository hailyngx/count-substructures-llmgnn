Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and count them. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars present in the graph:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (7, 3, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<8, (4, 6, 0)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[4]
