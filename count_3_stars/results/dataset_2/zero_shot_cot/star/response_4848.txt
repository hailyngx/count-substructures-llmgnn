Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 13, forming a 3-star <4, (8, 12, 13)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 7, forming a 3-star <6, (8, 14, 7)>.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 14, and 3, forming a 3-star <0, (6, 14, 3)>.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 0, forming a 3-star <14, (4, 6, 0)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3, forming a 3-star <2, (5, 9, 3)>.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 10, and 13, forming a 3-star <1, (8, 10, 13)>.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 10, forming a 3-star <9, (2, 11, 10)>.

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
