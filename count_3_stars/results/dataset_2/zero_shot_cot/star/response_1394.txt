Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 20) (26, 14) (26, 25) (26, 8) (1, 2) (1, 24) (21, 0) (21, 18) (21, 29) (15, 27) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 22) (8, 26) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 19) (5, 15) (5, 28) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 23) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 21) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 22) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 19) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 25) (4, 12) (4, 16) (19, 12) (19, 16) (19, 22) (19, 24) (22, 15) (22, 27) (22, 0) (22, 19) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 23) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 14) (25, 28) (20, 9) (20, 24) (29, 21) (10, 5) (10, 2) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 28) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 17) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 28) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 18) (28, 24) 

Response:
First, identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors. These nodes can potentially be the central nodes of 3-star graphs.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20

Next, for each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star graph with their neighbors.

<2, (1, 6, 10)>
<4, (12, 16, 25)>
<5, (15, 10, 28)>
<7, (11, 13, 23)>
<9, (20, 24, 25)>
<10, (5, 2, 28)>
<13, (8, 7, 19)>
<14, (12, 26, 25)>
<16, (0, 4, 19)>
<18, (21, 11, 28)>
<19, (12, 16, 24)>
<20, (9, 24, 25)>
