Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes involved in each 3-star:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Next, let's count the 3-stars using the information above:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)> (1 star)
- Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 8)> (1 star)
- Node 2: <2, (4, 5, 6)> (1 star)
- Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 5)> (1 star)
- Node 5: <5, (0, 2, 4)> (1 star)
- Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 8)> (1 star)
- Node 8: <8, (1, 5, 7)> (1 star)
- Node 9: <9, (4, 6, 8)> (1 star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
