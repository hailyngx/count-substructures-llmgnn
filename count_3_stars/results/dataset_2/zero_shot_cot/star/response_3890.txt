Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (9, 8, 6)>
<4, (7, 14, 6)>
<7, (9, 12, 4)>
<3, (1, 11, 10)>
<6, (5, 4, 10)>
<0, (5, 7, 11)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 4, 13)>
<13, (4, 10, 12)>
<14, (4, 7, 12)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
