Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

The central nodes and their adjacent nodes are as follows:
- Node 6 has 5 adjacent nodes: 9, 3, 2, 8, 4
- Node 9 has 5 adjacent nodes: 6, 8, 10, 1, 0
- Node 4 has 3 adjacent nodes: 6, 8, 11
- Node 7 has 2 adjacent nodes: 12, 8
- Node 10 has 3 adjacent nodes: 9, 2, 5
- Node 11 has 4 adjacent nodes: 4, 14, 0, 8
- Node 8 has 5 adjacent nodes: 6, 9, 4, 7, 11
- Node 12 has 4 adjacent nodes: 7, 13, 1, 3
- Node 14 has 5 adjacent nodes: 11, 3, 1, 13, 5
- Node 2 has 4 adjacent nodes: 6, 10, 11, 0
- Node 5 has 3 adjacent nodes: 10, 14, 0
- Node 0 has 5 adjacent nodes: 9, 11, 2, 5, 13
- Node 3 has 3 adjacent nodes: 6, 12, 14
- Node 1 has 4 adjacent nodes: 9, 12, 14, 13
- Node 13 has 4 adjacent nodes: 12, 14, 0, 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<9, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (6, 8, 11)>
<10, (9, 2, 5)>
<11, (4, 14, 8)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<12, (7, 13, 1)>
<12, (7, 3, 14)>
<14, (11, 1, 13)>
<2, (6, 10, 0)>
<5, (10, 14, 0)>
<0, (9, 2, 5)>
<3, (6, 12, 14)>
<1, (9, 12, 14)>
<13, (12, 14, 1)>

Thus, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
