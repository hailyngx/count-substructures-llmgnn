Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (8, 5) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

[4]

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (12, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 2)>
<9, (11, 14, 13)>
<13, (6, 9, 2)>
