Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5, as these could potentially form 3-stars with node 5 as the center. 

Nodes connected to node 5: {9, 2, 4, 0, 3, 7}

Now, we'll check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars with node 5 as the center:

1. Node 9: {(5, 9, 6), (5, 9, 8), (5, 9, 1)}
2. Node 2: {(5, 2, 1), (5, 2, 3), (5, 2, 6)}
3. Node 4: {(5, 4, 7)}
4. Node 0: {(5, 0, 9), (5, 0, 6), (5, 0, 8)}
5. Node 3: {(5, 3, 6), (5, 3, 2)}
6. Node 7: {(5, 7, 4), (5, 7, 6)}

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<5, 9, (6, 8, 1)>, <5, 2, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, 4, 7>, <5, 0, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, 3, (6, 2)> and <5, 7, (4, 6)>.

Now we count the number of 3-stars: 
Total number of 3-stars = 6 

Therefore, the answer is [6].
