Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes by edges. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <1, (9, 3, 4)>
2. <3, (6, 1, 12)>
3. <4, (1, 14, 11)>
4. <9, (6, 2, 10)>
5. <0, (9, 1, 8)>
6. <11, (4, 7, 14)>
7. <13, (4, 2, 11)>
8. <2, (9, 5, 10)>
9. <5, (6, 3, 7)>
10. <7, (12, 11, 5)>
11. <12, (3, 7, 10)>
12. <14, (4, 8, 11)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [12].
