Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<4, (7, 1, 0)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (4, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (7, 5, 0)>
<5, (7, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 3, 0)>
<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (7, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
