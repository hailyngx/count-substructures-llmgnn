Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star in the given graph. 

From the edges provided, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are present in the graph. 

Next, we will determine all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph inside brackets:
