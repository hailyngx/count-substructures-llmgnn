Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 4.

Now, let's count the 3-stars. Based on the identified nodes, we have the following unique 3-stars:
<5, (4, 3, 9)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>
<8, (9, 5, 2)>
<2, (6, 1, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 2)>
<6, (3, 2, 4)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
