Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Looking at the edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (9, 13, 2)>
- 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (5, 6, 4)>
- 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (5, 9, 7)>
- 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (4, 12, 8)>
- 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (3, 14, 12)>
- 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (1, 13, 2)>
- 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (9, 14, 2)>
- 3-star centered at node 12: <12, (7, 1, 6)>
- 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (5, 3, 6)>
- 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (7, 1, 11)>
- 3-star centered at node 13: <13, (5, 9, 3)>
- 3-star centered at node 11: <11, (4, 12, 14)>
- 3-star centered at node 14: <14, (1, 6, 11)>
- 3-star centered at node 10: <10, (4, 12, 0)>
- 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (9, 12, 11)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [15] of them.
