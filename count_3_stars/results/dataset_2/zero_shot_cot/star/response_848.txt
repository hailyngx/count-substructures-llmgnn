Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star graph. Since a 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges.

From the given edges, we find that nodes 1, 3, 8, and 0 each have 3 incident edges, making them potential center nodes of 3-star graphs.

Next, we need to find the leaves of each 3-star. To do this, we examine the neighbors of each potential center node and see if they form a valid 3-star configuration. 

After examining all possibilities, we find the following unique 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 4, 2)>
- <3, (7, 2, 8)>
- <8, (6, 4, 3)>
- <0, (9, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
