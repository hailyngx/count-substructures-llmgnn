Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 26) (3, 22) (3, 18) (15, 5) (15, 29) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 21) (29, 15) (29, 2) (29, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (18, 3) (18, 12) (28, 16) (28, 17) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 7) (25, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 27) (16, 3) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 23) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 5) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 1) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 20) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 5) (19, 21) (19, 10) (11, 24) (11, 21) (24, 7) (24, 0) (24, 11) (1, 29) (1, 22) (1, 23) (17, 28) (17, 23) (20, 7) (20, 5) (20, 10) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 21) (4, 25) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 5) (10, 19) (10, 20) (10, 14) (27, 7) (27, 9) (23, 16) (23, 1) (23, 17) (21, 2) (21, 19) (21, 11) (21, 14) (21, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to form a possible 3-star structure. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we need to find nodes with a degree of 3 in the given graph.

Nodes with a degree of 3: 3, 2, 29, 21, 12, 23

Now, let's find the edges connected to these nodes:
- Node 3: (3, 16) (3, 26) (3, 22) (3, 18)
- Node 2: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 21)
- Node 29: (29, 15) (29, 2) (29, 1)
- Node 21: (21, 19) (21, 11) (21, 14)
- Node 12: (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18)
- Node 23: (23, 16) (23, 1) (23, 17)

Now, let's construct the 3-stars:
- From node 3: <3, (16, 26, 22)>, <3, (16, 18, 12)>
- From node 2: <2, (29, 22, 26)>, <2, (21, 19, 11)>
- From node 29: <29, (15, 2, 1)>
- From node 21: <21, (19, 11, 14)>
- From node 12: <12, (8, 13, 18)>
- From node 23: <23, (16, 1, 17)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <3, (16, 26, 22)>, <3, (16, 18, 12)>, <2, (29, 22, 26)>, <2, (21, 19, 11)>, <29, (15, 2, 1)>, <21, (19, 11, 14)>
