Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 13) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (4, 3, 13)>
<2, (7, 13, 10)>
<3, (4, 7, 12)>
<4, (1, 3, 11)>
<6, (7, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 10)>
<8, (1, 2, 12)>
<9, (2, 12, 0)>
<10, (5, 7, 8)>
<11, (4, 12, 9)>

By counting these 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
