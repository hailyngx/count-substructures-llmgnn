Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 is the center of a 3-star connected to nodes 5, 9, and 4. <2, (5, 9, 4)>
2. Node 4 is the center of a 3-star connected to nodes 5, 7, and 2. <4, (5, 7, 2)>
3. Node 6 is the center of a 3-star connected to nodes 5, 7, and 1. <6, (5, 7, 1)>
4. Node 8 is the center of a 3-star connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1. <8, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
