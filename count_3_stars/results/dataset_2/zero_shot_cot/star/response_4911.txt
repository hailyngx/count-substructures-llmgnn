Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 11) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. <0, (9, 14, 10)>
2. <1, (7, 4, 11)>
3. <2, (9, 14, 13)>
4. <3, (5, 8, 13)>
5. <4, (6, 13, 10)>
6. <6, (5, 11, 4)>
7. <9, (2, 10, 13)>
8. <10, (9, 0, 4)>
9. <11, (6, 2, 12)>
10. <12, (8, 9, 11)>
11. <13, (5, 9, 14)>
12. <14, (0, 7, 13)>

Count of unique 3-stars: 12
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
