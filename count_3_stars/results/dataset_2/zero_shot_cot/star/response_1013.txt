Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that can act as centers. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the given edges, we can determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5

Nodes 1 and 2 have degree 2, so they cannot be centers of 3-stars. Nodes 6 and 8 have degree 3, making them potential centers. Nodes 0, 3, 5, 7, and 9 have degree 4 or more, so they cannot be centers either.

Let's analyze the connections around nodes 6 and 8 to identify the 3-stars:

- For node 6: (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 2) => <6, (7, 9, 2)>
- For node 8: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 7) => <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 6)> (double count)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
Unique 3-stars: <<6, (7, 9, 2)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)> (or <8, (5, 7, 6)>)]
