Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (5, 0), (9, 0), (1, 0), (4, 0), (8, 0) - <0, (5, 1, 4)>
2. Node 1: (6, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (0, 1) - <1, (6, 3, 4)>
3. Node 2: (8, 2), (6, 2), (1, 2), (4, 2) - <2, (8, 6, 1)>
4. Node 3: (6, 3), (1, 3), (4, 3) - <3, (6, 1, 4)>
5. Node 4: (1, 4), (3, 4), (8, 4), (0, 4), (2, 4) - <4, (1, 3, 8)>
6. Node 5: (9, 5), (0, 5), (7, 5) - <5, (9, 0, 7)>
7. Node 6: (9, 6), (6, 1), (6, 3), (1, 6) - <6, (9, 1, 3)>
8. Node 8: (4, 8), (8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 0) - <8, (4, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
