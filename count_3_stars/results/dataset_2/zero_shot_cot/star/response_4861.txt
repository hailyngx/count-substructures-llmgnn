Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 8) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 17) (0, 17) (0, 19) (14, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 5) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 17) (9, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 9) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars:

<11, (16, 10, 19)>
<16, (11, 3, 6)>
<4, (7, 13, 5)>
<7, (4, 12, 2)>
<10, (11, 18, 8)>
<2, (7, 18, 12)>
<18, (10, 2, 3)>
<12, (7, 2, 17)>
<8, (10, 2, 17)>
<0, (17, 19)>
<14, (13)>
<5, (4, 6, 3)>
<6, (11, 16, 5)>
<1, (15, 13)>
<15, (4, 1, 17)>
<9, (17)>
<19, (11, 0)>
<13, (4, 14, 1)>
<17, (12, 8, 0, 15, 9)>
<3, (16, 18, 12, 5)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: 
[19]
