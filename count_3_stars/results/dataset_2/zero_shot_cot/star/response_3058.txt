Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph.

We have the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<0, (5, 8, 2)>

There are a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the graph.
