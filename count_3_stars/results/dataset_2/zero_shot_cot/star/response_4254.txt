Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 16) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 15) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 13) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 12) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 19) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 10) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 12) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (19, 7) (11, 8) (11, 6) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 18) (10, 16) (10, 9) (4, 13) (4, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (8, 13, 14)>
<2, (6, 7, 16)>
<5, (12, 13, 16)>
<8, (0, 11, 17)>
<13, (0, 5, 17)>
<15, (1, 12, 13)>
<18, (1, 9, 16)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
