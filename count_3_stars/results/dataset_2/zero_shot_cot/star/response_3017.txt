Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 12) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 19) (10, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (5, 1) (5, 19) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 8) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly 3 edges connecting it to other nodes (leaves), forming a 3-star pattern.

I have identified the 3-stars in the graph:

<12, (13, 8, 15)>
<15, (6, 12, 8)>
<6, (9, 15, 7)>
<1, (3, 14, 5)>
<14, (9, 1, 11)>
<0, (19, 16, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
