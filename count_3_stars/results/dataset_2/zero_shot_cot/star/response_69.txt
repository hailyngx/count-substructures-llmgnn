Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (11, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (15, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (19, 17) (19, 14) (19, 16) (19, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

<4, (5, 10, 16)>
<5, (3, 4, 14)>
<7, (2, 8, 18)>
<12, (1, 3, 6)>
<13, (7, 9, 11)>
<14, (3, 5, 15)>
<16, (2, 4, 19)>
<19, (0, 14, 17)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
