Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes with degree 3, as they represent the potential centers of 3-star graphs. Then we need to check each of these nodes to see if they are indeed the center of a 3-star graph.

The nodes with degree 3 in this graph are: 5, 6, 1, 3, 7, and 0.

Let's check each of these nodes to see if they are the center of a 3-star graph:

1. Node 5: (5, 6, 7)
2. Node 6: <6, (5, 9, 7)>
3. Node 1: (1, 9, 3)
4. Node 3: (3, 7, 1)
5. Node 7: <7, (5, 6, 3)>
6. Node 0: (0, 9, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (5, 9, 7)>, 
<7, (5, 6, 3)>,
(1, 9, 3),
(3, 7, 1).
