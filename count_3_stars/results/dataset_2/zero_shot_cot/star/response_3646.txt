Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 9) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 17) (9, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 6) (19, 10) (4, 2) (4, 1) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 11) (15, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (10, 19) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find the central node (center) and its three connected nodes (leaves) for each 3-star. 

Let's start by identifying all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<14, (17, 7, 13)>
<17, (14, 18, 3)>
<18, (17, 2, 15)>
<2, (18, 16, 4)>
<5, (6, 13, 1)>
<6, (5, 19, 8)>
<13, (14, 5, 11)>
<0, (6, 8, -)>
<11, (13, 9, 15)>
<3, (17, 12, -)>
<16, (17, 2, 1)>
<19, (6, 10, -)>
<4, (2, 1, -)>
<15, (18, 11, 12)>
<1, (5, 16, 4)>
<10, (19, -, -)>
<12, (8, 3, 15)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
