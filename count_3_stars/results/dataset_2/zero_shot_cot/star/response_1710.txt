Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are the center of 3-stars. This can be done by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors. 

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 4 (neighbors: 12, 10, 3)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 4, 12, 8)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 4, 10, 8)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 10, 8, 2)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 7, 10, 6)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 11, 13, 5)
- Node 0 (neighbors: 5, 12, 3)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 7, 6, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 8, 0, 14)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 11, 9, 2)

Now, we can construct the 3-stars:

<4, (12, 10, 3)>
<10, (4, 12, 8)>
<12, (4, 10, 8)>
<13, (10, 8, 2)>
<5, (7, 10, 6)>
<6, (11, 13, 5)>
<0, (5, 12, 3)>
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<9, (8, 0, 14)>
<14, (11, 9, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
