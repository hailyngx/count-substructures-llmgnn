Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 4) (6, 18) (6, 16) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 6) (18, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 14) (0, 16) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 3) (12, 16) (12, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 3) (3, 8) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 2) (9, 12) (9, 11) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (8, 13, 17)>
2. <2, (10, 7, 14)>
3. <3, (8, 16, 19)>
4. <4, (13, 5, 19)>
5. <5, (13, 4, 5)>
6. <6, (18, 16, 6)>
7. <7, (2, 10, 14)>
8. <8, (1, 13, 18)>
9. <9, (12, 11, 9)>
10. <10, (15, 2, 16)>
11. <11, (18, 7, 19)>
12. <12, (16, 9, 12)>
13. <13, (1, 15, 4)>
14. <14, (2, 15, 14)>
15. <15, (13, 10, 14)>
16. <16, (6, 0, 3)>
17. <17, (1, 19, 17)>
18. <18, (8, 6, 11)>
19. <19, (4, 11, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
