Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a central node connected to three leaves. Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (5, 1, 6)>
<7, (5, 0, 6)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<8, (9, 5, 2)>
<0, (9, 7, 6)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (4, 7, 0)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
