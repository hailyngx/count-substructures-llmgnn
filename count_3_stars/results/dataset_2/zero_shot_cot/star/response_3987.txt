Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (16, 3) (16, 18) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 13) (9, 0) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 7) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 13) (8, 17) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 
From the given edges, the nodes with degree 3 are: 1, 4, 5, 16, 19.

Next, we can check for each of these nodes and see if they form 3-stars. Let's start with node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes: 6, 7, 9, 15, 17.
- Out of these, 6, 9, and 15 form a 3-star with 1 as the center: <1, (6, 9, 15)>.

Moving on to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to 5 other nodes: 6, 9, 12, 14.
- Out of these, 6, 9, and 14 form a 3-star with 4 as the center: <4, (6, 9, 14)>.

Checking node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes: 14, 15.
- Nodes 14 and 15 are not connected to the same node, so node 5 does not form a 3-star.

Checking node 16:
- Node 16 is connected to 2 other nodes: 3, 18.
- Nodes 3 and 18 are not connected to the same node, so node 16 does not form a 3-star.

Checking node 19:
- Node 19 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 9, 17, 19.
- Out of these, 0, 9, and 19 form a 3-star with 19 as the center: <19, (0, 9, 19)>.

After evaluating all the potential center nodes, we found a total of 2 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [2].
