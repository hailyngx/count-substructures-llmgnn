Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<4, (6, 9, 11)>
<7, (6, 11, 10)>
<10, (7, 11, 0)>
<11, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (10, 8, 1)>
<8, (11, 2, 5)>
<3, (4, 11, 0)>
<1, (6, 2, 5)>
<0, (10, 2, 8)>
<5, (8, 1, 14)>
<14, (9, 10, 8)>
<12, (11, 1)>
<13, (7, 10, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
