Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars by looking for the nodes that are connected in the form of a 3-star. Then we will simply count the unique 3-stars identified. 

By analyzing the edges provided, we can find the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (13, 7, 9)>
<1, (13, 4, 14)>
<3, (8, 2, 12)>
<4, (11, 5, 9)>
<5, (11, 8, 6)>
<6, (8, 5, 2)>
<9, (11, 8, 4)>
<13, (8, 0, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [8].
