Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 15) (21, 14) (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 19) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 6) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 3) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 19) (20, 3) (20, 19) (20, 28) (20, 10) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 28) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 17) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 14) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 9) (25, 2) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 9) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (17, 26) (17, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) (3, 8) (3, 20) (3, 9) (14, 21) (14, 27) (14, 13) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 12) (12, 11) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, we notice that the graph contains a 3-star if a node has exactly 3 adjacent edges. 

After examining the given edges, we find the following nodes with exactly 3 adjacent edges:
- Node 2: (2, 29), (2, 11), (2, 25)
- Node 4: (4, 27), (4, 5), (4, 16)
- Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, -)
- Node 6: (6, 22), (6, 23), (6, 28)
- Node 7: (7, 29), (7, 19), (7, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 10), (9, 25), (9, 7)
- Node 11: (11, 2), (11, 8), (11, 18)
- Node 13: (13, 28), (13, 9), (13, 14)
- Node 14: (14, 21), (14, 27), (14, 13)
- Node 15: (15, 21), (15, 8), (15, 19)
- Node 16: (16, 4), (16, 10), (16, -)
- Node 17: (17, 26), (17, 0), (17, -)
- Node 18: (18, 10), (18, 11), (18, -)
- Node 20: (20, 3), (20, 19), (20, 28)
- Node 21: (21, 1), (21, 27), (21, 15)
- Node 22: (22, 23), (22, 6), (22, -)
- Node 23: (23, 22), (23, 25), (23, 6)
- Node 25: (25, 2), (25, 23), (25, 27)
- Node 26: (26, 24), (26, 17), (26, -)
- Node 27: (27, 21), (27, 4), (27, 25)
- Node 29: (29, 2), (29, 7), (29, 19)

Now, we identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (27, 5, 16)>
<6, (22, 23, 28)>
<9, (10, 25, 7)>
<11, (2, 8, 18)>
<13, (28, 9, 14)>
<16, (4, 10, -)>
<17, (26, 0, -)>
<18, (10, 11, -)>
<22, (23, 6, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
