Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<4, (6, 0, 1)>
<7, (9, 6, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (9, 7, 2)>
<2, (9, 6, 3)>

Thus, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [10].
