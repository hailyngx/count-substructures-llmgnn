Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (1, 29) (1, 7) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 22) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 23) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 6) (26, 6) (29, 1) (28, 3) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 2) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 7) (2, 17) (2, 28) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 16) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (25, 27) (27, 2) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 23) (4, 22) (4, 12) (12, 28) (12, 22) (12, 4) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 23) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 18) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 15) (7, 9) (21, 27) (21, 9) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 2) (20, 14) (20, 9) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 20) (6, 11) (6, 26) (18, 17) (18, 0) (23, 14) (23, 13) (23, 27) (23, 19) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's start by looking at each node and counting the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center. 

Parsing through the edges, we find the following 3-stars:

1. <1, (7, 29, 3)>
2. <2, (17, 22, 28)>
3. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
4. <4, (12, 22, 27)>
5. <5, (3, 11, 27)>
6. <6, (11, 26, 12)>
7. <7, (1, 9, 15)>
8. <8, (13, 19, 22)>
9. <9, (7, 15, 20)>
10. <10, (11, 14, 24)>
11. <11, (6, 10, 28)>
12. <12, (4, 22, 28)>
13. <13, (8, 19, 23)>
14. <14, (10, 20, 23)>
15. <15, (7, 9, 19)>
16. <16, (2, 10, 17)>
17. <17, (2, 16, 18)>
18. <18, (0, 17, 19)>
19. <19, (13, 15, 23)>
20. <20, (9, 14, 29)>
21. <21, (9, 27, 7)>
22. <22, (2, 12, 22)>
23. <23, (13, 14, 27)>
24. <24, (0, 10, 24)>
25. <25, (27, 25, 23)>
26. <26, (11, 6, 23)>
27. <27, (2, 21, 25)>
28. <28, (3, 11, 12)>
29. <29, (1, 20, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
