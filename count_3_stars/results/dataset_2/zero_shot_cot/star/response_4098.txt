Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars formed by considering each such node as the center.
3. Output the total count inside brackets [ ].

Let's go through the edges to identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3 (connected to exactly three other nodes) are: 5, 9, 0, 11, 3, 10, 8, 14.

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<9, (5, 14, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 10)>
<11, (5, 10, 4)>
<3, (5, 1, 14)>
<10, (11, 0, 8)>
<8, (1, 10, 12)>
<14, (5, 9, 13)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
