Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 1, as these could potentially form 3-stars.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 12, and 14.

Next, let's check which of these nodes, when taken as the center, form 3-stars.
- Node 1 as the central node: (1, 2, 7), (1, 12, 14)
- Node 2 as the central node: (2, 1, 4)
- Node 3 as the central node: (3, 0, 13)
- Node 7 as the central node: (7, 1, 11)
- Node 12 as the central node: (12, 1, 8)
- Node 14 as the central node: (14, 5, 6)

Therefore, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
So, the final answer is [6].
