Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Based on the given edges, we can see that the following nodes have degree 3:
   - Node 4 (connected to 5, 7, 8)
   - Node 13 (connected to 5, 7, 8)
   
2. Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed around nodes 4 and 13:
   - For node 4, the 3-star is <4, (5, 7, 8)>
   - For node 13, the 3-star is <13, (5, 7, 8)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
