Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 8) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (16, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 6) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 13) (3, 2) (3, 6) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 19) (18, 6) (13, 0) (13, 19) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given list of edges, we can identify the unique 3-stars:

- <0, (9, 7, 13)>
- <1, (14, 15, 16)>
- <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- <3, (2, 6, 18)>
- <4, (5, 6, 12)>
- <5, (2, 4, 17)>
- <6, (3, 4, 18)>
- <7, (8, 9, 19)>
- <8, (7, 15, 17)>
- <9, (0, 8, 12)>
- <11, (6, 9, 19)>
- <12, (4, 9, 11)>
- <14, (1, 7, 19)>
- <15, (1, 8, 17)>
- <16, (1, 19, 5)>
- <17, (4, 5, 8)>
- <18, (3, 6, 2)>
- <19, (7, 11, 13)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
