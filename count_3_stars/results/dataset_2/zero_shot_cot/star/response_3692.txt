Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars:

1. First, we can identify the central node of each potential 3-star. A central node is a node with exactly three neighbors since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Next, we will identify the neighbors for each central node. We will check if the neighbors are distinct and if the relationship forms a 3-star structure.

3. Finally, we will count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start analyzing the graph for 3-stars:

In the given graph, we have the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 3, 4)>
<9, (5, 1, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 1, 0)>
<6, (5, 3, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 8, 7)>
<7, (9, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
