Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

<0, (9, 10, 13)>
<1, (5, 11, 13)>
<2, (3, 7, 10)>
<3, (2, 7, 12)>
<4, (5, 7, 14)>
<5, (1, 4, 12)>
<6, (1, 7, 14)>
<7, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 10, 13)>
<9, (0, 1, 14)>
<10, (0, 2, 12)>
<11, (1, 4, 13)>
<12, (3, 5, 10)>
<13, (1, 8, 11)>
<14, (4, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-star patterns, we find that there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
