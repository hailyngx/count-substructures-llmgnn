Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 5 is connected to 6, 13, and 8.
   - Node 6 is connected to 5, 9, and 7.
   - Node 1 is connected to 5, 3, and 4.
   - Node 3 is connected to 1, 11, and 7.
   - Node 8 is connected to 5, 9, and 7.
   - Node 13 is connected to 5, 2, and 14.
   - Node 2 is connected to 13, 10, and 0.
   - Node 4 is connected to 1, 12, and 14.
   - Node 7 is connected to 5, 6, and 1.
   - Node 14 is connected to 9, 1, and 4.

2. Unique 3-stars found:
   - <5, (6, 13, 8)>
   - <6, (5, 9, 7)>
   - <1, (5, 3, 4)>
   - <3, (1, 11, 7)>
   - <8, (5, 9, 7)>
   - <13, (5, 2, 14)>
   - <2, (13, 10, 0)>
   - <4, (1, 12, 14)>
   - <7, (5, 6, 1)>
   - <14, (9, 1, 4)>

3. Count of 3-stars: [10]
