Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (2, 9, 0)>
<3, (0, 9, 5)>
<4, (9, 5, 2)>
<8, (2, 9, 6)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<6, (8, 2, 7)>

Now, count the number of 3-stars: [6].
