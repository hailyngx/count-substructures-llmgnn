Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 19) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 13) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 15) (20, 21) (20, 22) (20, 24) (21, 20) (21, 25) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 14) (7, 25) (7, 18) (7, 26) (25, 17) (25, 21) (25, 7) (25, 22) (25, 14) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 27) (19, 9) (19, 28) (13, 29) (13, 27) (26, 5) (26, 7) (26, 23) (0, 10) (0, 22) (10, 1) (10, 0) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 29) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 4) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 22) (14, 2) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 6) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 2) (6, 23) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 6) (23, 12) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 0) (22, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 23) (12, 4) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 27) (27, 8) (27, 13) (27, 18) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like manner. 

Let's go through the graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 26, and 4: <5, (9, 26, 4)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 16, and 19: <9, (5, 16, 19)>
3. Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 21, and 22: <25, (7, 21, 22)>
4. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 10, and 23: <1, (17, 10, 23)>
5. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 15: <17, (1, 6, 15)>
6. Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 22, and 24: <20, (21, 22, 24)>
7. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 24, 18, and 4: <11, (24, 18, 4)>
8. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 24, and 2: <6, (17, 24, 2)>
9. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 23, 4, and 6: <12, (23, 4, 6)>
10. Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 11, and 27: <18, (7, 11, 27)>
11. Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 13, and 18: <27, (8, 13, 18)>
12. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 27, and 19: <13, (29, 27, 19)>
13. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 25, and 22: <14, (15, 25, 22)>

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [13].
