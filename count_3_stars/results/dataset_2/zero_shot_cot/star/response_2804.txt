Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (5, 12, 13)>
2. <1, (8, 2, 7)>
3. <3, (9, 12, 13)>
4. <4, (5, 10, 13)>
5. <5, (9, 4, 12)>
6. <6, (8, 12, 14)>
7. <7, (10, 3, 6)>
8. <8, (9, 10, 1)>
9. <9, (5, 8, 13)>
10. <10, (4, 8, 7)>
11. <11, (0, 2, 13)>
12. <12, (5, 0, 6)>
13. <13, (9, 4, 11)>
14. <14, (5, 4, 6)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the answer is [14].
