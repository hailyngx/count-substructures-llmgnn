Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The given connections are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 6, 14, 5, and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 13, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 10.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10 and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 12, and 11.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 0, and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 0, and 10.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 10, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 11, 14, 10, and 1.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 3, 8, 12, and 2.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, 11, and 10.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 0, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 0, and 13.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (7, 6, 14)>
2. <1, (9, 8, 13)>
3. <10, (7, 9, 12)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
