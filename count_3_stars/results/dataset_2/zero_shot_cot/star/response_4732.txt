Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 13) (18, 19) (18, 10) (22, 2) (22, 21) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 2) (12, 27) (12, 28) (8, 26) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 14) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 11) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (6, 21) (6, 10) (6, 26) (6, 4) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 6) (21, 29) (29, 20) (29, 21) (29, 5) (29, 10) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (2, 22) (2, 25) (2, 16) (19, 18) (19, 20) (19, 28) (16, 2) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 26) (7, 17) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 9) (5, 25) (5, 29) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 4) (3, 14) (24, 17) (24, 28) (14, 23) (14, 3) (26, 8) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 29) (10, 7) (1, 7) (1, 13) (17, 23) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 24) (13, 0) (13, 27) (13, 9) (13, 1) (28, 12) (28, 19) (28, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with degree 3 are: 19, 20, 25, and 29.

Now, let's find the 3-stars involving these nodes:
- For node 19: <19, (18, 20, 28)>
- For node 20: <20, (3, 15, 29)>, <20, (19, 25, 5)>, <20, (25, 15, 29)>
- For node 25: <25, (2, 20, 5)>, <25, (5, 20, 29)>
- For node 29: <29, (6, 21, 20)>, <29, (10, 20, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
