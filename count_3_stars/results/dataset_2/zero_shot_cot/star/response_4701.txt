Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 15) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 13) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 16) (18, 11) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 2) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 16) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 8) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 4) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 11) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars step by step:

1. Nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 10, 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 17.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 15, 17.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 12, 16, 19.

2. Counting the 3-stars:
- 3-stars centered at node 4: <4, (2, 10, 14)>
- 3-stars centered at node 6: <6, (10, 11, 17)>
- 3-stars centered at node 12: <12, (7, 15, 17)>
- 3-stars centered at node 15: <15, (12, 16, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
