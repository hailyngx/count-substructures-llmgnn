Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present.

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (8, 3, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 1)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<7, (8, 9, 5)>
<1, (8, 6, 5)>
<6, (4, 0, 1)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 0, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
