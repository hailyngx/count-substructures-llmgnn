Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 19) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 5) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 8, 11)>, <1, (3, 15, 13)>, <2, (10, 18, 11)>, <3, (1, 6, 5)>, <4, (17, 19, 14)>, <5, (3, 7, 5)>, <6, (3, 8, 13)>, <7, (18, 19, 5)>, <8, (9, 0, 6)>, <9, (8, 16, 13)>, <10, (2, 14, 16)>, <11, (17, 18, 0)>, <12, (14, 11, 12)>, <13, (15, 9, 6)>, <14, (10, 4, 19)>, <15, (1, 13, 15)>, <16, (10, 9, 16)>, <17, (19, 11, 4)>, <18, (7, 2, 11)>, <19, (17, 7, 14)>.

Hence, there are [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
