Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 14) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 9) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 0) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 8) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (15, 11) (15, 2) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (12, 4) (6, 19) (6, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 10) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 4) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as follows:
<3, (1, 9, 16)>
<19, (5, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
