Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 8) (2, 7) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 13) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (19, 16) (19, 6) (12, 17) (12, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 19) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 12) (16, 10) (16, 19) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 6, and 18: <14, (17, 6, 18)>
2. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 1, and 12: <17, (14, 1, 12)>
3. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 4, and 16: <10, (11, 4, 16)>
4. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 0, and 13: <11, (10, 0, 13)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 3: <5, (4, 0, 3)>
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 15, and 19: <6, (14, 15, 19)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
