Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the node 7 to find potential 3-stars that have node 7 as the central node:
- Node 5, 6, 8, 9 are connected to node 7.

Next, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star with node 7 as the central node:
1. Node 5: (5, 7, 6), (5, 7, 8) - This creates 2 unique 3-stars.
2. Node 6: (6, 7, 4), (6, 7, 1), (6, 7, 5), (6, 7, 8) - This creates 4 unique 3-stars.
3. Node 8: (8, 7, 1), (8, 7, 5), (8, 7, 6), (8, 7, 2) - This creates 4 unique 3-stars.
4. Node 9: (9, 7, 1), (9, 7, 2) - This creates 2 unique 3-stars.

Combining all the unique 3-stars found for each potential central node, we get the 3-stars as follows: 
<5, (7, 6, 8)>, <6, (7, 4, 1)>, <6, (7, 5, 8)>, <8, (7, 1, 5)>, <8, (7, 6, 2)>, <9, (7, 1, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
