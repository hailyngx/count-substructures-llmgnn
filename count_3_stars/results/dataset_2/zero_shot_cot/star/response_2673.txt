Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-star configurations. Since each 3-star has a unique central node, we will list the possible 3-stars considering each node as the center.

1. Starting with node 0:
   <0, (4, 5, 6)>

2. Moving to node 1:
   <1, (3, 7, 9)>

3. Considering node 2:
   <2, (4, 5, 7)>

4. Moving on to node 3:
   <3, (1, 5, 9)>

5. Examining node 4:
   <4, (0, 5, 8)>
   <4, (2, 5, 6)>
   <4, (8, 5, 9)>
   <4, (6, 5, 5)>

6. Moving to node 5:
   <5, (3, 4, 0)>
   <5, (1, 4, 8)>
   <5, (0, 4, 6)>
   <5, (4, 4, 2)>
   <5, (6, 4, 7)>

7. Considering node 6:
   <6, (4, 0, 5)>

8. Moving on to node 7:
   <7, (1, 8, 9)>
   <7, (2, 5, 7)>

9. Examining node 8:
   <8, (4, 0, 7)>
   <8, (4, 7, 9)>
   <8, (0, 8, 7)>

10. Considering node 9:
    <9, (1, 4, 7)>
    <9, (2, 7, 9)>
    <9, (4, 8, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(1) + (1) + (1) + (1) + (4) + (5) + (1) + (2) + (3) = 19]. Therefore, the answer is [19].
