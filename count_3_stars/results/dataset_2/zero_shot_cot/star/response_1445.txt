Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 19) (1, 17) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 11) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

[(Get the nodes connected to each node)]
- Node 0: (4, 13, 16)
- Node 1: (17)
- Node 2: (4, 6, 10, 16)
- Node 3: (7, 14)
- Node 4: (0, 2, 7)
- Node 5: (7, 18, 19)
- Node 6: (2, 12)
- Node 7: (3, 4, 5, 14)
- Node 8: (9, 11, 13, 15)
- Node 9: (8, 11, 12)
- Node 10: (2, 18)
- Node 11: (8, 9, 14)
- Node 12: (6, 9, 16, 19)
- Node 13: (0, 8, 19)
- Node 14: (3, 7, 11, 19)
- Node 15: (8, 18)
- Node 16: (0, 2, 12)
- Node 17: (1, 19)
- Node 18: (5, 10, 15)
- Node 19: (5, 12, 13, 14, 17)

[Count the 3-stars]
From the list above, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<2, (4, 6, 16)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (9, 11, 13)>
<9, (8, 11, 12)>
<10, (2, 18, 5)>
<11, (8, 9, 14)>
<12, (6, 9, 16)>
<13, (8, 13, 19)>
<14, (3, 11, 7)>
<15, (8, 18, 5)>
<16, (0, 2, 12)>
<17, (1, 19, 5)>

[Total number of 3-stars: 12] 
Therefore, the final answer is [12] <2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17>.
