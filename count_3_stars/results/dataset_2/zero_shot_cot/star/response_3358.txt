Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 5: <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and 9: <6, (1, 8, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
