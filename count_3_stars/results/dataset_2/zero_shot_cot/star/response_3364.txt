Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 12) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 15) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 15) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 10) (4, 0) (4, 15) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 17) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 18) (7, 11) (7, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 10) (18, 17) (10, 19) (10, 18) (17, 5) (17, 12) (17, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. Nodes with connections to exactly three other nodes satisfy the property of being a center of a 3-star.

The nodes with 3 connections are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19.

Now, for each of these nodes, let's find the 3-star configurations:

- Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (13, 11, 15)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 15, 17)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 17, 19)>
- Node 6: <6, (11, 18, 1)>
- Node 8: <8, (13, 19, 15)>
- Node 11: <11, (7, 16, 6)>
- Node 12: <12, (1, 17, 16)>
- Node 13: <13, (15, 8, 2)>
- Node 15: <15, (13, 8, 4)>
- Node 19: <19, (5, 8, 10)>

There are 11 unique 3-star configurations. So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
