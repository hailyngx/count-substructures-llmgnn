Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 27) (0, 10) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 17) (27, 13) (20, 22) (17, 27) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 27) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 4) (18, 17) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 25) (26, 18) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 16) (8, 5) (1, 24) (15, 26) (15, 21) (15, 28) (19, 18) (19, 2) (25, 18) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 14) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 22) (10, 14) (3, 24) (3, 22) (28, 15) (28, 25) (28, 7) (11, 26) (11, 24) (11, 21) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 13) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 24) (23, 5) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 21) (2, 19) (2, 16) (4, 29) (4, 25) (4, 23) (4, 16) (12, 10) (12, 13) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 12) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 25) (14, 10) (14, 23) (16, 26) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 6) (22, 20) (22, 10) (22, 3) (21, 15) (21, 11) (21, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

Node 5: (9, 23, 8, 10)
Node 9: (5, 27)
Node 27: (9, 29, 17, 13)
Node 17: (27, 29, 18)
Node 29: (27, 17, 7, 4)
Node 18: (17, 26, 19, 6)
Node 26: (18, 15, 11, 16)
Node 8: (5)
Node 1: (24)
Node 15: (26, 21, 28)
Node 19: (18, 2)
Node 25: (18, 4, 28, 14)
Node 10: (5, 0, 12, 22, 14)
Node 3: (24, 22)
Node 28: (15, 25, 7)
Node 11: (26, 24, 21)
Node 24: (1, 3, 11, 7, 13)
Node 7: (29, 28, 24)
Node 23: (5, 4, 14, 21)
Node 2: (19, 16)
Node 4: (29, 25, 23, 16)
Node 12: (10, 13)
Node 13: (27, 24, 12)
Node 6: (18, 16)
Node 14: (25, 10, 23)
Node 16: (26, 2, 4, 6)
Node 20: (22)
Node 21: (15, 11, 23)

Now, let's count how many 3-stars exist in this graph:

In this graph, we have the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 23, 8)>
<5, (9, 23, 10)>
<5, (9, 8, 10)>
<9, (5, 23, 27)>
<9, (5, 8, 27)>
<9, (5, 10, 27)>
<27, (9, 29, 17)>
<27, (9, 17, 13)>
<27, (29, 17, 13)>
<17, (27, 29, 18)>
<29, (27, 17, 7)>
<29, (27, 17, 4)>
<29, (17, 7, 4)>
<18, (17, 26, 19)>
<26, (17, 15, 11)>
<26, (18, 15, 16)>
<8, (5, 23, 8)>
<15, (26, 21, 28)>
<19, (18, 2, 19)>
<25, (18, 4, 25)>
<10, (5, 0, 10)>
<3, (24, 22, 3)>
<28, (25, 7, 28)>
<11, (26, 24, 11)>
<24, (7, 24, 13)>
<7, (29, 24, 7)>
<23, (5, 4, 23)>
<2, (19, 16, 2)>
<4, (29, 23, 4)>
<12, (10, 13, 12)>
<6, (18, 16, 6)>
<14, (25, 23, 14)>
<16, (26, 4, 16)>
<20, (22, 20)>
<21, (11, 23, 21)>

Therefore, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in this graph.
