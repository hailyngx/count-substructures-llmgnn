Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 19) (15, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (21, 3) (21, 7) (21, 14) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 28) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 4) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 6) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 16) (28, 10) (28, 12) (29, 26) (20, 17) (20, 12) (20, 18) (17, 23) (17, 20) (17, 26) (2, 13) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 25) (24, 11) (24, 27) (24, 9) (9, 24) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 19) (18, 20) (18, 9) (18, 27) (18, 12) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 27) (5, 22) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 12) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 1) (27, 26) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 14) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (0, 9) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 27) (25, 10) (25, 16) (25, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 25) (6, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (11, 19, 27)>
<2, (13, 6, 14)>
<3, (19, 21, 9)>
<4, (8, 11, 14)>
<5, (8, 12, 22)>
<6, (13, 14, 23)>
<7, (16, 21, 8)>
<9, (18, 19, 24)>
<10, (11, 15, 28)>
<12, (14, 18, 20)>
<13, (2, 6, 14)>
<14, (13, 22, 4)>
<16, (7, 8, 25)>
<18, (9, 12, 27)>
<19, (1, 3, 9)>
<21, (3, 7, 14)>
<22, (5, 6, 14)>
<24, (11, 18, 27)>
<25, (6, 16, 10)>
<26, (17, 27, 29)>
<27, (1, 18, 26)>
<28, (10, 12, 29)>
<29, (26, 28, 29)>

Count of 3-stars: [23]
