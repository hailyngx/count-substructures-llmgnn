Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 0) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each central node (center) and its three connected neighbors. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 4, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 11)>
<6, (9, 10, 4)>
<1, (3, 11, 13)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (6, 3, 13)>
<13, (1, 8, 4)>
<2, (14, 11, 2)>
<0, (7, 10, 11)>
<14, (5, 7, 2)>
<11, (9, 1, 3)>
<7, (3, 13, 14)>
<10, (9, 6, 0)>
<12, (5, 8, 14)>
<4, (5, 6, 13)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [15]
