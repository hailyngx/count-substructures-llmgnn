Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 9) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 14), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 9)
Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 13), (3, 5), (3, 8)
Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 5), (7, 13), (7, 8)
Node 12: (12, 4), (12, 5), (12, 11), (12, 9)
Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 10), (4, 6)
Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 13)
Node 10: (10, 4), (10, 2)
Node 2: (2, 10), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 14), (2, 11)
Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 12), (9, 2), (9, 11)
Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 12)
Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 2), (6, 13)
Node 14: (14, 1), (14, 2)
Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 7), (8, 11)
Node 13: (13, 3), (13, 7), (13, 4), (13, 0), (13, 6), (13, 11)
Node 11: (11, 12), (11, 2), (11, 9), (11, 8), (11, 13)

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 14)>
<3, (0, 8, 13)>
<7, (5, 8, 13)>
<12, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (10, 12, 6)>
<0, (3, 13, -)>
<10, (2, 4, -)>
<2, (6, 9, 14)>
<9, (1, 7, 12)>
<5, (1, 7, 12)>
<6, (2, 4, 13)>
<14, (1, 2, -)>
<8, (3, 7, 11)>
<13, (0, 6, 11)>
<11, (8, 9, 13)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we get: [14].
