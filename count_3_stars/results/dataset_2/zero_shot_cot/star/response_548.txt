Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node (center) and its adjacent nodes (leaves) in each 3-star configuration.

Let's analyze the graph:

The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's list the edges with their nodes in a more structured way:

Node 0: 5, 9, 4, 1, 2
Node 1: 4, 7, 6, 0
Node 2: 9, 3, 8, 0
Node 3: 5, 6, 2
Node 4: 5, 0, 1
Node 5: 6, 4, 0, 3, 7
Node 6: 5, 7, 1, 3, 8
Node 7: 5, 6, 1, 8
Node 8: 9, 7, 2, 6
Node 9: 8, 2, 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are 3-stars centered at nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<5, (3, 7, 6)>
<6, (5, 8, 7)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (9, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
