Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 5) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 14) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 15) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 11) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 18) (3, 0) (14, 15) (14, 13) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 1) (13, 18) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3. 

The nodes with degree 3 are: 6, 9, 17, 7, 8, 19, 4, 5, 11, 12, 0, 15, 16, 18. 

Now, let's list the 3-stars within the graph:

<6, (9, 17, 0)>  
<9, (6, 17, 4)>  
<17, (6, 9, 16)>  
<7, (10, 12, 8)>  
<8, (7, 19, 1)>  
<19, (7, 8, 15)>  
<4, (9, 12, 5)>  
<5, (17, 4, 11)>  
<11, (4, 5, 12)>  
<12, (7, 11, 4)>  
<0, (6, 15, 3)>  
<15, (8, 19, 0)>  
<16, (17, 18, 1)>  
<18, (17, 16, 13)>

So, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
