Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (22, 29) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 28) (9, 20) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 24) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 21) (15, 11) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 27) (1, 7) (8, 23) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 26) (18, 6) (18, 24) (18, 12) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 29) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 7) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 11) (12, 18) (12, 14) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 24) (17, 20) (17, 4) (21, 3) (21, 15) (21, 23) (21, 14) (16, 13) (16, 24) (11, 15) (11, 7) (24, 3) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 16) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 6) (28, 5) (28, 10) (0, 15) (0, 1) (29, 13) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 26) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 21) (14, 27) (27, 1) (27, 14) (27, 6) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 25) (6, 27) (4, 5) (4, 23) (4, 17) (10, 13) (10, 23) (10, 28) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 26, and 7: <1, (3, 26, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 4, and 28: <5, (25, 4, 28)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 0, and 11: <15, (20, 0, 11)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 6, and 12: <18, (26, 6, 12)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 4, and 21: <23, (8, 4, 21)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 18, and 19: <24, (3, 18, 19)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 22, and 26: <29, (13, 22, 26)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
