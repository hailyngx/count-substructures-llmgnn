Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 0) (15, 3) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (14, 19) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 10, 15
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 17, 18
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 11, 19
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 6, 12, 16
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 4, 12, 13, 18
- Node 12 has 4 neighbors: 9, 10, 16, 19
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors: 3, 4
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors: 9, 11, 12, 18
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 10, 16
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 8, 12, 14

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (5, 10, 15)>.
- Node 5 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (6, 12, 16)>.
- Node 10 forms 1 3-star: <10, (4, 12, 18)>.
- Node 12 forms 1 3-star: <12, (9, 10, 16)>.
- Node 15 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 16 forms 1 3-star: <16, (9, 12, 18)>.
- Node 18 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 19 forms 0 3-stars.

Combining all the counts together, we have counted a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
