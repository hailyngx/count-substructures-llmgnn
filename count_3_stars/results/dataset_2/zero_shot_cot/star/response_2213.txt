Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (5, 6) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 2) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 9, and 2.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 2.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 0, and 12.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 12.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 6.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 11, and none (which we can ignore as it does not form a 3-star).

2. Determine the 3-stars in the graph:
From the identified nodes, we can see the following unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 13, 0)>
<7, (4, 11, 6)>
<1, (11, 14, 13)>
<6, (7, 9, 5)>
<3, (10, 9, 2)>
<0, (4, 14, 2)>
<14, (4, 1, 0)>
<2, (3, 0, 12)>
<8, (1, 14, 12)>
<13, (4, 1, 14)>
<12, (2, 8, 13)>
<11, (7, 1, 6)>
<10, (3, 6, 14)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars:
We have found 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the answer is: [13]
