Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<2, (6, 9, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (4, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 9, 4)>
<7, (1, 7, 5)>
<8, (1, 8, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 4)>
<0, (7, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
