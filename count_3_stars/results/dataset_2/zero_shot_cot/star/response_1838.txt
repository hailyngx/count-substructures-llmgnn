Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
3. Count the number of such 3-stars in the graph.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:
- Nodes 5, 4, 7, 6, 1, and 8 are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Let's count all possible 3-stars with these nodes as centers:

Possible 3-stars:
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<8, (9, 3, 5)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
