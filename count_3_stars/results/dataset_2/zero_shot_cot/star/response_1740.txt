Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 
A 3-star would consist of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We can see the following 3-star structures:
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
<7, (4, 0, 2)>
<6, (9, 4, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<8, (5, 7, 6)>
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<3, (6, 2, *)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>

As a result, there are [<6>] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
