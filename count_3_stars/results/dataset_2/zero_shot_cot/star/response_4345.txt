Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 16) (12, 1) (12, 7) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 13) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 18) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 5) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 15) (18, 17) (18, 0) (6, 3) (6, 15) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 6) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph.

<1, (3, 4, 12)>
<2, (11, 13, 19)>
<7, (0, 12, 13)>
<8, (5, 9, 16)>
