Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 17) (13, 3) (13, 9) (17, 15) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 11) (8, 9) (8, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 4) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 18) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
The first step is to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (3-star pattern). We will list these nodes with their neighboring nodes. 

1. (0, 5, 6) 
2. (2, 11, 14) 
3. (4, 5, 16) 
4. (7, 5, 9) 
5. (8, 9, 12)
6. (15, 17, 18)
7. (13, 3, 9)

Now, we will count the number of unique 3-stars.

[7]  
<0, (5, 6, 0)>  
<2, (11, 14, 2)>  
<4, (16, 5, 4)>  
<7, (5, 9, 7)>  
<8, (9, 12, 8)>  
<15, (17, 18, 15)>  
<13, (9, 3, 13)>
