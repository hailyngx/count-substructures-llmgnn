Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star where one node is the center and the other three nodes are the leaves connected to the center node.

Let's go step-by-step to find the 3-stars:

1. Start by identifying all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with three edges: 1, 3, 10, 13

2. For each of these potential centers, identify the unique 3-stars they are part of in the given graph:

<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<3, (11, 12, 8)>
<10, (9, 4, 12)>
<13, (6, 2, 14)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
