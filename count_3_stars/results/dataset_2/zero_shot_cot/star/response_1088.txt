Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1: (1, 6, 8, 11), (1, 2, 6, 13)
2. Node 2: (2, 1, 3, 14)
3. Node 3: (3, 2, 5, 13)
4. Node 4: (4, 6, 7, 14), (4, 7, 8, 2)
5. Node 5: (5, 3, 10, 13)
6. Node 6: (6, 1, 4, 7)
7. Node 7: (7, 4, 6, 13)
8. Node 8: (8, 1, 4, 7)
9. Node 9: (9, 10, 11, 0)
10. Node 10: (10, 5, 9, 13)
11. Node 11: (11, 1, 9, 12)
12. Node 12: (12, 11, 14, 0)
13. Node 13: (13, 2, 5, 7)
14. Node 14: (14, 0, 4, 12)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: <1, (6, 8, 11)>, <1, (2, 6, 13)>, <2, (1, 3, 14)>, <3, (2, 5, 13)>, <4, (6, 7, 14)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, <5, (3, 10, 13)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 13)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (10, 11, 0)>, <10, (5, 9, 13)>, <11, (1, 9, 12)>, <12, (11, 14, 0)>, <13, (2, 5, 7)>, <14, (0, 4, 12)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
