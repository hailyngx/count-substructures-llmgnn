Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 26) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 5) (18, 4) (18, 5) (22, 5) (22, 29) (12, 27) (12, 8) (12, 26) (7, 24) (7, 1) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 25) (17, 6) (17, 23) (29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 26) (11, 21) (28, 3) (28, 25) (5, 27) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 6) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 24) (1, 8) (15, 5) (15, 16) (8, 12) (8, 1) (19, 25) (19, 10) (2, 27) (2, 9) (2, 6) (3, 27) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 10) (14, 9) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 2) (24, 7) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 23) (20, 26) (26, 0) (26, 12) (26, 29) (26, 20) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 23) (9, 2) (9, 14) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 13) (25, 19) (16, 4) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 3) (10, 16) (23, 17) (23, 24) (23, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes and their connections to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 27, 21, and 26: <0, (27, 21, 26)>
2. Node 27 is connected to nodes 0, 12, and 2: <27, (0, 12, 2)>
3. Node 12 is connected to nodes 27, 8, and 26: <12, (27, 8, 26)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 10, and 16: <4, (18, 10, 16)>
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 27, 18, and 22: <5, (27, 18, 22)>
6. Node 29 is connected to nodes 22, 16, and 26: <29, (22, 16, 26)>
7. Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 16, and 24: <1, (7, 16, 24)>
8. Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 17, and 13: <6, (0, 17, 13)>
9. Node 3 is connected to nodes 27, 28, and 24: <3, (27, 28, 24)>
10. Node 15 is connected to nodes 5, 16, and 15: <15, (5, 16, 15)>
11. Node 8 is connected to nodes 12, 1, and 8: <8, (12, 1, 8)>
12. Node 19 is connected to nodes 25, 10, and 19: <19, (25, 10, 19)>
13. Node 2 is connected to nodes 27, 9, and 6: <2, (27, 9, 6)>
14. Node 23 is connected to nodes 17, 24, and 21: <23, (17, 24, 21)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars found:
