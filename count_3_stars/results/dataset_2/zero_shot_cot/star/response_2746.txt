Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes involved in the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Next, we need to find all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them:

<0, (5, 2, 1)>
<1, (5, 2, 7)>
<2, (4, 1, 0)>
<3, (8, 7, 4)>
<4, (9, 5, 2)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (8, 3, 4)>
<7, (8, 2, 1)>
<8, (9, 6, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 6)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
