Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph and count them:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 0)
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 4)

Considering the above, the 3-stars in this graph are:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<5, (9, 8, 5)>
<5, (8, 3, 0)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 3, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 3, 4)>

By counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
