Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to determine the 3-stars in the graph. 

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 8, and 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 4, 8, and 0.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 3, and 2.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, and 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 0.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 4, 2, and 8.

Now, we'll count the number of 3-stars. 

- 3-star with central node 5: <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 1)>
- 3-star with central node 6: <6, (1, 7, 4)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- 3-star with central node 1: <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>
- 3-star with central node 3: <3, (9, 1, 0)>, <3, (1, 0, 6)>
- 3-star with central node 4: <4, (6, 7, 0)>
- 3-star with central node 7: <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- 3-star with central node 2: <2, (5, 9, 1)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>
- 3-star with central node 8: <8, (5, 6, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
