Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which can be the center of a 3-star. Based on the given edges, the nodes that qualify are:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, and 1)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 14, and 10)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, and 3)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, and 10)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 5, 4, 11, and 0)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 9, 4, 2, 12, and 14)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 8, 13, 11, and 10)

Now, let's count how many 3-stars exist in the graph:
- For Node 5: (5, 9, 6), (5, 1, 8), (5, 4, 8), (5, 6, 9) - 4 3-stars
- For Node 9: (9, 5, 6), (9, 1, 10), (9, 10, 14), (9, 6, 5) - 4 3-stars
- For Node 6: (6, 5, 9), (6, 1, 5), (6, 3, 8), (6, 5, 9) - 3 3-stars
- For Node 4: (4, 5, 8), (4, 10, 2), (4, 8, 5) - 3 3-stars
- For Node 8: (8, 5, 4), (8, 0, 11), (8, 4, 5) - 3 3-stars
- For Node 10: (10, 9, 14), (10, 4, 2), (10, 2, 12), (10, 12, 14) - 4 3-stars
- For Node 0: (0, 8, 11), (0, 13, 12), (0, 11, 8) - 3 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (4, 8, 1)>, <9, (10, 1, 14)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (10, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 11, 3)>, <10, (12, 14, 2)>.
