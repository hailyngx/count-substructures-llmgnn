Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 28) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 27) (17, 11) (17, 4) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 23) (12, 10) (12, 2) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 0) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 21) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 3) (25, 7) (25, 21) (8, 9) (8, 20) (8, 6) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 27) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 28) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 24) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 4) (22, 19) (22, 27) (0, 1) (0, 4) (16, 24) (16, 21) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 21) (11, 15) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 11) (24, 4) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 29) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (18, 14) (18, 23) (18, 15) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 13) (20, 8) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 24) (27, 17) (27, 14) (27, 22) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 23) (29, 21) (29, 15) (15, 2) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 29) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (0, 4, 26)>
<2, (3, 5, 12)>
<4, (0, 17, 24)>
<6, (8, 10, 14)>
<7, (3, 23, 25)>
<9, (8, 13, 28)>
<11, (15, 21, 24)>
<15, (11, 18, 29)>
<16, (21, 24, 16)>
<19, (4, 10, 22)>
<20, (8, 6, 14)>
<26, (1, 21, 28)>
<27, (14, 17, 22)>

Total number of 3-stars: [13]
