Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 1) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 19) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 17) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (15, 16) (15, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify them first:

- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 10, 14, and 7.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 15, 17, and 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 16, 13, 10, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 0, and 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 4, 18, and 1.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 17.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 17, and 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 5, 6, and 19.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 2, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 12, and 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 6.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 3.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 16, 10, 17, and 15.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 12.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 14.

From these connections, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<11, (16, 10, 14)>
<16, (11, 15, 17)>
<4, (16, 13, 10)>
<7, (11, 0, 13)>
<10, (11, 4, 18)>
<0, (7, 13, 17)>
<13, (4, 8, 17)>
<14, (11, 5, 6)>
<1, (9, 10, 2)>
<6, (14, 12, 19)>
<12, (6, 1, 3)>
<18, (16, 10, 17)>
<3, (5, 4, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [13].
