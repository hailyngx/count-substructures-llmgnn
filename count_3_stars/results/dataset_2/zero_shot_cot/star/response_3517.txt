Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 14) (3, 14) (3, 12) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 5) (19, 13) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 16) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 5, 6
Node 1: 8, 6
Node 2: 8, 17
Node 3: 14, 12
Node 4: 15, 16, 6, 14
Node 5: 9, 19, 0
Node 6: 11, 16, 1, 4, 0
Node 7: 11
Node 8: 15, 2, 1, 14
Node 9: 5, 18, 14
Node 10: 13, 16 
Node 11: 7, 18, 13, 6
Node 12: 3, 17
Node 13: 15, 10, 11, 19
Node 14: 3, 8, 18, 4
Node 15: 8, 13, 4
Node 16: 10, 17, 6, 4
Node 17: 12, 2, 16
Node 18: 9, 11, 14
Node 19: 5, 13

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 16)>
<8, (1, 2, 14)>
<13, (10, 11, 19)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the output is: [4].
