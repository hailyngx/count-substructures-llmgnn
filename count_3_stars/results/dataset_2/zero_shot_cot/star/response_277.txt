Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (8, 1, 3)>
<8, (6, 4, 2)>
<2, (8, 0, -)>
<0, (8, 6, 7)>
<7, (9, 0, 1)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>

Since all 3-stars have been listed once each, the total count is [10].
