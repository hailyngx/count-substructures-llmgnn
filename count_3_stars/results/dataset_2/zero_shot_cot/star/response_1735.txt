Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 15) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 17) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 13) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 15) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 17) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (17, 19) (17, 7) (17, 4) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

From the given edges, we can find the 3-stars based on the definition of a 3-star graph, where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<4, (10, 16, 17)>
<6, (3, 7, 15)>
<7, (6, 13, 17)>
<8, (1, 9, 10)>
<9, (5, 8, 19)>
<10, (4, 8, 13)>
<13, (0, 7, 14)>
<15, (6, 9, 11)>
<16, (2, 4, 14)>
<17, (4, 7, 19)>
<19, (9 ,18, 17)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
