Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. The central node 4 forms a 3-star with the leaves 7, 13, and 0: <4, (7, 13, 0)>
2. The central node 7 forms a 3-star with the leaves 11, 3, and 6: <7, (11, 3, 6)>
3. The central node 1 forms a 3-star with the leaves 3, 14, and 5: <1, (3, 14, 5)>
4. The central node 10 forms a 3-star with the leaves 4, 11, and 12: <10, (4, 11, 12)>
5. The central node 12 forms a 3-star with the leaves 1, 10, and 11: <12, (1, 10, 11)>
6. The central node 14 forms a 3-star with the leaves 4, 1, and 5: <14, (4, 1, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
