Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

1. Node 5: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3)
2. Node 9: (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0)
3. Node 4: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3)
4. Node 7: (7, 9) (7, 6)
5. Node 8: (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1)
6. Node 0: (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6)
7. Node 2: (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1)
8. Node 1: (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6)
9. Node 6: (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3)
10. Node 3: (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (9, 6, -)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (9, 0, 1)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<6, (7, 0, 3)>

Therefore, there are total [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
