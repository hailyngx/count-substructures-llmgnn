Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 18) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<15, (7, 8, 2)>
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 17, 16)>
<10, (3, 17, 14)>
<11, (7, 13, 12)>
<13, (11, 4, 18)>
<17, (9, 10, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 13)>
<0, (5, 12, 1)>
<16, (9, 1, 19)>
<18, (13, 19, 7)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [10]
