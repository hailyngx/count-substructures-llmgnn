Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the edges provided. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars <center, [leaves]>:

<5, (9, 6, 12)>
<9, (5, 2, 11)>
<4, (8, 11, 6)>
<7, (5, 0, 3)>
<1, (2, 12, 8)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (5, 4, 14)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<0, (7, 3, 8)>
<10, (0, 12, 13)>
<11, (9, 4, 8)>
<14, (7, 6, 10)>
<12, (5, 9, 1)>
<13, (10, 11)>  

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars found in the list.
