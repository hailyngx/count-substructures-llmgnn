Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 29) (22, 27) (22, 0) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 11) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 0) (29, 13) (29, 23) (29, 18) (1, 16) (1, 28) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 27) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 18) (18, 4) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 19) (18, 23) (24, 6) (26, 6) (26, 11) (21, 3) (21, 8) (20, 17) (20, 5) (5, 20) (5, 19) (5, 23) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 0) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 0) (23, 29) (23, 18) (23, 5) (23, 28) (8, 7) (8, 21) (8, 11) (0, 22) (0, 2) (0, 19) (0, 25) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 1) (28, 1) (28, 23) (10, 14) (10, 4) (11, 15) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 8) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These could potentially be the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 13
- Node 3
- Node 15
- Node 6
- Node 9
- Node 4
- Node 7
- Node 16
- Node 5
- Node 28
- Node 10

Next, we will find the 3-stars with these nodes as the centers:
- 3-star with center at node 13: <13, (25, 12, 29)>
- 3-star with center at node 3: <3, (15, 21, 12)>
- 3-star with center at node 15: <15, (3, 6, 11)>
- 3-star with center at node 6: <6, (15, 9, 24)>
- 3-star with center at node 9: <9, (6, 2, 7)>
- 3-star with center at node 4: <4, (14, 7, 18)>
- 3-star with center at node 7: <7, (9, 4, 25)>
- 3-star with center at node 16: <16, (15, 2, 1)>
- 3-star with center at node 5: <5, (20, 19, 23)>
- 3-star with center at node 28: <28, (1, 23, 18)>
- 3-star with center at node 10: <10, (14, 4, 11)>

Therefore, there are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So the answer is [11].
