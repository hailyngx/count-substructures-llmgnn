Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 15) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 16) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 7) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 7) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 19) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (16, 6) (16, 18) (19, 12) (19, 0) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 11) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. 
From the given edges, the nodes involved in 3-star structures are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For each node, count the number of 3-star structures that can be formed with that node as the center.
- Finally, add up all the counts for each node.

[<1, (8, 6, 13)>, <3, (8, 5, 9)>, <5, (8, 3, 15)>, <6, (8, 1, 16)>, <7, (8, 14, 18)>, <8, (1, 5, 3)>, <9, (14, 3, 13)>, <10, (0, 15, 7)>, <11, (15, 8, 12)>, <12, (17, 11, 19)>, <14, (9, 7, 2)>, <15, (11, 10, 18)>, <16, (6, 18, 16)>, <17, (5, 12, 8)>, <18, (12, 16, 7)>, <19, (0, 12, 19)>]
