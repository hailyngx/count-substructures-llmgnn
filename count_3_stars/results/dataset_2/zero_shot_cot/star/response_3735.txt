Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors. These nodes could potentially be the center nodes of 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 
- Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3)
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 2)

Now, let's check for each potential center node the neighbors' connections. 

For Node 7:
- Node 9 is not connected to Node 1 or Node 0. So, <7, (9, 5, 8)> is a 3-star.
- Node 0 is not connected to Node 1 or Node 9. So, <7, (0, 4, 8)> is a 3-star.

For Node 1:
- Node 5 is connected to all potential leaves, but Node 5 already has 5 connections, so <1, (5, 4, 2)> is not a valid 3-star.

Therefore, the 3-star configurations in the given graph are: <7, (9, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>.

[The number of 3-stars in the graph is 2.]
