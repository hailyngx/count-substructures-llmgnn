Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 6) (18, 17) (18, 29) (22, 27) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 15) (28, 20) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 12) (15, 28) (16, 20) (11, 23) (11, 21) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 13) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 26) (3, 28) (3, 12) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 20) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 7) (25, 8) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 14) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 21) (21, 11) (21, 13) (21, 24) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 25) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 14) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 24) (24, 21) (24, 7) (24, 20) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 29) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 12) (20, 28) (20, 16) (20, 10) (20, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 19, 27)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 14, 23)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 3, 5, 25)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 3, 19, 29)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 4, 21, 23)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 1, 2, 25)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 7, 18, 27)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 10, 16, 24)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 11, 13, 24)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 7, 20, 21)
- Node 25 (neighbors: 8, 14, 29)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 1, 3, 28)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 3, 15, 26)
- Node 29 (neighbors: 12, 18, 25)

Based on the identified nodes, we can find the 3-stars in the graph:
- There are 2 instances of <0, (1, 19, 27)>
- There are 3 instances of <6, (1, 14, 23)>
- There are 2 instances of <8, (3, 5, 25)>
- There are 2 instances of <12, (3, 19, 29)>
- There are 3 instances of <13, (4, 21, 23)>
- There are 2 instances of <14, (1, 2, 25)>
- There are 2 instances of <17, (7, 18, 27)>
- There are 2 instances of <20, (10, 16, 24)>
- There are 3 instances of <21, (11, 13, 24)>
- There are 2 instances of <24, (7, 20, 21)>
- There are 2 instances of <25, (8, 14, 29)>
- There are 2 instances of <26, (1, 3, 28)>
- There are 2 instances of <28, (3, 15, 26)>
- There are 2 instances of <29, (12, 18, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
