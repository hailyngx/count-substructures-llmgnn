Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 19) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 16) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (19, 18) (19, 5) (7, 11) (7, 1) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 16) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 7) (0, 15) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 5) (12, 10) (12, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three neighbors.
2. For each such node, check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:  
- Node 5: (3, 5), (5, 13), (5, 14), (5, 19)  
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 13)  
- Node 9: (6, 9), (9, 8), (9, 4)  
- Node 13: (13, 6), (13, 10), (13, 5), (13, 11)  
- Node 15: (3, 15), (15, 0), (15, 18), (15, 14)  
- Node 16: (6, 16), (16, 4), (16, 8), (16, 1)  
- Node 17: (17, 12), (17, 18), (17, 11)  

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (5, 13, 14)>  
<15, (0, 18, 14)>  
<6, (9, 10, 13)>  
<16, (4, 8, 1)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
