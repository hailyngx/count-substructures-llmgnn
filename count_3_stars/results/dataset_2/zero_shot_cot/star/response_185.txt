Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all 3-stars. 

Given the definition of a 3-star, it consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify all possible 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges:

1. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 9, 0, and 7 are all connected to node 5. This forms a 3-star where node 5 is the central node with nodes 9, 0, and 7 as leaves. Thus, we have the 3-star: <5, (9, 0, 7)>.

2. Similarly, we can see that nodes 9, 1, and 7 are all connected to node 5, forming a 3-star: <5, (9, 1, 7)>.

3. Nodes 1, 3, and 4 are connected to each other, forming a 3-star as well: <1, (3, 4)>.

4. Also, nodes 4, 8, and 6 form a 3-star: <4, (8, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
<5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <1, (3, 4)>, <4, (8, 6)>
