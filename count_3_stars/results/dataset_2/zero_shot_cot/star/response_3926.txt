Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 18) (10, 16) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 2) (13, 19) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 9) (6, 18) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 15) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 15) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three adjacent nodes in each 3-star configuration.

Let's go through the edges and identify the 3-stars:
1. Looking at the edges, we can see that the central node should be 7 as it has connections to 0, 12 and 15. So one 3-star is <7, (0, 12, 15)>.

2. The next possible central node could be 11, with connections to 1, 14 and 0. So another 3-star is <11, (1, 14, 0)>.

3. Another 3-star can be formed around node 3 with connections to 1, 9, and 5. This gives us <3, (1, 9, 5)>.

4. Moving on, node 6 can form the next 3-star with connections to 3, 14, and 13. This gives us <6, (3, 14, 13)>.

5. Lastly, node 18 can be the central node with connections to 2, 6, and 15, giving us the 3-star <18, (2, 6, 15)>.

There are a total of five unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
