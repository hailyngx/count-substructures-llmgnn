Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 28) (1, 4) (1, 9) (21, 13) (2, 22) (2, 7) (29, 27) (29, 11) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 19) (27, 29) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 29) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 22) (5, 15) (6, 23) (6, 4) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 9) (22, 2) (22, 11) (25, 16) (25, 4) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 26) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 8) (14, 27) (14, 11) (14, 28) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 9) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 12) (13, 28) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 8) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 16) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 9) (8, 10) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 18) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 14) (28, 13) (16, 25) (16, 26) (16, 9) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 4) (18, 8) (18, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 25) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (27, 19, 24)>
<1, (28, 4, 9)>
<2, (22, 7, 11)>
<3, (27, 26, 12)>
<4, (1, 25, 6)>
<7, (2, 24, 8)>
<8, (10, 18, 26)>
<9, (1, 24, 15)>
<10, (11, 12, 8)>
<11, (10, 22, 14)>
<12, (10, 13, 3)>
<13, (21, 19, 28)>
<14, (27, 11, 28)>
<15, (5, 19, 9)>
<16, (25, 26, 9)>
<19, (0, 13, 9)>
<20, (23, 28, 6)>
<22, (2, 11, 27)>
<23, (6, 20, 26)>
<24, (0, 7, 9)>
<25, (16, 4, 26)>
<26, (23, 16, 15)>
<27, (29, 0, 14)>
<28, (13, 20, 1)>
<29, (27, 11, 13)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we have found a total of [23] 3-stars.
