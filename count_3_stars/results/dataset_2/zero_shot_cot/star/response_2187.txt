Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 14) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 1) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 8) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 0) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 17) (18, 9) (18, 0) (6, 3) (6, 23) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 6) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 16) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 11) (27, 6) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 20) (17, 8) (17, 13) (20, 8) (20, 27) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 27) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 1) (19, 9) (19, 22) (19, 13) (19, 24) (7, 29) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 21) (1, 25) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (16, 9) (16, 26) (16, 12) (24, 3) (24, 19) (24, 21) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 0) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 18) (0, 15) (10, 2) (10, 23) (10, 27) (21, 11) (21, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars:

- Node 3: (3, 25), (3, 28), (3, 24)
- Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 23), (6, 28)
- Node 8: (8, 23), (8, 28), (8, 20)
- Node 13: (13, 17), (13, 12), (13, 19)
- Node 14: (14, 29), (14, 26), (14, 27)
- Node 15: (15, 8), (15, 26), (15, 0)
- Node 16: (16, 9), (16, 26), (16, 12)
- Node 19: (19, 9), (19, 22), (19, 13)
- Node 21: (21, 11), (21, 24)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars formed by the center and the leaves:

<3, (25, 28, 24)>  
<6, (3, 23, 28)>  
<8, (23, 28, 20)>  
<13, (17, 12, 19)>  
<14, (29, 26, 27)>  
<15, (8, 26, 0)>  
<16, (9, 26, 12)>  
<19, (9, 22, 13)>  
<21, (11, 24, 21)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
