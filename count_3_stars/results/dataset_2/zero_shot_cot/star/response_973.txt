Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examination, the following 3-stars are present in the graph:
<0, (8, 12, 13)>
<1, (2, 6, 14)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 12)>
<4, (6, 7, 11)>
<5, (10, 13, 14)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 10)>
<9, (3, 8, 10)>
<10, (5, 9, 13)>
<11, (4, 7, 12)>
<12, (0, 3, 11)>
<13, (0, 5, 14)>
<14, (1, 5, 13)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
