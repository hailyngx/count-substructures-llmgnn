Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 5) (3, 17) (11, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 14) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 16) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 16) (18, 6) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, we can identify the 3-star patterns in the graph based on the definition provided. 

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 12, 16)>
<7, (4, 9, 16)>
<12, (4, 14, 0)>
<16, (4, 19, 2)>
<1, (17, 6, 5)>
<17, (1, 13, 3)>
<3, (17, 13, 5)>
<11, (19, 15, 0)>
<10, (15, 19, 9)>
<15, (10, 9, 13)>
<13, (17, 15, 14)>
<8, (19, 14, 6)>
<18, (6, 15, 0)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
