Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 7) (5, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (0, 11) (0, 9) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 9) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes involved in each 3-star based on the given edges:
1. From node 11: (11, 16), (11, 1), (11, 0), (11, 8)
2. From node 16: (16, 11), (16, 7), (16, 3)
3. From node 14: (14, 17), (14, 15)
4. From node 17: (17, 14), (17, 1), (17, 13), (17, 2)
5. From node 8: (8, 11), (8, 2)
6. From node 13: (13, 17), (13, 3), (13, 19), (13, 7)
7. From node 5: (5, 15)
8. From node 6: (6, 19), (6, 4)
9. From node 0: (0, 11), (0, 9)
10. From node 2: (2, 17), (2, 8), (2, 7)
11. From node 4: (4, 6), (4, 3)
12. From node 18: (18, 19), (18, 15)
13. From node 7: (7, 16), (7, 13), (7, 2), (7, 12), (7, 10)
14. From node 12: (12, 7), (12, 1), (12, 9)
15. From node 1: (1, 11), (1, 17), (1, 12), (1, 10)
16. From node 19: (19, 13), (19, 6), (19, 18), (19, 9)
17. From node 3: (3, 16), (3, 13), (3, 4), (3, 10)
18. From node 10: (10, 7), (10, 1), (10, 3)

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:
<11, (16, 1, 0)>
<17, (14, 13, 2)>
<13, (19, 7, 3)>
<7, (16, 13, 2)>
<1, (11, 17, 10)>

There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
