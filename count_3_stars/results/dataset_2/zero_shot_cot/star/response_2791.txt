Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 19) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 1) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 18) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (8, 0) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 13) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by counting the number of 3-stars connected to each node and summing them up. 

The nodes along with the number of 3-stars they are a part of are listed below:
<0, (1, 5, 8)> - 2
<1, (0, 5, 9)> - 3
<2, (9, 11, 15)> - 3
<4, (12, 14, 17)> - 3
<5, (1, 14, 16)> - 3
<6, (17, 18, 19)> - 3
<7, (13, 19)> - 2
<8, (0)> - 1
<9, (1, 2, 15)> - 3
<10, (11, 12)> - 2
<11, (2, 10, 13)> - 3
<12, (4, 13, 16, 19)> - 4
<13, (7, 11, 12, 18)> - 4
<14, (4, 5, 16)> - 3
<15, (2, 15, 17, 18)> - 4
<16, (5, 12, 14)> - 3
<17, (4, 6, 15)> - 3
<18, (0, 6, 13, 15)> - 4
<19, (6, 12, 13, 1)> - 4

Adding up the counts, we get a total of [55] 3-stars in the graph.
