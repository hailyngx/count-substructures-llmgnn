Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 6, 5, 2
- Node 1: 4, 2, 8
- Node 2: 9, 8, 1, 3, 0
- Node 3: 9, 5, 2
- Node 4: 7, 9, 5, 1, 6
- Node 5: 4, 6, 0, 3
- Node 6: 4, 9, 5, 0
- Node 7: 4, 9, 8
- Node 8: 7, 9, 2, 1
- Node 9: 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 3

Next, let's find all 3-stars in the given graph:
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (2, 7, 4)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we have a total of [2].
