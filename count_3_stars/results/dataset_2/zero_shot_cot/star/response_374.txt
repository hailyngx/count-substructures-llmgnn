Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (22, 23) (22, 9) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 8) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 3) (27, 26) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 23) (7, 26) (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 26) (10, 11) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 19) (20, 1) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 28) (12, 29) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 17) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 25) (0, 6) (2, 24) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 1) (25, 26) (25, 24) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 25) (1, 11) (1, 20) (1, 25) (5, 3) (8, 15) (8, 29) (8, 21) (28, 12) (28, 0) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 18) (14, 6) (14, 3) (3, 27) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (19, 23) (19, 21) (21, 27) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 29) (29, 12) (29, 8) (29, 21) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 16) (26, 25) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all sets of nodes that form a 3-star. 

1. Node 27 is the center with neighbors 15, 25, 21 forming a 3-star.  
   
2. Node 4 is the center with neighbors 13, 7, 9 forming a 3-star.  
   
3. Node 7 is the center with neighbors 4, 23, 12 forming a 3-star.  
   
4. Node 11 is the center with neighbors 16, 10, 1 forming a 3-star.  
   
5. Node 16 is the center with neighbors 11, 24, 26 forming a 3-star.  
   
6. Node 25 is the center with neighbors 27, 0, 1 forming a 3-star.

So, we have counted 6 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

<27, (15, 25, 21)>, <4, (13, 7, 9)>, <7, (4, 23, 12)>, <11, (16, 10, 1)>, <16, (11, 24, 26)>, <25, (27, 0, 1)>
