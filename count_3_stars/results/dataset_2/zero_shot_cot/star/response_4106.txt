Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (12, 14) (12, 19) (6, 13) (6, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 15) (9, 3) (9, 2) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 18) (10, 3) (10, 8) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 15) (5, 16) (5, 17) (19, 16) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph. 

1. <11, (16, 18, 8)>
2. <16, (11, 19, 5)>
3. <14, (17, 18, 12)>
4. <17, (14, 5, 15)>
5. <1, (3, 19, 0)>
6. <3, (1, 10, 9)>
7. <8, (11, 13, 2)>
8. <13, (8, 2, 18)>
9. <2, (8, 13, 9)>
10. <0, (1, 4, 19)>
11. <7, (17, 6)>
12. <12, (14, 19)>
13. <6, (13, 7)>
14. <4, (11, 0, 15)>
15. <9, (3, 2)>
16. <15, (17, 4, 18)>
17. <10, (3, 8)>

There are 17 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
