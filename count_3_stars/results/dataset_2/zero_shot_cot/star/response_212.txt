Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 12) (16, 7) (16, 15) (3, 1) (15, 16) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 1) (14, 2) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., the centers of the 3-stars). Then, we can count the number of such 3-stars.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 5 is connected to 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to 1, 5, and 16.
- Node 8 is connected to 2, 6, and 17.
- Node 17 is connected to 4, 5, and 18.
- Node 18 is connected to 1, 13, and 17.
- Node 19 is connected to 6, 10, and 18.

2. Count the number of 3-stars involving these nodes:
- For node 5: <5, (4, 7, 9)>
- For node 7: <7, (1, 5, 16)>
- For node 8: <8, (2, 6, 17)>
- For node 17: <17, (4, 5, 18)>
- For node 18: <18, (1, 13, 17)>
- For node 19: <19, (6, 10, 18)>

Count of 3-stars = 6

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
