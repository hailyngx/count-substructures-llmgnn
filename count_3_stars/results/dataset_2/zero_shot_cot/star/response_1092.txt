Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the nodes that meet this criteria:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 3.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 7.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 1.

To find the number of 3-stars, we need to count the unique combinations of center nodes and leaf nodes. Let's list them:

<5, (8, 1, 0)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
