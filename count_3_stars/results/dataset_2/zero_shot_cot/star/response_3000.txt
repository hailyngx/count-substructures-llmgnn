Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 15) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 17) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 6) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 13) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 17) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 12) (1, 0) (1, 16) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 3) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 17) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 9) (9, 17) (5, 10) (5, 7) 

Response:
There are <0, (1, 13, 14)>, <2, (3, 6, 13)>, <6, (12, 15, 16)>, <7, (5, 8, 17)>, and <10, (5, 18, 19)> 3-stars.
Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the graph.
