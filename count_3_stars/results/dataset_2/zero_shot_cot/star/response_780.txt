Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 5 since it's the central node of the 3-stars. 
Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, and 4. 

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars in the graph. 
- For node 5, the 3-stars are <5, (9, 6, 8)> and <5, (9, 6, 4)>.
- For node 1, there is no 3-star as it only has two edges. 
- For node 3, there is no 3-star as it only has three edges. 
- For node 4, the 3-star is <4, (5, 8, 2)>.
- For node 8, the 3-star is <8, (5, 9, 1)>.
- For node 6, the 3-star is <6, (5, 1, 7)>.
- For node 7, the 3-star is <7, (5, 9, 2)>.

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we have found 5 of them. 
Therefore, the answer is [5].
