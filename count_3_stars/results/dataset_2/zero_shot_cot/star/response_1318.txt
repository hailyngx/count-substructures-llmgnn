Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 10) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-star structures in the given graph. 

The 3-star structures are:
<0, (6, 10, 1)>
<1, (8, 11, 10)>
<2, (4, 7, 12)>
<3, (9, 6, 12)>
<4, (7, 8, 13)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
