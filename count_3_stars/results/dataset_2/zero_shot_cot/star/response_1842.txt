Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 5) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 11) (3, 2) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 19) (1, 10) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 19) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 0) (16, 14) (16, 12) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are central nodes of 3-star graphs.

Let's go through each node in the graph and check if it has exactly 3 neighbors. If it does, then it is the central node of a 3-star graph.

The nodes with 3 neighbors are as follows:
- Node 14
- Node 13
- Node 10
- Node 4
- Node 2
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 18
- Node 11
- Node 1
- Node 12
- Node 0

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<14, (17, 8, 19)>
<17, (14, 5, 19)>
<8, (14, 13, 9)>
<13, (8, 5, 15)>
<10, (6, 1, 4)>
<4, (10, 18, 11)>
<2, (18, 3, 7)>
<5, (17, 13, 6)>
<6, (10, 5, 11)>
<18, (2, 4, 12)>
<11, (2, 6, 4)>
<1, (10, 15)>
<12, (18, 16, 0)>
<0, (6, 9, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
