Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<6, (9, 7, 4)>
<9, (6, 7, 13)>
<4, (6, 8, 10)>
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<2, (8, 12, 5)>
<0, (6, 14, 7)>
<14, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (14, 11, 13)>
<11, (0, 3, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 0)>
<12, (2, 13, 10)>
<5, (4, 8, 2)>
<1, (7, 5, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
