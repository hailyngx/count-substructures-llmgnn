Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

Given the edges, we can analyze which nodes are connected to the central node. We will then count the 3-stars with the central node being each of the 15 nodes.

Now, let's list the 3-stars we find for each central node:
<0, (4, 11, 14)>
<1, (3, 5, 12)>
<2, (8, 12, 13)>
<3, (1, 4, 13)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 8, 14)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 10)>
<9, (7, 11, 12)>
<10, (7, 8, 12)>
<11, (0, 6, 9)>
<12, (1, 10, 14)>
<13, (3, 2, 14)>
<14, (0, 6, 12)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
