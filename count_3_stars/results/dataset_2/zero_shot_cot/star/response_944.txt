Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. <5, (9, 2, 8)>
2. <9, (5, 4, 7)>
3. <4, (9, 0, 6)>
4. <7, (9, 0, 3)>
5. <1, (6, 2, 8)>
6. <3, (7, 0, 8)>
7. <2, (5, 9, 4)>
8. <8, (5, 1, 3)>
9. <0, (4, 7, 3)>
10. <6, (4, 1, 3)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [10].
