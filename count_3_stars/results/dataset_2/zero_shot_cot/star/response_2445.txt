Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 10) (26, 16) (26, 27) (5, 19) (5, 16) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 2) (17, 4) (18, 22) (18, 29) (18, 3) (22, 9) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 8) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 21) (29, 18) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 3) (12, 27) (12, 25) (12, 23) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 24) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 28) (20, 11) (15, 20) (15, 4) (7, 14) (7, 0) (19, 5) (11, 20) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 12) (16, 26) (16, 5) (16, 6) (21, 2) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 15) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 10) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 20) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (3, 18) (3, 29) (6, 29) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 25) (24, 27) (24, 1) (24, 25) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (25, 12) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a central node will have exactly 3 edges connected to it, we need to find nodes with 3 incident edges.

Nodes with three incident edges:
- Node 9
- Node 22
- Node 27
- Node 20

Next, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<9, (22, 28, 10)>
<22, (9, 18, 27)>
<27, (26, 22, 12)>
<20, (0, 15, 8)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars as listed above, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
