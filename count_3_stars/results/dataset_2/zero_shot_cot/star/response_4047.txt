Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 since it has degree 4:
- 5: 0, 2, 3, 7

Now, let's identify 3-stars with node 5 as the center:
<5, (0, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 9 since it has degree 4:
- 9: 4, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's identify 3-stars with node 9 as the center:
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

So, in total, there are [6] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
