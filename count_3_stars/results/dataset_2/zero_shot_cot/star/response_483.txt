Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
Before identifying the 3-stars, let's analyze the graph. We have a total of 15 nodes and 60 edges. Each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

To identify each 3-star, we will look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them and list them as the center, with the nodes those edges connect to them as the leaves.

The number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 14)>
<4, (7, 9, 13)>
<7, (6, 10, 11)>
<10, (7, 13, 14)>
