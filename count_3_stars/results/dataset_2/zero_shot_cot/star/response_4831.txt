Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 6.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (7, 9, 8)>
<9, (4, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 3, 6)>
