Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 5) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 12) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (12, 15) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 8) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 3) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes where one node is connected to the other two nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars we find in the graph:
<6, (9, 5, 17)>
<6, (9, 10, 19)>
<9, (6, 4, 17)>
<9, (6, 18, 17)>
<10, (6, 2, 8)>
<11, (7, 5, 13)>
<2, (10, 15, 19)>
<2, (10, 1, 2)>
<18, (9, 1, 18)>
<5, (6, 7, 11)>
<4, (9, 13, 4)>
<1, (18, 13, 15)>
<15, (2, 14, 15)>
<15, (2, 12, 15)>
<0, (16, 0, 13)>
<16, (0, 8, 16)>
<14, (15, 19, 14)>
<12, (15, 12, 14)>
<7, (11, 8, 7)>
<8, (10, 16, 8)>
<13, (4, 16, 13)>
<13, (4, 1, 13)>
<3, (17, 8, 3)>
<3, (17, 19, 3)>

There are [24] 3-stars in the graph.
