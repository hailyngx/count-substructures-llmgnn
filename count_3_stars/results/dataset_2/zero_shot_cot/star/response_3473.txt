Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 12) (15, 11) (27, 22) (27, 14) (27, 20) (27, 19) (11, 15) (11, 21) (11, 17) (22, 27) (22, 23) (22, 5) (22, 25) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 1) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 28) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 24) (0, 23) (0, 16) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 24) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 26) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 17) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 7) (9, 25) (29, 19) (29, 13) (24, 6) (24, 14) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 12) (12, 15) (12, 23) (12, 26) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 26) (7, 19) (7, 13) (7, 17) (17, 11) (17, 28) (17, 7) (25, 22) (25, 9) (25, 13) (25, 4) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 4) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 4) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 25) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 4) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 21) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

1. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 20, and 21.
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 20, and 21.
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 19, and 28.
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 17, and 19.
5. Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 13, and 22.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
<2, (18, 20, 21)> 
<4, (1, 20, 21)>
<5, (6, 19, 28)>
<7, (13, 17, 19)>
<25, (4, 13, 22)>
