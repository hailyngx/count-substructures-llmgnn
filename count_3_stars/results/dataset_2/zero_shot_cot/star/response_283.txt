Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars present in the given graph. 

<4, (9, 1, 10)>
<6, (5, 7, 14)>
<7, (3, 13, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 14)>
