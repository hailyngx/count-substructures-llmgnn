Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (15, 16) (15, 0) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 15) (0, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 9) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 9) (9, 16) (9, 19) (9, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the connected 3-node subgraphs where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the provided edges, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <3, (2, 4, 6)>
2. <5, (0, 12, 13)>
3. <7, (1, 8, 12)>
4. <9, (10, 16, 19)>
5. <11, (3, 14, 19)>

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
