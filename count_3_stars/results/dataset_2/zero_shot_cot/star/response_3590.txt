Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 8) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 0) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 17) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 18) (17, 15) (19, 2) (19, 3) (16, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 13) (12, 2) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 18) (3, 19) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 18) 

Response:
There are 7 3-stars in the given graph. 

[7]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (2, 13, 17)>
<9, (8, 5, 13)>
<4, (3, 15, 17)>
<7, (1, 11, 16)>
<8, (0, 9, 18)>
<6, (0, 15, 18)>
<18, (0, 3, 17)>
