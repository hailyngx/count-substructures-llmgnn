Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 14) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 12) (19, 5) (16, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 14) (17, 3) (17, 7) (17, 0) (15, 13) (15, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-star configurations.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1: Connected to 4, 6, and 19
- Node 3: Connected to 5, 6, and 13
- Node 13: Connected to 2, 8, and 15
- Node 10: Connected to 0, 8, and 11
- Node 18: Connected to 2, 9, and 14
- Node 17: Connected to 0, 3, and 7
- Node 5: Connected to 3, 12, and 19
- Node 6: Connected to 1, 3, and 7
- Node 4: Connected to 1, 6, and 15
- Node 9: Connected to 2, 10, and 14
- Node 19: Connected to 1, 5, and 12
- Node 0: Connected to 10, 11, and 17
- Node 2: Connected to 9, 13, and 18
- Node 7: Connected to 6, 17, and 19
- Node 15: Connected to 4, 13, and 8
- Node 14: Connected to 9, 18, and 6
- Node 11: Connected to 0, 10, and 6
- Node 12: Connected to 5, 19, and 2
- Node 16: Connected to only 1

Next, let's write down the unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 6, 19)>
<3, (5, 6, 13)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<10, (0, 8, 11)>
<13, (2, 8, 15)>
<18, (2, 9, 14)>
<19, (1, 5, 12)>

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-star configurations in the given graph.
