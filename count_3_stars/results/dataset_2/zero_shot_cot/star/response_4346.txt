Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 21) (15, 9) (15, 24) (21, 15) (21, 8) (21, 18) (21, 14) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 18) (8, 27) (13, 17) (13, 14) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 19) (20, 7) (20, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 25) (18, 21) (18, 8) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 3) (26, 18) (26, 14) (9, 15) (9, 29) (9, 27) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 24) (29, 11) (14, 21) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 25) (7, 20) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 10) (0, 18) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 11) (25, 17) (25, 14) (25, 28) (25, 24) (4, 16) (22, 11) (11, 20) (11, 29) (11, 5) (11, 22) (3, 23) (3, 18) (3, 0) (6, 29) (2, 16) (2, 28) (19, 23) (19, 0) (19, 10) (24, 15) (24, 29) (24, 25) (24, 27) (27, 8) (27, 9) (27, 24) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 28) (28, 25) (28, 2) (28, 12) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify the nodes for each 3-star:
- (15, 21, 9)
- (21, 8, 18)
- (8, 23, 27)
- (13, 17, 14)
- (23, 3, 19)
- (20, 7, 11)
- (1, 5, 12)
- (26, 0, 18)
- (9, 29, 27)
- (14, 25, 21)
- (7, 16, 20)
- (0, 10, 18)
- (16, 5, 11)
- (25, 24, 17)
- (4, 2, 16)
- (22, 11, 20)
- (6, 29, 24)
- (19, 3, 0)
- (28, 2, 12)

2. Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <15, (21, 9, 24)>
- <21, (15, 8, 14)>
- <8, (21, 18, 23)>
- <9, (15, 29, 27)>
- <13, (17, 14, 25)>
- <23, (8, 3, 19)>
- <20, (7, 11, 16)>
- <1, (5, 12, 15)>
- <26, (18, 14, 0)>
- <7, (20, 16, 16)>
- <0, (18, 10, 3)>
- <25, (17, 14, 24)>
- <4, (16, 2, 16)>
- <22, (11, 20, 22)>
- <6, (29, 24, 27)>
- <19, (3, 0, 10)>
- <28, (2, 12, 25)>

3. Finally, count the number of 3-stars found:
- There are 17 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
