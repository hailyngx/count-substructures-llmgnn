Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
From the given edges:
- Node 5 is connected to 9, 2, 1, 3, and 7 (5 neighbors)
- Node 9 is connected to 5, 6, 8, 7, and 0 (5 neighbors)
- Node 4 is connected to 7, 8, 3, and 1 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7 is connected to 5, 9, 4, 2, and 1 (5 neighbors)
- Node 6 is connected to 9, 3, 8, and 0 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8 is connected to 9, 4, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2 is connected to 5, 7, 3, and 0 (4 neighbors)
- Node 0 is connected to 9, 6, and 2 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3 is connected to 5, 4, 6, and 2 (4 neighbors)
- Node 1 is connected to 5, 4, and 7 (3 neighbors)

Based on this information, nodes 8, 0, and 1 are the centers of the 3-stars.
Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<0, (9, 6, 2)>
<1, (5, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
