Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 8) (16, 19) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 13) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 8) (27, 5) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 9) (23, 22) (23, 28) (23, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 24) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 16) (8, 27) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 28) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 19) (14, 0) (14, 27) (17, 26) (17, 2) (29, 7) (29, 28) (29, 5) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 18) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 3) (28, 23) (28, 8) (28, 29) (6, 11) (6, 21) (21, 4) (21, 6) (21, 3) (21, 25) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 26) (18, 13) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 19) (25, 21) (19, 16) (19, 12) (19, 3) (15, 20) (2, 17) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 29) (1, 10) (20, 15) (20, 24) (24, 10) (24, 9) (24, 20) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that are the center of a 3-star. These nodes will have exactly three neighbors.
2. Verify if each neighbor of the center node is connected to the other neighbors forming a 3-star.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

There are 2 potential center nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: node 11 and node 10.
- Node 11's neighbors: 10, 13, 6
- Node 10's neighbors: 11, 8, 1

After checking, there are no 3-stars with center nodes 11 and 10.

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [0].

Therefore, the unique 3-star found is: <>
