Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 9) (16, 6) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 0) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 15) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (17, 16) (17, 13) (18, 8) (19, 7) (19, 3) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (14, 8) (14, 15) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 12: <11, (9, 5, 12)>
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 17, 4, and 9: <16, (17, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 6: <4, (7, 8, 6)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 19, and 1: <7, (0, 19, 1)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 2: <1, (3, 7, 2)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 19, 5, and 12: <3, (19, 5, 12)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 18: <8, (13, 14, 18)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 17, and 0: <13, (5, 17, 0)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 3, and 13: <5, (11, 3, 13)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 16, 4, and 5: <6, (16, 4, 5)>
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 15: <0, (7, 13, 15)>
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 0, 10, and 14: <15, (0, 10, 14)>

Therefore, there are 12 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [12].
