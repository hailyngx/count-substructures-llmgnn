Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 17) (27, 13) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 1) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 3) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 28) (7, 23) (7, 8) (12, 21) (12, 11) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 21) (9, 0) (9, 19) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 10) (22, 20) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 23) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 27) (13, 25) (13, 4) (17, 27) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 21) (3, 29) (3, 28) (0, 29) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 6) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 25) (16, 20) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 24) (6, 14) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 14) (24, 25) (11, 12) (11, 22) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 10) (4, 13) (4, 23) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 24) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 19) (19, 9) (19, 23) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 24) (21, 12) (21, 9) (21, 17) (21, 18) (18, 0) (18, 21) (20, 22) (20, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 27, 1, and 23: <15, (27, 1, 23)>
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 15, 17, and 13: <27, (15, 17, 13)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 29, 5, and 1: <2, (29, 5, 1)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 15, 2, and 26: <1, (15, 2, 26)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 22, 8, and 21: <9, (22, 8, 21)>
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 10: <22, (9, 11, 10)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 0, and 24: <6, (17, 0, 24)>
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 12, 9, and 17: <21, (12, 9, 17)>
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 13, 10, and 24: <25, (13, 10, 24)>
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 8, 6, and 24: <14, (8, 6, 24)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 22, 5, and 25: <10, (22, 5, 25)>
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 0, 21, and 20: <18, (0, 21, 20)>
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 22, 16, and 18: <20, (22, 16, 18)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the answer is [13].
