Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star configuration. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Starting with node 0:
    - No 3-star configuration exists with node 0 as the central node.

2. Moving to node 1:
    - <1, (5, 7, 3)> is a 3-star.
    - <1, (5, 7, 6)> is a 3-star.

3. Looking at node 2:
    - No 3-star configuration exists with node 2 as the central node.

4. Analyzing node 3:
    - <3, (9, 4, 0)> is a 3-star.
    - <3, (9, 1, 6)> is a 3-star.

5. Focusing on node 4:
    - <4, (9, 8, 3)> is a 3-star.

6. Examining node 5:
    - <5, (9, 8, 1)> is a 3-star.
    - <5, (9, 1, 7)> is a 3-star.

7. Checking node 6:
    - <6, (5, 1, 8)> is a 3-star.

8. Moving on to node 7:
    - <7, (5, 1, 8)> is a 3-star.

9. Looking at node 8:
    - <8, (9, 4, 3)> is a 3-star.

10. Focusing on node 9:
    - <9, (5, 4, 8)> is a 3-star.
    - <9, (5, 4, 3)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 7, 3)>, <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <3, (9, 4, 0)>, <3, (9, 1, 6)>, <4, (9, 8, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <8, (9, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 8)>.
