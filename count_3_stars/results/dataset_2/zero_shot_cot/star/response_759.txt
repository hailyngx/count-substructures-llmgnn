Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, which are the potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
Nodes with degree 3 are 5, 9, 4, 8, 2, and 0.

Next, let's look at the neighbors of each potential central node and check if they form 3-stars.
- For node 5: (5, 6, 7), (5, 2, 1)
- For node 9: (9, 6, 7), (9, 8, 3), (9, 0, 7)
- For node 4: (4, 8, 0), (4, 1, 3), (4, 3, 2)
- For node 8: (8, 9, 2), (8, 4, 2)
- For node 2: (2, 5, 4), (2, 4, 3), (2, 0, 8)
- For node 0: (0, 9, 7), (0, 4, 2), (0, 7, 5)

Therefore, we have identified the following unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 7, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <4, (8, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 4, 3)>, <0, (9, 4, 2)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
