Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 12) (15, 28) (27, 2) (27, 3) (7, 21) (7, 14) (7, 26) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 9) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 0) (10, 17) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 11) (1, 26) (1, 22) (26, 7) (26, 17) (26, 1) (26, 16) (26, 0) (28, 15) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 12) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 18) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 22) (6, 12) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 22) (13, 25) (13, 5) (13, 24) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 18) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (9, 21) (18, 29) (18, 24) (18, 11) (2, 27) (2, 19) (2, 0) (23, 10) (23, 19) (8, 7) (8, 20) (12, 15) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 14) (4, 16) (19, 29) (19, 2) (19, 23) (0, 25) (0, 17) (0, 26) (0, 2) (3, 27) (3, 20) (22, 15) (22, 1) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as these nodes could be potential central nodes of 3-stars. Nodes 7, 20, 17, 26, 28, 29, 5, 13, 24, 22, and 2 have degree 3.

Now, let's find the 3-stars. We observe the following unique 3-stars:
<7, (21, 14, 8)>
<20, (25, 3, 11)>
<17, (10, 0, 26)>
<26, (7, 17, 1)>
<28, (15, 6, 5)>
<29, (28, 19, 22)>
<5, (28, 13, 22)>
<13, (25, 5, 24)>
<24, (6, 13, 18)>
<22, (15, 1, 29)>
<2, (27, 19, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the graph.
