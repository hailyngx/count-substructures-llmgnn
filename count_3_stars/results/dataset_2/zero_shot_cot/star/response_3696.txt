Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 20) (0, 24) (27, 13) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 25) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 5) (7, 16) (7, 24) (7, 23) (21, 24) (5, 22) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 1) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 29) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 6) (28, 5) (28, 29) (29, 11) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 4) (14, 2) (14, 25) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 20) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 24) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 19) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (17, 18) (17, 25) (17, 8) (25, 18) (25, 14) (25, 17) (25, 8) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 25) (26, 3) (26, 11) (26, 20) (26, 29) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 13) (19, 12) (19, 16) (19, 2) (19, 13) (23, 15) (23, 7) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (24, 1) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 2) (13, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (20, 24, 1)>
<1, (9, 10, 24)>
<2, (14, 19, 13)>
<3, (15, 20, 26)>
<4, (5, 29, 12)>
<5, (22, 9, 28)>
<6, (15, 9, 20)>
<7, (16, 23, 24)>
<8, (18, 17, 25)>
<11, (22, 26, 29)>
<12, (4, 19, 27)>
<13, (2, 19, 27)>
<16, (7, 9, 19)>
<17, (18, 25, 8)>
<18, (22, 17, 25)>
<19, (12, 16, 2)>
<20, (3, 15, 26)>
<22, (18, 5, 11)>
<23, (7, 15, 24)>
<24, (0, 7, 21)>
<25, (18, 17, 14)>
<26, (3, 20, 29)>
<27, (13, 12, 2)>
<28, (5, 9, 29)>
<29, (11, 26, 4)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
