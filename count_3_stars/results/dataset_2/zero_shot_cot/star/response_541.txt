Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 13) (10, 1) (10, 2) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (15, 8) (15, 11) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 19) (3, 13) (3, 12) (7, 6) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 2) (5, 14) (5, 16) (5, 4) (2, 10) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Let's go through the edges and identify the 3-stars:

1. Start with each node, check if it has exactly three edges connected to it.
2. If a node satisfies the condition, list the 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (14, 16, 11)>
<1, (10, 13, 6)>
<2, (10, 16, 6)>
<3, (13, 12, 19)>
<4, (9, 6, 5)>
<5, (14, 16, 4)>
<6, (1, 10, 4)>
<8, (15, 9, 8)>
<9, (13, 4, 8)>
<11, (14, 0, 15)>
<12, (4, 18, 3)>
<13, (17, 1, 9)>
<15, (14, 0, 11)>
<16, (0, 5, 2)>
<17, (13, 3, 19)>
<18, (16, 12, 2)>
<19, (11, 12, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: [17]
