Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 3) (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 24) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 7) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 25) (1, 26) (1, 4) (1, 18) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 16) (20, 8) (20, 14) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 24) (29, 19) (29, 3) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 2) (10, 13) (21, 11) (3, 22) (3, 29) (3, 4) (28, 19) (28, 2) (0, 22) (0, 12) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 21) (11, 14) (14, 20) (14, 11) (9, 18) (9, 19) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 6) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 25) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 2) (6, 17) (6, 18) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 28) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 26) (16, 19) (25, 23) (25, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by checking each node to see if it can be the central node of a 3-star graph. 

Let's start checking each node.
- Node 0: (0, 12, 22) and (0, 2, 22)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 18) and (1, 18, 26)
- Node 2: (2, 5, 25) and (2, 24, 28)
- Node 3: (3, 4, 29) and (3, 22, 29)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 19) and (4, 3, 19)
- Node 5: (5, 2, 15) and (5, 2, 12)
- Node 6: (6, 17, 18)
- Node 7: (7, 8, 12) and (7, 13, 15)
- Node 8: (8, 7, 23) and (8, 20, 14)
- Node 9: (9, 18, 19)
- Node 10: (10, 13, 22)
- Node 11: (11, 15, 21) and (11, 12, 14)
- Node 12: (12, 0, 7) and (12, 5, 11)
- Node 13: (13, 7, 22) and (13, 18, 10)
- Node 14: (14, 20, 11)
- Node 15: (15, 7, 27) and (15, 11, 5)
- Node 16: (16, 19, 26)
- Node 17: (17, 6, 24)
- Node 18: (18, 1, 13) and (18, 6, 9)
- Node 19: (19, 4, 28) and (19, 9, 29)
- Node 20: (20, 8, 14)
- Node 21: (21, 11, 15)
- Node 22: (22, 0, 13) and (22, 3, 29)
- Node 23: (23, 25, 26) and (23, 13, 8)
- Node 24: (24, 2, 17) and (24, 17, 27)
- Node 25: (25, 2, 23)
- Node 26: (26, 1, 16) and (26, 16, 24)
- Node 27: (27, 15, 24)
- Node 28: (28, 2, 19)
- Node 29: (29, 3, 19)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [48]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
