Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 11, 5, 12, 13
- Node 1: 9, 3, 13, 4, 7
- Node 2: 9, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 6, 1, 2, 5, 12
- Node 4: 1, 7, 2
- Node 5: 3, 10, 0
- Node 6: 9, 14, 3, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 12, 11, 14
- Node 8: 6, 9, 2, 14
- Node 9: 6, 8, 2, 14, 1
- Node 10: 11, 5
- Node 11: 10, 7, 0
- Node 12: 3, 7, 14, 0
- Node 13: 1, 0, 14

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (11, 5, 12)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 2)>
<5, (3, 10, 0)>
<6, (9, 8, 14)>
<7, (1, 4, 12)>
<8, (6, 9, 2)>
<9, (1, 3, 13)>
<10, (11, 5, 0)>
<11, (7, 10, 0)>
<12, (3, 7, 14)>
<13, (1, 0, 14)>

Since each 3-star is listed only once, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
