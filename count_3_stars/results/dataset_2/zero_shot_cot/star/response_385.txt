Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all possible 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (1, 0, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (9, 7, 2)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
