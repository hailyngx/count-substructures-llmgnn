Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 12) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 5) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 1) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. We will follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify all nodes with degree 3, as these nodes could be potential centers of 3-stars.
Step 2: For each node with degree 3 as the potential center, list all unique 3-stars it forms.
Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Given the graph, the nodes with degree 3 are: 14, 17, 2, 4, 18, 8, 0, 7, 13, 15, 9, and 12.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars for each node with degree 3:

<14, (17, 0, 11)>
<17, (14, 13, 19)>
<2, (9, 3, 11)>
<4, (18, 15, 9)>
<18, (4, 7, 12)>
<8, (11, 12, 7)>
<0, (14, 7, 16)>
<7, (18, 8, 10)>
<13, (14, 17, 1)>
<15, (14, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 19)>
<12, (18, 8, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
