Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. 

Nodes 4, 5, 6, 1, 3, and 9 are potential central nodes since they have degree 4 (connected to 4 other nodes).

Now we will check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars:

- For node 4: <4, (9, 5, 1)> 
- For node 5: <5, (4, 7, 6)> and <5, (7, 6, 2)>
- For node 6: <6, (7, 5, 2)>
- For node 1: <1, (4, 7, 0)>
- For node 3: <3, (4, 9, 5)>

This gives us a total of 6 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
