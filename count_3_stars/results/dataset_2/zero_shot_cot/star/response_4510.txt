Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 2) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (9, 7) (9, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we will count the number of unique 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
- <4, (12, 10, 14)>
- <7, (3, 6, 14)>
- <1, (6, 5, 12)>
- <3, (7, 2, 11)>
- <5, (1, 8, 10)>
- <6, (7, 1, 10)>
- <2, (4, 3, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 14)>
- <0, (2, 10, 11)>
- <11, (3, 0, 9)>
- <9, (7, 11, 13)>
- <12, (4, 1, 11)>
- <10, (4, 5, 6)>
- <14, (4, 7, 5)>
- <13, (7, 6, 12)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [15].
