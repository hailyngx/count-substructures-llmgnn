Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it. These nodes can act as the central node of a 3-star.

Looking at the given edges, there are a total of 8 nodes with exactly three adjacent edges: 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, and 3.

To count the number of 3-stars, we can analyze each of these nodes:
1. Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 12)>
2. Node 7: <7, (1, 3, 9)>
3. Node 10: <10, (1, 6, 11)>
4. Node 11: <11, (6, 8, 10)>
5. Node 12: <12, (0, 2, 5)>
6. Node 1: <1, (0, 4, 10)>
7. Node 2: <2, (4, 12, 13)>
8. Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
