Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 26) (2, 18) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 5) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 23) (11, 24) (11, 0) (4, 7) (4, 24) (7, 29) (7, 4) (7, 23) (18, 2) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 24) (22, 6) (22, 8) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 26) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 15) (24, 0) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 3) (23, 10) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 20) (9, 25) (9, 12) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 21) (0, 11) (0, 24) (0, 28) (0, 19) (28, 14) (28, 5) (28, 0) (28, 1) (16, 13) (27, 14) (27, 29) (27, 10) (27, 21) (27, 3) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 12) (13, 16) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 19) (1, 28) (1, 13) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 13) (20, 23) (20, 13) (8, 15) (8, 22) (8, 26) (3, 5) (3, 23) (3, 27) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 21) (26, 17) (26, 6) (26, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph where the center is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We will now list the unique 3-stars found: 
<14, (17, 27, 28)>
<17, (14, 12, 26)>
<2, (18, -,-)>  (The node 2 is missing two edges to form a complete 3-star)
<10, (15, 27, 19)>
<11, (24, 0, -)>  (The node 11 is missing one edge to form a complete 3-star)
<4, (7, 24, -)>  (The node 4 is missing one edge to form a complete 3-star)
<7, (29, 4, 23)>
<18, (2, -,-)>  (The node 18 is missing two edges to form a complete 3-star)
<15, (10, 8, 24)>
<22, (6, 8, -)>  (The node 22 is missing one edge to form a complete 3-star)
<6, (22, 12, 19)>
<24, (11, 4, 15)>
<5, (29, 28, 3)>
<23, (10, 7, 3)>
<9, (25, 12, -)>  (The node 9 is missing one edge to form a complete 3-star)
<25, (9, 19, 21)>
<0, (11, 24, -)>  (The node 0 is missing one edge to form a complete 3-star)
<16, (13, -,-)>  (The node 16 is missing two edges to form a complete 3-star)
<21, (25, 27, 12)>
<13, (16, 20, 1)>
<1, (13, 28, -)>  (The node 1 is missing one edge to form a complete 3-star)
<20, (23, 13, -)>  (The node 20 is missing one edge to form a complete 3-star)
<8, (15, 22, 26)>
<3, (5, 23, 27)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
