Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 12) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 12) (21, 14) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 28) (25, 23) (25, 10) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 11) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 10) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 18) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 26) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 4) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 16) (13, 21) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 6) (22, 2) (22, 16) (0, 9) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 23) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 19) (24, 7) (24, 6) (24, 1) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 1) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 27) (19, 6) (19, 29) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 19) (1, 24) (1, 14) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 22) (16, 4) (27, 7) (27, 9) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 26) (4, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes in the graph:
Nodes: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29)

2. Identify the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: Neighbors: 9
- Node 1: Neighbors: 14, 24
- Node 2: Neighbors: 5, 9, 18, 22
- Node 3: Neighbors: 4, 15, 28
- Node 4: Neighbors: 3, 16, 26
- Node 5: Neighbors: 2, 13, 16, 18
- Node 6: Neighbors: 17, 19, 24
- Node 7: Neighbors: 12, 21, 24, 27
- Node 8: Neighbors: 10, 11, 29
- Node 9: Neighbors: 0, 2, 13, 27
- Node 10: Neighbors: 8, 23, 25, 29
- Node 11: Neighbors: 8
- Node 12: Neighbors: 7, 15, 18, 21
- Node 13: Neighbors: 5, 9, 17
- Node 14: Neighbors: 1, 15, 21
- Node 15: Neighbors: 3, 12, 14
- Node 16: Neighbors: 4, 5, 18, 22
- Node 17: Neighbors: 6, 13, 20
- Node 18: Neighbors: 2, 5, 12, 16
- Node 19: Neighbors: 6, 29
- Node 20: Neighbors: 17, 26, 28
- Node 21: Neighbors: 7, 12, 13, 14
- Node 22: Neighbors: 2, 16
- Node 23: Neighbors: 10, 25, 29
- Node 24: Neighbors: 1, 6, 7
- Node 25: Neighbors: 10, 23
- Node 26: Neighbors: 4, 20, 28
- Node 27: Neighbors: 7, 9
- Node 28: Neighbors: 3, 20, 26
- Node 29: Neighbors: 8, 10, 19, 23

3. Identify 3-star patterns:
- <3, (4, 15, 28)>
- <7, (12, 21, 24)>
- <12, (7, 15, 18)>
- <15, (3, 12, 14)>
- <18, (2, 5, 16)>

4. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [5]

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
