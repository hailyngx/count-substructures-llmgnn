Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 3) (22, 14) (22, 3) (22, 21) (10, 19) (10, 23) (11, 27) (11, 4) (2, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 28) (4, 5) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 27) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 25) (26, 13) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 17) (1, 24) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 9) (28, 4) (28, 8) (7, 16) (7, 29) (25, 14) (25, 9) (25, 29) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 3) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 21) (21, 22) (21, 16) (21, 24) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 27) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 27) (9, 17) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 20) (15, 18) (27, 11) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 23) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 20) (20, 8) (20, 9) (20, 3) (12, 0) (12, 26) (12, 24) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 21) (24, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (11, 28, 5)>
<8, (18, 27, 20)>
<13, (26, 1, 3)>
<14, (22, 0, 19)>
<16, (0, 7, 21)>
<19, (10, 5, 9)>
<21, (22, 16, 24)>
<24, (1, 5, 12)>
<27, (11, 8, 29)>
<28, (4, 8, 19)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
