Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 13) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 18) (12, 14) (18, 4) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 0) (13, 15) (13, 17) (0, 11) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 0) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (14, 2) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

Looking at the edges, the nodes that meet this criteria are: 9, 18, 17, and 15.

Next, we need to identify the leaves of each 3-star by finding the nodes they are connected to. 

- For node 9: (9, 15), (9, 18), (9, 8), (9, 0)
- For node 18: (18, 4), (18, 1), (18, 9), (18, 10), (18, 17)
- For node 17: (17, 18), (17, 13), (17, 6), (17, 0)
- For node 15: (15, 3), (15, 9), (15, 6), (15, 13)

For node 9, the 3-star is <9, (15, 18, 8)>
For node 18, the 3-star is <18, (4, 1, 9)>
For node 17, the 3-star is <17, (18, 13, 6)>
For node 15, the 3-star is <15, (3, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
