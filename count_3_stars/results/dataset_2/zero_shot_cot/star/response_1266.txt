Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 28) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 19) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 2) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 24) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 18) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 14) (28, 5) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 28) (3, 24) (3, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 27) (14, 26) (26, 14) (26, 10) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 20) (4, 28) (4, 3) (4, 16) (16, 4) (16, 8) (10, 26) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 25) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 25) (0, 8) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 3) (24, 2) (6, 17) (6, 25) (17, 7) (17, 6) (8, 16) (8, 0) (1, 22) (1, 20) (20, 5) (20, 19) (20, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 0) (25, 6) (25, 2) (2, 21) (2, 24) (2, 25) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three edges:
   - Node 5 has edges to nodes 9, 25, and 28.
   - Node 9 has edges to nodes 5, 29, and 15.
   - Node 7 has edges to nodes 21, 29, and 14.
   - Node 21 has edges to nodes 7, 2, and 29.
   - Node 22 has edges to nodes 23, 27, and 1.
   - Node 23 has edges to nodes 22, 18, and 24.
   - Node 12 has edges to nodes 27, 13, and 24.
   - Node 4 has edges to nodes 28, 3, and 16.
   - Node 16 has edges to nodes 4, 8, and 0.
   - Node 26 has edges to nodes 14, 10, and 0.
   - Node 18 has edges to nodes 23, 12, and 19.
   - Node 19 has edges to nodes 9, 18, and 20.
   - Node 1 has edges to nodes 22, 20, and 15.
   - Node 20 has edges to nodes 5, 19, and 1.
   - Node 15 has edges to nodes 9, 18, and 0.
   - Node 13 has edges to nodes 12, 10, and 25.
   - Node 25 has edges to nodes 5, 10, and 0.
   - Node 2 has edges to nodes 21, 24, and 25.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - There are <5, (9, 25, 28)> and <9, (5, 29, 15)>.
   
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
