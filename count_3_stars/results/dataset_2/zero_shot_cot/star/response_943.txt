Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 2) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 19) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 16) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 6) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 18) (14, 9) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0: 11, 5, 8
- Node 1: 18, 8
- Node 2: 3, 15, 17, 16
- Node 3: 17, 6, 2
- Node 4: 15, 9, 6
- Node 5: 15, 0, 18
- Node 6: 3, 12, 4, 8, 19
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 0, 7, 1, 6
- Node 9: 16, 18, 4, 14
- Node 10: 17, 12, 19
- Node 11: 0, 13
- Node 12: 10, 16, 6
- Node 13: 11, 14
- Node 14: 9, 13
- Node 15: 5, 4, 2
- Node 16: 12, 2, 9, 19
- Node 17: 3, 10, 2
- Node 18: 9, 5, 1
- Node 19: 10, 16, 6

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars:

[<16, (2, 9, 19)>, <2, (3, 17, 16)>, <6, (3, 12, 19)>]
