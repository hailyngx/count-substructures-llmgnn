Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step:
1. Central node 5: (5, 9), (5, 4), (5, 0) -> <5, (9, 4, 0)>
2. Central node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1) -> <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>
3. Central node 4: (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 6) -> <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>
4. Central node 7: (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 2) -> <7, (4, 0, 3)>
5. Central node 1: (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 8) -> <1, (9, 6, 8)>
6. Central node 3: (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7) -> <3, (5, 9, 7)>
7. Central node 8: (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 0) -> <8, (9, 1, 0)>
8. Central node 0: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8) -> <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>,

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 3, 1)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <1, (9, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (9, 1, 0)>, <0, (5, 4, 7)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>.
