Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 23) (25, 0) (25, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 3) (13, 1) (26, 13) (26, 21) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 27) (11, 19) (11, 27) (11, 18) (23, 25) (23, 18) (7, 16) (7, 24) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (3, 13) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 29) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 12) (12, 16) (12, 28) (17, 28) (17, 4) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 8) (21, 2) (21, 24) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 4) (5, 8) (5, 10) (14, 9) (14, 22) (14, 2) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 14) (18, 11) (18, 23) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 11) (29, 3) (24, 7) (24, 3) (24, 21) (24, 10) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 10) (0, 25) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 21) (2, 14) (10, 20) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 24) (10, 4) (6, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's list down all the nodes and their degrees:
- Node 0: Degree 1
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 2: Degree 4
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 2
- Node 6: Degree 1
- Node 7: Degree 2
- Node 8: Degree 3
- Node 9: Degree 5
- Node 10: Degree 5
- Node 11: Degree 3
- Node 12: Degree 2
- Node 13: Degree 4
- Node 14: Degree 3
- Node 15: Degree 1
- Node 16: Degree 4
- Node 17: Degree 2
- Node 18: Degree 2
- Node 19: Degree 3
- Node 20: Degree 5
- Node 21: Degree 5
- Node 22: Degree 3
- Node 23: Degree 2
- Node 24: Degree 4
- Node 25: Degree 3
- Node 26: Degree 2
- Node 27: Degree 3
- Node 28: Degree 3
- Node 29: Degree 1

Now, let's list the 3-stars we can identify from the given graph:
<1, (13, 10, 9)>
<2, (21, 14, 16)>
<3, (13, 24, 28)>
<4, (9, 19, 17)>
<5, (8, 10, 20)>
<6, (20, 22, 25)>
<7, (16, 19, 28)>
<8, (21, 24, 2)>
<9, (1, 10, 9)>
<10, (20, 10, 24)>
<11, (11, 19, 27)>

Hence, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
