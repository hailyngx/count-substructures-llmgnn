Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (4, 10) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 0) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 9) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (15, 11) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 12) (0, 5) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which will form the 3-stars.

Nodes with three connections:
- Node 5: (16, 13, 6)
- Node 9: (14, 18, 1)
- Node 12: (17, 5, 3)
- Node 0: (19, 5, 0)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph: 

[(4)] 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (16, 13, 6)>
<9, (14, 18, 1)>
<12, (17, 5, 3)>
<0, (19, 5, 0)>
