Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star one by one. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go through each node in the graph and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 5)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 1), (2, 0, 6)
- Node 3: No 3-star as it has only 1 edge
- Node 4: (4, 6, 7), (4, 6, 9), (4, 5, 9), (4, 5, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 4, 0), (5, 4, 8), (5, 8, 9), (5, 8, 4)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 0), (6, 1, 7), (6, 4, 7), (6, 4, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 2, 1), (7, 2, 6), (7, 3, 6), (7, 3, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 5, 4), (8, 5, 9), (8, 7, 4), (8, 7, 3)
- Node 9: (9, 8, 5), (9, 8, 4), (9, 4, 5), (9, 4, 6)

Therefore, counting the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of 16 3-stars.
