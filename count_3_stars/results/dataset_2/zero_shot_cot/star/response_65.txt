Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 19) (5, 3) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 15) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

We know that a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. We need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Based on the given information, the node-degree distribution is as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 1
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 5
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 1
- Node 19: degree 3

From the node-degree distribution, we can identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure:
- Node 7, connected to nodes 12, 11, and 19
- Node 14, connected to nodes 8, 18, and 13
- Node 15, connected to nodes 17, 2, and 16

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <7, (12, 11, 19)>, <14, (8, 18, 13)>, <15, (17, 2, 16)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
