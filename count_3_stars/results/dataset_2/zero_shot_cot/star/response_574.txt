Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 25) (14, 13) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (0, 27) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 3) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 26) (23, 0) (23, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 12) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 11) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 2) (28, 11) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 1) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 18) (26, 8) (26, 10) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 21) (21, 16) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 25) (10, 13) (10, 26) (10, 2) (24, 17) (24, 19) (24, 29) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 1) (19, 23) (19, 24) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (7, 14) (7, 20) (7, 5) (12, 20) (12, 1) (12, 21) (12, 29) (29, 22) (29, 24) (29, 12) (5, 21) (5, 7) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 21) (3, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree 3). We have:
- Node 13 (connected to 10, 14, 22)
- Node 22 (connected to 15, 17, 29)
- Node 14 (connected to 13, 17, 7)
- Node 17 (connected to 22, 14, 16)
- Node 6 (connected to 9, 4, 16)
- Node 9 (connected to 6, 8, 18)
- Node 27 (connected to 0, 4, 3)
- Node 8 (connected to 9, 25, 26)
- Node 0 (connected to 27, 23)
- Node 23 (connected to 0, 19)
- Node 20 (connected to 15, 7, 12)
- Node 15 (connected to 22, 20, 11)
- Node 11 (connected to 15, 28, 2)
- Node 28 (connected to 11)
- Node 4 (connected to 6, 27, 2, 1)
- Node 1 (connected to 4, 16, 12, 18)
- Node 26 (connected to 8, 10)
- Node 16 (connected to 17, 6, 1, 21)
- Node 21 (connected to 16, 12, 5, 25)
- Node 10 (connected to 13, 26, 2)
- Node 24 (connected to 17, 19, 29)
- Node 18 (connected to 17, 9, 1)
- Node 19 (connected to 23, 24)
- Node 2 (connected to 11, 4, 10)
- Node 7 (connected to 14, 20, 5)
- Node 12 (connected to 20, 1, 21, 29)
- Node 29 (connected to 22, 24, 12)

Next, let's list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<13, (10, 14, 22)>
<22, (15, 17, 29)>
<14, (13, 17, 7)>
<17, (22, 14, 16)>
<6, (9, 4, 16)>
<9, (6, 8, 18)>
<27, (0, 4, 3)>
<8, (9, 25, 26)>
<0, (27, 23)>
<23, (0, 19)>
<20, (15, 7, 12)>
<15, (22, 20, 11)>
<11, (15, 28, 2)>
<4, (6, 27, 2)>
<1, (4, 16, 12)>
<26, (8, 10)>
<16, (17, 6, 1)>
<21, (16, 12, 5)>
<10, (13, 26, 2)>
<24, (17, 19, 29)>
<18, (17, 9, 1)>
<19, (23, 24)>
<2, (11, 4, 10)>
<7, (14, 20, 5)>
<12, (20, 1, 21)>
<29, (22, 24, 12)>
<5, (21, 7)>
<25, (8, 21)>
<3, (27)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [<27>] 3-stars in the given graph.
