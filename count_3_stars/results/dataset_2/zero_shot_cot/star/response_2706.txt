Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (2, 0) (2, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this graph. Let's find and count them:

1. <4, (11, 12, 14)>
2. <7, (10, 13, 8)>
3. <8, (13, 6, 11)>
4. <13, (7, 9, 10)>
5. <10, (7, 13, 0)>
6. <11, (4, 8, 3)>
7. <12, (4, 8, 7)>
8. <0, (4, 5, 14)>
9. <14, (4, 0, 9)>
10. <3, (8, 11, 6)>
11. <1, (12, 5, 9)>
12. <6, (8, 3, 1)>
13. <2, (0, 1, 5)>
14. <5, (11, 0, 3)>
15. <9, (13, 1, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
