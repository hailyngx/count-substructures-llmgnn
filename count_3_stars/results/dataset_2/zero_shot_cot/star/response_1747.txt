Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Counting the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 8, 7)>
<1, (3, 11, 14)>
<2, (5, 9, 11)>
<4, (6, 11, 14)>
<5, (2, 7, 13)>
<7, (5, 10, 12)>
<8, (0, 9, 13)>
<10, (6, 8, 14)>
<11, (1, 3, 4)>
<13, (5, 8, 10)>
<14, (1, 6, 10)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
