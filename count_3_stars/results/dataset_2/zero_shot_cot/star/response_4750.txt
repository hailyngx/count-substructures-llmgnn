Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to identify the 3-star structures. 

First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 9, 7, 3)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 6, 8, 2)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 4, 0, 8)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 9, 1, 3)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For Node 6:
   <6, (9, 7, 3)>
   <6, (9, 2, 8)>

2. For Node 9:
   <9, (6, 7, 8)>
   <9, (6, 2, 0)>

3. For Node 1:
   <1, (4, 0, 8)>

4. For Node 0:
   <0, (9, 1, 3)>
   
Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
