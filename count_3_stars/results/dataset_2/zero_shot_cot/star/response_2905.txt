Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 since it has the highest degree:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 8, and 4.

Next, let's identify the non-5 neighbors of each of these nodes:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 4, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 7, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 3, and 5.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars present in the graph:
- Number of 3-stars with the center at node 5: 4 (Each of the non-5 neighbors forms a 3-star with 5 as the center)
- Number of 3-stars with the center at node 9: 4
- Number of 3-stars with the center at node 2: 3
- Number of 3-stars with the center at node 8: 4
- Number of 3-stars with the center at node 4: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 19. 
[19]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
