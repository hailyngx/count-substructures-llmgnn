Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. The center node must have exactly three neighbors. 
From the given edges, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8. 

Now, we will list the 3-stars in the graph:
- <6, (1, 2, 8)>
- <1, (6, 3, 4)>
- <3, (9, 1, 7)>
- <4, (9, 1, 7)>
- <7, (9, 1, 3)>
- <8, (6, 9, 3)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
