Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify nodes that are connected in the specific way required for a 3-star graph. 

Let's go step by step:
1. For each node, check if it has exactly 3 neighboring nodes.
2. For each node with exactly 3 neighbors, check if it forms a 3-star structure.

Nodes with 3 neighbors are: 
- Node 5: (9, 1, 0) 
- Node 9: (5, 6, 4) 
- Node 6: (9, 1, 3) 
- Node 4: (9, 8, 0) 
- Node 8: (4, 3, 7) 
- Node 2: (4, 1, 3) 
- Node 0: (5, 4, 2) 
- Node 7: (9, 8, 0) 
- Node 1: (5, 6, 2) 
- Node 3: (5, 6, 4, 8, 2, 0)

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (4, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<0, (5, 4, 2)>
<7, (9, 8, 0)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
