Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 14) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connecting to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars by examining each node's connections:

<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<13, (4, 9, 8)>
<10, (0, 1, 4)>
<12, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<11, (2, 6, 2)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 11, 12)>
<7, (2, 8, 12)>
<14, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (3, 7, 13)>

Now, we have found all the unique 3-stars in the graph. As we have found 11 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].
