Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 5:

Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9. Therefore, there are 5 possible 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

Then, we identify the nodes that are connected to node 1:

Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 2. Since node 5 is already a part of a 3-star with node 1 as the center, we can't form additional 3-stars with node 1.

Next, we look at the nodes connected to node 9:

Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 3. Node 4 is part of a 3-star with node 9 as the center, so we can't form another 3-star with node 9.

Moving on to node 6, it is only connected to nodes 7, 2, 4, and 0. None of these connections form a 3-star.

Node 0 is connected to only node 6, but we already checked that case.

Finally, we consider node 8:

Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 3. Node 5 and 7 are already part of 3-stars, so we cannot form an additional 3-star with node 8.

So, in total, we have found 5 unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, and <5, (1, 3, 9)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
