Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the list of edges and identify the 3-stars:
- Central node 0: (0, 2, 4, 5)
- Central node 1: (1, 4, 6, 8)
- Central node 3: (3, 5, 7, 9)
- Central node 4: (4, 0, 1, 6)
- Central node 6: (6, 1, 4, 8)
- Central node 7: (7, 2, 3, 8)
- Central node 8: (8, 0, 1, 2)
- Central node 9: (9, 1, 3, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
