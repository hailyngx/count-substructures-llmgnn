Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 2, 0)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
