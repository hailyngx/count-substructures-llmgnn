Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors and treat it as the center of a 3-star. 

The nodes and their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: (1, 2, 3)
- Node 1: (0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 2: (0, 1, 4, 5)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 4, 9)
- Node 4: (2, 3, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 5: (2, 7, 8)
- Node 6: (1, 4, 9)
- Node 7: (1, 4, 5, 8)
- Node 8: (1, 4, 5, 7)
- Node 9: (1, 3, 6)

Based on the neighbors and the definition of a 3-star graph, we can identify the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [9].
