Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 0.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
