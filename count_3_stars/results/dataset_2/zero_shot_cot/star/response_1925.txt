Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 15) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 7) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 18) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 10) (18, 16) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 17) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 17) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 8) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 12) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

1. Central Node: 0
   Adjacent Nodes: 4, 5, 10, 16

2. Central Node: 3
   Adjacent Nodes: 8, 11
   
3. Central Node: 5
   Adjacent Nodes: 0, 8, 19

4. Central Node: 6
   Adjacent Nodes: 9, 15

5. Central Node: 7
   Adjacent Nodes: 8, 9, 14

6. Central Node: 8
   Adjacent Nodes: 3, 5, 7, 10, 17

7. Central Node: 9
   Adjacent Nodes: 6, 7, 14, 17

8. Central Node: 12
   Adjacent Nodes: 13, 16, 17, 19

9. Central Node: 14
   Adjacent Nodes: 1, 7, 9

10. Central Node: 15
    Adjacent Nodes: 4, 6, 16

11. Central Node: 16
    Adjacent Nodes: 0, 12, 15, 17, 18

12. Central Node: 17
    Adjacent Nodes: 2, 8, 9, 12, 16

13. Central Node: 19
    Adjacent Nodes: 1, 5, 11, 12

14. Central Node: 1
    Adjacent Nodes: 14, 19

15. Central Node: 2
    Adjacent Nodes: 17

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph, which are:
<0, (4, 5, 10)>
<3, (8, 11, *)>
<5, (0, 8, 19)>
<6, (9, 15, *)>
<7, (8, 9, 14)>
<8, (3, 5, 10)>
<9, (6, 7, 14)>
<12, (13, 16, 17)>
<16, (0, 12, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
