Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 7, and 12.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 10, 13, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 10, 12, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 0, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 8, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 1, and 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 10, 1, 7.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 11, 13, 2.
- Node 11 is connected to node 10.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 2, 7, 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 0, 4.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- There are 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (9, 3, 7)>, <1, (9, 3, 12)>
- There are 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (5, 6, 10)>, <2, (5, 10, 13)>, <2, (5, 10, 0)>
- There are 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (5, 1, 10)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>
- There is 1 3-star with node 4 as the center: <4, (9, 6, 0)>
- There are 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 2, 3)>
- There are 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (9, 7, 4)>, <6, (9, 7, 2)>
- There are 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (9, 1, 13)>
- There is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (5, 3, 14)>
- There are 6 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 1, 7)>, <9, (5, 1, 3)>, <9, (5, 1, 12)>, <9, (5, 2, 8)>, <9, (5, 2, 3)>
- There are 4 3-stars with node 10 as the center: <10, (9, 3, 11)>, <10, (9, 3, 13)>, <10, (9, 3, 13)>, <10, (2, 13, 7)>
- There is 1 3-star with node 12 as the center: <12, (1, 3, 14)>
- There is 1 3-star with node 13 as the center: <13, (10, 2, 7)>
- There is 1 3-star with node 14 as the center: <14, (8, 3, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
