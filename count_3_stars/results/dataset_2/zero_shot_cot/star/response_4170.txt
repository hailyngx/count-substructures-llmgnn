Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 28) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 16) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (7, 11) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 20) (23, 0) (8, 1) (18, 13) (18, 22) (18, 3) (15, 2) (15, 26) (15, 14) (20, 11) (20, 19) (20, 16) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 26) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 5) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 15) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 24) (6, 13) (28, 2) (28, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 25) (1, 12) (3, 18) (3, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 3) (21, 27) (17, 16) (17, 27) (25, 4) (25, 1) (25, 12) (16, 29) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 17) (24, 5) (24, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 24) (27, 13) (27, 19) (27, 21) (27, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 13
   Leaves: 22, 12, 27
   <13, (22, 12, 27)>

2. Central node: 22
   Leaves: 13, 18, 21
   <22, (13, 18, 21)>

3. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 29, 5, 28
   <2, (29, 5, 28)>

4. Central node: 4
   Leaves: 9, 28, 25
   <4, (9, 28, 25)>

5. Central node: 7
   Leaves: 11, 9, (No other leaf connected)
   <7, (11, 9)>

6. Central node: 10
   Leaves: 11, 21, 1
   <10, (11, 21, 1)>

7. Central node: 11
   Leaves: 7, 10, 12
   <11, (7, 10, 12)>

8. Central node: 20
   Leaves: 11, 19, 16
   <20, (11, 19, 16)>

9. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 23, 14, 26
   <0, (23, 14, 26)>

10. Central node: 14
    Leaves: 15, 0, 5
    <14, (15, 0, 5)>

11. Central node: 19
    Leaves: 20, 26, 27
    <19, (20, 26, 27)>

12. Central node: 5
    Leaves: 2, 14, 26
    <5, (2, 14, 26)>

13. Central node: 28
    Leaves: 2, 4, (No other leaf connected)
    <28, (2, 4)>

14. Central node: 1
   Leaves: 10, 8, 25
   <1, (10, 8, 25)>

15. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 18, 21, (No other leaf connected)
   <3, (18, 21)>

16. Central node: 21
   Leaves: 22, 10, 3
   <21, (22, 10, 3)>

17. Central node: 17
   Leaves: 16, 27, (No other leaf connected)
   <17, (16, 27)>

18. Central node: 24
   Leaves: 5, 9, (No other leaf connected)
   <24, (5, 9)>

19. Central node: 9
   Leaves: 4, 7, 24
   <9, (4, 7, 24)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [19]
