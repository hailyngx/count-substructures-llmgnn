Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. 
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 10, and 5.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 11, 14, and 9.
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 4, 11, and 5.
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 7, 10, and 3.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 11, 13, and 9.
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 8, 2, and 0.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 11, 6, and 9.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 13, 1, and 12.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 8, 3, and 1.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 2, and 5.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 2, 5, and 14.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 4, 3, 1, 2, 12, and 14.
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 7, 9, 2, 5, and 12.
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 11, 13, 6, and 12.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<4, (9, 10, 5)>
<7, (11, 14, 9)>
<10, (4, 11, 5)>
<11, (7, 10, 3)>
<8, (11, 13, 9)>
<13, (8, 2, 0)>
<3, (11, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (13, 1, 12)>
<6, (8, 3, 1)>
<1, (6, 2, 5)>
<12, (2, 5, 14)>
<5, (4, 3, 1)>
<14, (7, 9, 2)>
<0, (11, 13, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
