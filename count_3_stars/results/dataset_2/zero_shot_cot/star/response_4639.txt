Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree 3 nodes) to find the 3-stars. These nodes will only appear thrice in the edges if they are part of a 3-star.

The nodes connected to the center node (5) with degree 3 are 9, 13, and 2.

Now, we look for 3-stars by checking each of these nodes and seeing if there are edges connecting them to exactly two other nodes already identified as degree 3 nodes.

For node 9:
- <9, (5, 2, 4)>
- <9, (5, 8, 7)>
  
For node 13:
- <13, (5, 1, 3)>
- <13, (5, 1, 11)>
- <13, (5, 11, 4)>
  
For node 2:
- <2, (5, 13, 0)>
- <2, (5, 8, 12)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
<9, (5, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<13, (5, 1, 3)>
<13, (5, 1, 11)>
<13, (5, 11, 4)>
<2, (5, 13, 0)>
<2, (5, 8, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
