Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all possible 3-stars in the graph.

There are a total of 10 possible center nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).

For each center node, we need to check if there are exactly three other nodes connected to it. Let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 3, 8)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (0, 7, 5)>
- <3, (1, 0, 8)>
- <4, (1, 0, 9)>
- <5, (2, 0, 7)>
- <6, (9, 7, 3)>
- <7, (6, 5, 3)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
- <9, (6, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
