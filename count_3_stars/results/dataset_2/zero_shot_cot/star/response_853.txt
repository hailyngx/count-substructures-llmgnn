Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can create a list of nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 8, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 4
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, 9: <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 5, 8: <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 8: <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, 9: <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 9: <8, (3, 4, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
