Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 29) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 6) (27, 13) (27, 0) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 0) (6, 3) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 16) (12, 21) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 10) (23, 19) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 20) (14, 2) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 17) (28, 17) (26, 22) (26, 10) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 17) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 8) (7, 15) (25, 23) (25, 5) (25, 10) (24, 4) (24, 20) (10, 23) (10, 26) (10, 25) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 16) (15, 1) (15, 11) (15, 7) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 21) (17, 28) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 24) (19, 3) (19, 23) (19, 14) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's express the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (27, 14, 6)>
<1, (18, 3, 15)>
<2, (13, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 21, 20)>
<4, (13, 2, 24)>
<5, (2, 25, 16)>
<6, (3, 0, 6)>
<8, (20, 29, 23)>
<9, (29, 20, 16)>
<10, (23, 26, 25)>
<11, (14, 11, 15)>
<13, (22, 4, 2)>
<14, (0, 19, 11)>
<15, (7, 1, 11)>
<16, (9, 5, 17)>
<17, (21, 28, 16)>
<19, (23, 3, 14)>
<20, (14, 3, 24)>
<21, (3, 17, 12)>
<22, (26, 13, 29)>
<23, (8, 25, 10)>
<25, (23, 5, 10)>
<26, (22, 10, 29)>
<27, (13, 0, 2)>
<29, (22, 8, 9)>

There are 25 unique 3-stars in the graph.
So, the final answer is [25].
