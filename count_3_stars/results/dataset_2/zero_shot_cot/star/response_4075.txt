Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 2) (15, 25) (15, 5) (27, 15) (12, 22) (12, 8) (0, 20) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 22) (20, 6) (1, 26) (1, 8) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 17) (4, 16) (18, 11) (18, 6) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 3) (29, 14) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 3) (25, 15) (25, 23) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (14, 26) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 10) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 21) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 25) (23, 5) (23, 19) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 3) (9, 0) (9, 24) (21, 11) (3, 29) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 22) (10, 24) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 19) (24, 14) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 17) (13, 28) (13, 6) (6, 20) (6, 18) (6, 13) (22, 12) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 10) (19, 23) (19, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (20, 9, 22)>
<1, (26, 8, 7)>
<2, (15, 26, 3)>
<3, (29, 16, 2)>
<4, (16, 28, 7)>
<5, (15, 29, 23)>
<6, (20, 18, 13)>
<7, (1, 16, 10)>
<8, (12, 1, 26)>
<9, (0, 24, 9)>
<10, (7, 14, 3)>
<11, (18, 14, 21)>
<13, (28, 6, 13)>
<14, (26, 29, 11)>
<15, (2, 25, 5)>
<16, (4, 28, 3)>
<17, (26, 24, 19)>
<18, (11, 6, 20)>
<19, (17, 23, 19)>
<20, (0, 22, 6)>
<21, (11, 17, 21)>
<22, (10, 20, 12)>
<23, (5, 19, 23)>
<24, (14, 9, 17)>
<25, (15, 23, 25)>
<26, (1, 2, 17)>
<28, (13, 29, 16)>
<29, (28, 5, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [(29)].
