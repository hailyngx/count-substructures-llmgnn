Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (16, 24) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 24) (23, 24) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 9) (24, 16) (24, 15) (24, 23) (24, 14) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 12) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 29) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 25) (28, 22) (26, 10) (26, 13) (26, 5) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (25, 18) (25, 7) (25, 29) (25, 12) (25, 21) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 3) (21, 4) (21, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (0, 8) (0, 17) (14, 15) (14, 24) (14, 7) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 27) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 25) (12, 2) (9, 23) (9, 13) (9, 1) (6, 22) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 27) (29, 4) (29, 25) (19, 3) (19, 1) (27, 3) (27, 2) (27, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 21, 27, and 19.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 18, 21, and 29.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 25, 14, 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 22, 17, 25, and 2.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 26, 1, and 9.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 15, 24, 7, and 25.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 18, 24, and 14.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 0, 12.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 15, and 25.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 25.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 23, 6, 28, and 12.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 24, 22, 8, and 9.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 7, 18, 29, 12, and 21.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 5.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 6.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 4 and 25.

Next, we can count the number of 3-stars:
- Since each 3-star has a center and three leaves, we can count the number of 3-star patterns directly from the identified nodes.
- There are <3, (15, 21, 27)> and <4, (8, 18, 29)>.
- There are no other unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
