Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 8, 3, 2
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 6, 2
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 3, 0
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 8, 6, 0, 2
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 8, 0, 1, 6
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 2, 3
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, 3
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 6
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 0, 3
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 8, 2, 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- From the connections, we can see that there are 7 possible 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (4, 8, 3)
2. Node 1: (9, 4, 6)
3. Node 2: (5, 9, 1)
4. Node 2: (3, 5, 2)
5. Node 3: (8, 9, 2)
6. Node 4: (7, 8, 4)
7. Node 6: (4, 7, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 8, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (3, 5, 2)>
<3, (8, 9, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 4)>
<6, (4, 7, 6)>
