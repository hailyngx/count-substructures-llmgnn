Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<3, (6, 1, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 0)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 3)>
<9, (0, 6, 2)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[10]
