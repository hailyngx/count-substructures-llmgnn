Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 11) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 12) (11, 17) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and then find out how many of each exist. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars:

<0, (7, 14, 19)>
<1, (4, 13, 17)>
<2, (6, 10, 16)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 14)>
<6, (9, 10, 17)>
<7, (4, 7, 13)>
<9, (6, 12, 18)>
<13, (1, 8, 14)>
<16, (4, 10, 15)>

Now, we count the occurrences of each unique 3-star:

<0, (7, 14, 19)>: 1 occurrence
<1, (4, 13, 17)>: 1 occurrence
<2, (6, 10, 16)>: 1 occurrence
<3, (1, 5, 8)>: 1 occurrence
<5, (3, 4, 14)>: 1 occurrence
<6, (9, 10, 17)>: 1 occurrence
<7, (4, 7, 13)>: 1 occurrence
<9, (6, 12, 18)>: 1 occurrence
<13, (1, 8, 14)>: 1 occurrence
<16, (4, 10, 15)>: 1 occurrence

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
