Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 0) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node with exactly three edges. These nodes are potential leaves of the 3-stars.

Nodes connected to node 0: 2, 4, 6, 8
Nodes connected to node 1: 2, 11, 14
Nodes connected to node 2: 0, 1, 6, 13
Nodes connected to node 3: 6, 9, 10, 11
Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 9, 12, 14
Nodes connected to node 5: 7, 10, 13
Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 2, 3, 8
Nodes connected to node 7: 5, 8, 10, 12
Nodes connected to node 8: 0, 6, 7, 13
Nodes connected to node 9: 3, 4, 11, 12
Nodes connected to node 10: 3, 5, 7
Nodes connected to node 11: 1, 2, 3, 9
Nodes connected to node 12: 4, 7, 9, 13
Nodes connected to node 13: 2, 5, 8, 12
Nodes connected to node 14: 1, 4, 8

After checking all the nodes, we can find the 3-stars in the graph. Each 3-star is represented by the central node and the three connected leaves.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 11, 14)>
<2, (0, 6, 13)>
<3, (6, 9, 10)>
<4, (0, 9, 12)>
<5, (7, 10, 13)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 10)>
<8, (0, 6, 13)>
<9, (3, 11, 12)>
<10, (3, 5, 7)>
<11, (1, 3, 9)>
<12, (4, 7, 9)>
<13, (2, 8, 12)>
<14, (1, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
