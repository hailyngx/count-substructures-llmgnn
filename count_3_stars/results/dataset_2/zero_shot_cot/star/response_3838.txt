Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 3) (5, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 2) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (1, 13) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 16) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 15) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 12) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 15) (11, 4) (3, 18) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, which is a characteristic of the center node in a 3-star graph. Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. <2, (4, 18, 12)>
2. <18, (4, 2, 16)>
3. <4, (2, 18, 16)>
4. <16, (18, 4, 15)>
5. <9, (8, 17, 3)>
6. <12, (2, 14, 3)>
7. <15, (10, 16, 19)>
8. <3, (18, 9, 19)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
