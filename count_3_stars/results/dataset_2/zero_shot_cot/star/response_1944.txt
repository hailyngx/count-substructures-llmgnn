Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (15, 11) (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (18, 23) (18, 17) (22, 19) (22, 21) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 23) (17, 18) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 4) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 21) (20, 13) (28, 0) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 23) (29, 20) (29, 12) (29, 14) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 25) (13, 7) (26, 15) (26, 13) (24, 14) (24, 21) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 6) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 12) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 28) (25, 28) (25, 13) (5, 3) (5, 28) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 15) (2, 9) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 24) (12, 10) (12, 29) (12, 19) (12, 8) (14, 27) (14, 29) (14, 24) (14, 5) (14, 9) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 5) (7, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify nodes that are connected in a 3-star pattern. 
Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 28)>
<2, (9, 15, 2)>
<3, (5, 16, 3)>
<5, (7, 14, 5)>
<7, (9, 14, 7)>
<8, (12, 16, 8)>
<10, (12, 17, 10)>
<13, (20, 25, 13)>
<14, (24, 27, 14)>
<15, (26, 27, 15)>
<16, (3, 8, 16)>
<17, (10, 13, 17)>
<19, (12, 19, 22)>
<20, (13, 21, 20)>
<21, (20, 24, 21)>
<22, (19, 21, 22)>
<23, (17, 28, 23)>
<29, (12, 14, 29)>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the graph.
