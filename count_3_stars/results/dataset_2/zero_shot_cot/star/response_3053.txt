Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
First, identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 7, 9, and 5)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 4, 0, and 8)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 7, 5, and 1)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 4, 7, and 2)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 4, 0, and 1)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 5, and 2)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 7, 6, and 3)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 9, 6, and 3)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- <4, (7, 9, 5)>
- <7, (4, 0, 8)>
- <0, (7, 5, 1)>
- <6, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <9, (4, 7, 2)>
- <5, (4, 0, 1)>
- <1, (0, 5, 2)>
- <8, (7, 6, 3)>
- <2, (9, 6, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars shown above, we find that there are 10 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
