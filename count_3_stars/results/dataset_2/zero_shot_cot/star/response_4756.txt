Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 3) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 6:
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5

Now, we can see that there are four 3-stars centered around node 6:
- <6, (5, 1, 3)>
- <6, (5, 4, 6)>
- <6, (3, 5, 6)>
- <6, (4, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
