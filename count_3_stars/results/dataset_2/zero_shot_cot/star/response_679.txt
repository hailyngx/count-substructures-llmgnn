Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 5: <5, (6, 2, 1)>
2. Node 6: <6, (5, 9, 14)>
3. Node 1: <1, (5, 3, 11)>
4. Node 9: <9, (6, 11, 14)>
5. Node 3: <3, (1, 10, 12)>
6. Node 4: <4, (7, 10, 0)>
7. Node 7: <7, (6, 4, 10)>
8. Node 12: <12, (9, 6, 3)>
9. Node 2: <2, (5, 12, 13)>
10. Node 8: <8, (1, 14, 11)>
11. Node 11: <11, (9, 6, 1)>
12. Node 0: <0, (4, 8, 13)>
13. Node 10: <10, (5, 3, 4)>
14. Node 14: <14, (9, 6, 2)>
15. Node 13: <13, (1, 2, 0)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
