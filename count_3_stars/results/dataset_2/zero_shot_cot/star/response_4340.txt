Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star. 

Let's start by identifying the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 5, 8, 9, 11
- Node 1 has neighbors: 8, 11, 14
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 5, 11, 13, 14
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 10, 13, 14
- Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 10, 12
- Node 6 has neighbors: 7, 13, 14
- Node 7 has neighbors: 6, 8, 12, 14
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 1, 7
- Node 9 has neighbors: 0, 10, 11, 12
- Node 10 has neighbors: 3, 4, 9, 12, 13
- Node 11 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 12 has neighbors: 4, 7, 9, 10, 13
- Node 13 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 10, 12
- Node 14 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (8, 11, 14)>
<2, (0, 5, 11)>
<3, (10, 13, 14)>
<4, (12, 10, 3)>
<6, (7, 13, 14)>
<7, (12, 8, 14)>
<8, (1, 7, 0)>
<9, (0, 12, 11)>
<10, (3, 13, 12)>
<11, (9, 1, 0)>
<12, (4, 9, 7)>
<13, (10, 6, 12)>
<14, (1, 6, 3)>

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
