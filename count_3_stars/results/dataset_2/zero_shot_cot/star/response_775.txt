Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 14) (15, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 18) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 17) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 6) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of times a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's start by identifying all the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:

1. Nodes connected to 3 other nodes:
- Node 3: (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 18), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 13), (5, 4), (5, 7), (4, 5)
- Node 6: (6, 10), (6, 18), (6, 2), (6, 12)
- Node 8: (8, 13), (8, 14), (8, 3), (13, 8)
- Node 9: (9, 11), (9, 4), (9, 2), (11, 9), (4, 9), (2, 9)
- Node 10: (10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 12), (0, 10)
- Node 11: (11, 19), (11, 14), (11, 9), (11, 4), (14, 11)
- Node 12: (12, 0), (12, 10), (12, 6), (0, 12)
- Node 14: (14, 8), (14, 19), (14, 11), (14, 18), (19, 14)
- Node 16: (16, 0), (16, 2), (2, 16)
- Node 17: (17, 9), (17, 2), (2, 17)
- Node 18: (18, 3), (18, 14), (18, 6), (6, 18)
- Node 19: (19, 1), (19, 11), (19, 14), (1, 19)

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph based on the identified nodes above:

[<3, (7, 5, 2)>, <5, (13, 4, 7)>, <8, (13, 14, 3)>, <9, (11, 4, 2)>, <10, (0, 6, 12)>, <11, (19, 14, 9)>, <12, (0, 10, 6)>, <14, (8, 19, 11)>, <16, (0, 2, 17)>, <18, (3, 14, 6)>, <19, (1, 11, 14)>]
