Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-star graphs.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 14, and 4.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 3.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 0.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 10, 2, and 13.

Next, we list the unique 3-star configurations:
<6, (5, 14, 4)>
<11, (10, 14, 2)>
<2, (11, 12, 7)>
<4, (6, 2, 3)>
<12, (9, 2, 8)>
<1, (10, 8, 0)>
<13, (10, 3, 12)>
<7, (10, 2, 13)>

Finally, we count the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph:
