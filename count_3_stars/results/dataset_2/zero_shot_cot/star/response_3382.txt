Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 27) (9, 7) (9, 27) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 18) (12, 26) (27, 6) (27, 9) (27, 26) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 20) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 26) (21, 4) (28, 10) (28, 21) (28, 24) (19, 8) (19, 22) (19, 25) (26, 12) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 16) (7, 9) (7, 25) (7, 29) (25, 19) (25, 7) (3, 21) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 29) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 0) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 29) (2, 6) (2, 11) (22, 14) (22, 19) (22, 16) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 20) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 5) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 1) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 20) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 1) (16, 4) (0, 23) (0, 5) (0, 18) (13, 3) (13, 20) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 0) (20, 10) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 13) (4, 21) (4, 5) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<6, (2, 18, 27)>
<9, (7, 27, 26)>
<14, (17, 22, 8)>
<17, (14, 8, 18)>
<10, (23, 28, 20)>
<21, (28, 3, 26)>
<28, (21, 24, 10)>
<19, (8, 22, 25)>
<26, (12, 27, 21)>
<7, (9, 25, 29)>
<0, (23, 5, 18)>
<16, (26, 22, 1)>
<13, (3, 20, 5)>


To count the number of 3-stars, we calculate the number of unique central nodes:
11

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
