Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, making them potential centers of 3-stars. Based on the given edges, we have the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 1: 3, 11, 14, 13, 4
- Node 3: 1, 0, 14, 6, 5
- Node 10: 7, 2, 9, 14
- Node 11: 1, 13, 6, 8
- Node 8: 11, 4, 14, 7
- Node 13: 1, 11, 2
- Node 4: 1, 8, 2, 6
- Node 5: 3, 6, 12, 0, 7
- Node 6: 3, 11, 4, 5, 0
- Node 7: 10, 8, 5
- Node 12: 5, 9
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 14
- Node 14: 1, 3, 10, 8, 0, 9
- Node 9: 10, 12
- Node 2: 10, 13, 4

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 13)>
<3, (1, 0, 5)>
<10, (7, 2, 9)>
<11, (6, 8, 13)>
<8, (11, 4, 14)>
<13, (1, 11, 2)>
<4, (1, 8, 2)>
<5, (3, 6, 12)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (10, 8, 5)>
<12, (5, 9, 0)>
<0, (3, 5, 14)>
<14, (1, 8, 0)>
<9, (10, 12, 14)>
<2, (10, 13, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
