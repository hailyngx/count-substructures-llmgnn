Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Starting from the center node, we can count the number of 3-stars by checking for each possible combination of three leaf nodes connected to the center node. 

1. Center node 5: 
   - Leaves: (1, 6, 9), (0, 6, 9)
   
2. Center node 9:
   - Leaves: (2, 4, 3)

3. Center node 4:
   - Leaves: No 3-stars
   
4. Center node 7:
   - Leaves: No 3-stars
   
5. Center node 1:
   - Leaves: (3, 6, 8)

6. Center node 3:
   - Leaves: No 3-stars

7. Center node 8:
   - Leaves: No 3-stars

8. Center node 6:
   - Leaves: No 3-stars

9. Center node 0:
   - Leaves: (2, 3, 4)

2 unique 3-stars found: <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
