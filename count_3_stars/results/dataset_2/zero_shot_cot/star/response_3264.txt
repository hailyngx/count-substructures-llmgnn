Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 0) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (12, 10) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 14:
   <9, (5, 6, 14)>

2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 11:
   <4, (7, 8, 11)>

3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 14:
   <7, (4, 10, 14)>

4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 3:
   <6, (9, 10, 3)>

5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 12:
   <10, (7, 6, 12)>

6. Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 1:
   <14, (9, 7, 1)>

7. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 11:
   <2, (9, 7, 11)>

8. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 13:
   <0, (6, 3, 13)>

9. Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 14:
   <13, (9, 10, 14)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: 
[9]
