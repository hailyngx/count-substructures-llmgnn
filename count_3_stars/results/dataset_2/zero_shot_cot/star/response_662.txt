Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star structures:
- Node 5 has edges connected to nodes 6, 8, and 4.
- Node 6 has edges connected to nodes 5, 1, and 8.
- Node 4 has edges connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1.
- Node 9 has edges connected to nodes 4, 2, and 7.
- Node 1 has edges connected to nodes 3, 6, and 4.
- Node 3 has edges connected to nodes 1, 7, and 0.
- Node 8 has edges connected to nodes 5, 0, and 6.
- Node 0 has edges connected to nodes 9, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 has edges connected to nodes 9, 3, and 6.
- Node 7 has edges connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3.

There are 10 nodes in total, and each node can be the central node of a 3-star structure. We need to count each unique 3-star structure without repeating. Let's calculate:

- For node 5: <5, (6, 8, 4)>
- For node 6: <6, (5, 1, 8)>
- For node 4: <4, (5, 9, 1)>
- For node 9: <9, (4, 2, 7)>
- For node 1: <1, (3, 6, 4)>
- For node 3: <3, (1, 7, 0)>
- For node 8: <8, (5, 0, 6)>
- For node 0: <0, (9, 3, 8)>
- For node 2: <2, (9, 3, 6)>
- For node 7: <7, (5, 9, 3)>

Total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
