Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 16) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (17, 19) (17, 18) (17, 11) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 3) (18, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 3) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars present. 

Looking at the given edges, we can see the following 3-stars in the graph:
1. <4, (9, 0, 19)>
2. <5, (12, 14, 6)>
3. <11, (14, 17, 7)>
4. <16, (9, 2, 15)>
5. <18, (17, 3, 10)>

Now, we will count the total number of unique 3-stars listed above.

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the total count of 3-stars is [5].
