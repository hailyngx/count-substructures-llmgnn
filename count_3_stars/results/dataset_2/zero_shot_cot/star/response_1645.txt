Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (8, 2, 10)>
<1, (6, 3, 11)>
<2, (8, 12, 11)>
<3, (6, 1, 10)>
<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<5, (9, 8, 14)>
<6, (1, 10, 12)>
<7, (4, 11, 8)>
<8, (5, 0, 2)>
<9, (5, 14, 13)>
<10, (6, 3, 4)>
<11, (1, 4, 2)>
<12, (6, 10, 2)>
<13, (9, 14, 13)>
<14, (9, 1, 13)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we get [14].
