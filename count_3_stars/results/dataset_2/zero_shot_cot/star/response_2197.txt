Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 9) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by considering each node as the center of the star and counting the number of 3-stars around it. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars by considering each node:

1. Node 0:
- <0, (6, 7, 12)> 
- <0, (1, 3, 12)> 
(2 3-stars)

2. Node 1:
- <1, (0, 4, 5)> 
- <1, (11, 12, 13)> 
(2 3-stars)

3. Node 2:
- <2, (6, 7, 8)> 
(1 3-star)

4. Node 3:
- <3, (0, 8, 13)> 
(1 3-star)

5. Node 4:
- <4, (1, 9, 11)> 
(1 3-star)

6. Node 5:
- <5, (1, 6, 13)> 
(1 3-star)

7. Node 6:
- <6, (0, 2, 5)> 
(1 3-star)

8. Node 7:
- <7, (0, 9, 12)> 
(1 3-star)

9. Node 8:
- <8, (0, 2, 13)> 
(1 3-star)

10. Node 9:
- <9, (4, 7, 14)> 
(1 3-star)

11. Node 10:
- <10, (11, 12, 14)> 
(1 3-star)

12. Node 11:
- <11, (1, 4, 10)> 
(1 3-star)

13. Node 12:
- <12, (0, 1, 7)> 
(1 3-star)

14. Node 13:
- <13, (1, 3, 5)> 
(1 3-star)

15. Node 14:
- <14, (9, 10, 9)> 
(1 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
