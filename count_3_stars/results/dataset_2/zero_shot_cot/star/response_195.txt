Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 16) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The potential central nodes for a 3-star are: 5, 9, 3, 11, 8, 12, 0, 10, 7, 17, 19, 6, 1, 14, 13, 15.

<b>Identified 3-stars:</b>
<5, (9, 0, 16)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<3, (11, 7, 17)>
<11, (3, 7, 12)>
<8, (9, 6, 16)>
<0, (5, 10, 13)>
<10, (0, 14, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 11)>
<17, (4, 3, 15)>
<19, (3, 2, 6)>
<6, (8, 19, 15)>
<1, (18, 14, 1)>
<14, (10, 7, 1)>
<13, (0, 2, 13)>
<15, (18, 16, 6)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [15]
