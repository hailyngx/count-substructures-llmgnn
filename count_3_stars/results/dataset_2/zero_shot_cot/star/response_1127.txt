Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 15) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (9, 15) (9, 7) (2, 29) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 10) (22, 29) (22, 23) (22, 5) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 27) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 20) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 20) (0, 3) (0, 17) (1, 6) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 12) (26, 1) (28, 6) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 21) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (21, 29) (21, 18) (21, 5) (13, 3) (17, 2) (17, 0) (17, 3) (17, 27) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 27) (19, 4) (15, 16) (15, 9) (27, 6) (27, 23) (27, 17) (27, 24) (12, 20) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 14) (14, 4) (14, 12) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them first:

Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 7, and 8.
Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 10.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 28, 1, and 27.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and no other node.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 29, 17, and no other node.
Node 29 is connected to nodes 2, 25, and 22.
Node 22 is connected to nodes 29, 23, and 5.
Node 23 is connected to nodes 22, 18, and 27.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 19, and 24.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 9, and 4.
Node 20 is connected to nodes 7, 25, and 12.
Node 25 is connected to nodes 11, 29, and 20.
Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 17, and no other node.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 26, and 10.
Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, no other node.
Node 28 is connected to nodes 6, no other node.
Node 18 is connected to nodes 23, 12, and 21.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 17, and 13.
Node 21 is connected to nodes 29, 18, and 5.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, no other node.
Node 17 is connected to nodes 2, 0, and 3.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 16, and 24.
Node 24 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 27.
Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, no other node.
Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 9, and no other node.
Node 27 is connected to nodes 6, 23, 17, and 24.
Node 12 is connected to nodes 20, 1, 18, and 14.
Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and no other node.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 22, 21, and 10.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 16, 29, 22, 1, and 5.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[<6, (1, 28, 27)>, <29, (2, 25, 22)>, <22, (29, 23, 5)>, <23, (22, 18, 27)>, <7, (11, 9, 4)>, <21, (29, 18, 5)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
