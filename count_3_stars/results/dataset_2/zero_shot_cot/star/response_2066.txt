Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can visualize each unique 3-star configuration and then count how many times each configuration appears in the graph. Let's calculate this step by step.

1. First, let's find all the 3-star configurations:
   - (0, 4, 8), (0, 1, 14), (2, 6, 9),
   - (3, 7, 13), (5, 8, 11), (6, 7, 9),
   - (10, 1, 4), (12, 7, 9), (12, 11, 13)

2. Count the occurrences of each 3-star configuration in the graph:
   - (0, 4, 8): 1
   - (0, 1, 14): 1
   - (2, 6, 9): 2
   - (3, 7, 13): 1
   - (5, 8, 11): 1
   - (6, 7, 9): 2
   - (10, 1, 4): 1
   - (12, 7, 9): 1
   - (12, 11, 13): 1

3. Finally, count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   - Total unique 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the final answer is [9]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 8>, <0, 1, 14>, <2, 6, 9>, <3, 7, 13>, <5, 8, 11>, <6, 7, 9>, <10, 1, 4>, <12, 7, 9>, <12, 11, 13>
