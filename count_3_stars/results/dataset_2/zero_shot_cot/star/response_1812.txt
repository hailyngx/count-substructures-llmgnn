Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 26) (4, 20) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 9) (7, 2) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 25) (1, 3) (1, 16) (10, 0) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 0) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 21) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 11) (6, 21) (6, 24) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 29) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 13) (26, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (28, 7) (28, 26) (28, 14) (20, 4) (20, 9) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 26) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 19) (2, 7) (2, 23) (2, 19) (2, 25) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 18) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 24) (13, 12) (25, 23) (25, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 20) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph based on the provided edges.
1. For node 0: 
   - <0, (12, 17, 27)>
   - <0, (9, 10, 17)>
2. For node 2: 
   - <2, (7, 19, 23)>
3. For node 3: 
   - <3, (1, 5, 22)>
4. For node 5: 
   - <5, (3, 11, 22)>
5. For node 7: 
   - <7, (2, 9, 28)>
   - <7, (9, 15, 28)>
6. For node 9: 
   - <9, (0, 7, 20)>
   - <9, (7, 17, 20)>
7. For node 10: 
   - <10, (0, 17, 8)>
8. For node 14:
   - <14, (2, 18, 28)>
9. For node 16: 
   - <16, (1, 19, 24)>
   - <16, (16, 17, 21)>
10. For node 17: 
   - <17, (0, 10, 21)>
   - <17, (7, 16, 21)>
11. For node 21: 
   - <21, (6, 16, 24)>
   - <21, (16, 17, 29)>
12. For node 22: 
   - <22, (3, 5, 29)>
13. For node 23: 
   - <23, (2, 25, 8)>
14. For node 24: 
   - <24, (6, 13, 16)>
15. For node 26: 
   - <26, (27, 28, 29)>
16. For node 28: 
   - <28, (7, 14, 26)>
17. For node 29: 
   - <29, (21, 22, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
