Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<3, (2, 9, 4)>
<8, (1, 6, 2)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
