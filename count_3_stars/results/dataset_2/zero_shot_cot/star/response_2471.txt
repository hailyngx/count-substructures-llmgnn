Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
