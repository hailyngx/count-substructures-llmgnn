Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 18) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 15) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (18, 8) (18, 6) (18, 5) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 9) (19, 15) (3, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 15) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 18) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (8, 15, 16)>
2. <2, (10, 15, 17)>
3. <3, (0, 15, 19)>
4. <5, (1, 12, 18)>
5. <6, (4, 11, 14)>
6. <7, (9, 16, 17)>
7. <13, (9, 12, 17)>
8. <14, (1, 6, 15)>
9. <18, (5, 6, 8)>
10. <19, (9, 15, 17)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [10].
