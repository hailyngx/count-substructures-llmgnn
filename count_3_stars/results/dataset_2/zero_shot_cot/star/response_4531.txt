Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 neighbors each. These nodes will be the center of our 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are:
- Node 5: connected to nodes 7, 3, 8, 4, and 14
- Node 8: connected to nodes 10, 11, 5, and 14
- Node 13: connected to nodes 6, 7, 12, 0, and 14
- Node 14: connected to nodes 8, 5, 1, and 13

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

Count of 3-stars = [4]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (7, 3, 8)>
<8, (10, 11, 14)>
<13, (6, 7, 12)>
<14, (1, 5, 13)>
