Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes in each 3-star structure. 

Here are the 3-stars identified in the graph:

<0, (9, 13, 14)>
<1, (6, 13, 14)>
<2, (8, 9, 1)>
<3, (0, 13, 14)>
<4, (11, 1, 10)>
<5, (8, 10, 5)>
<6, (9, 1, 11)>
<7, (8, 12, 7)>
<8, (12, 2, 5)>
<9, (6, 2, 14)>
<10, (0, 14, 5)>
<11, (6, 13, 4)>
<12, (6, 8, 7)>
<13, (9, 8, 3)>
<14, (9, 0, 12)>

There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
