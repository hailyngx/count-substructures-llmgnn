Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 12) (17, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (19, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 5) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Central node: 11; Leaves: 1, 12, 18
2. Central node: 4; Leaves: 9, 8, 0
3. Central node: 8; Leaves: 4, 16, 15
4. Central node: 1; Leaves: 11, 8, 12
5. Central node: 13; Leaves: 12, 14, 7

There are <11, (1, 12, 18)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>, <8, (4, 16, 15)>, <1, (11, 8, 12)>, and <13, (12, 14, 7)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
