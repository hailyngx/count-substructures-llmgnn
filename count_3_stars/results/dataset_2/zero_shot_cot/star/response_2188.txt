Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 3: <5, (9, 4, 3)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 2: <9, (5, 6, 2)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 8: <6, (9, 1, 8)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 1: <4, (5, 7, 1)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 2: <7, (9, 4, 2)>
6. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 3: <1, (6, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
