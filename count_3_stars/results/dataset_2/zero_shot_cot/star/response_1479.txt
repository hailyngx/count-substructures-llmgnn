Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 16) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 19) (2, 1) (2, 12) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (6, 4) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 8) (13, 12) (13, 9) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes with exactly three connections. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the nodes with three connections:
- Node 3: Connected to 15, 14, and 10
- Node 14: Connected to 3, 17, and 1
- Node 12: Connected to 4, 2, and 18
- Node 18: Connected to 12, 9, and 7

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars for each identified center:
- For node 3: <3, (15, 14, 10)>
- For node 14: <14, (3, 17, 1)>
- For node 12: <12, (4, 2, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
