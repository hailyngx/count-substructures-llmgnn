Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 17) (4, 11) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 14) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 8) (7, 5) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 6) (19, 1) (19, 2) (9, 15) (9, 17) (12, 15) (12, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges, forming 3-stars. Then we will count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 16), (3, 6)
- Node 15: (15, 10), (15, 9), (15, 18)
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 10), (1, 19)
- Node 2: (2, 8), (2, 18), (2, 19)
- Node 5: (5, 13), (5, 0), (5, 16)
- Node 10: (10, 15), (10, 1), (10, 8)
- Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 11)
- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 0)
- Node 18: (18, 3), (18, 15), (18, 2)
- Node 17: (17, 18), (17, 16), (17, 0)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<3, (1, 6, 16)>, <3, (15, 6, 18)>, <3, (1, 10, 19)>, <3, (2, 8, 19)>, <3, (5, 0, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
