Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 7, 3, and 5
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 3, and 6
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 6, and 0
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 6
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 3

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[There are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph.]

<0, (7, 3, 5)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 0)>
<8, (4, 7, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
