Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. We can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8 fulfill this condition. Let's analyze each of them to determine the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. For node 0:
   - 3-star: <0, (6, 5, 9)> 

2. For node 1:
   - 3-star: <1, (9, 2, 7)>

3. For node 3:
   - 3-star: <3, (8, 5, 7)>

4. For node 8:
   - 3-star: <8, (3, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
<0, (6, 5, 9)>, <1, (9, 2, 7)>, <3, (8, 5, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 0)>
