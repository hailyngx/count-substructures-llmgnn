Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 17) (6, 18) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 14) (15, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

Node 0: 5, 8, 15
Node 1: 3, 4, 10, 12, 16
Node 2: 3, 5, 7, 18
Node 3: 1, 2, 11, 13, 19
Node 4: 1, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 9
Node 6: 18
Node 7: 2, 7, 16, 17
Node 8: 0, 14
Node 9: 4, 5, 10, 12
Node 10: 1, 9
Node 11: 3, 13, 17
Node 12: 1, 9, 13, 14
Node 13: 3, 11, 12
Node 14: 8, 12, 15
Node 15: 0, 14
Node 16: 1, 7, 19
Node 17: 7, 11, 17, 18
Node 18: 2, 6, 17
Node 19: 3, 16

Next, we identify the 3-stars:
<1, (3, 10, 16)>
<1, (4, 9, 12)>
<1, (10, 12, 16)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 11)>
<3, (11, 13, 19)>
<7, (2, 7, 17)>
<9, (4, 5, 10)>
<9, (5, 9, 12)>
<12, (1, 9, 13)>
<12, (9, 12, 14)>
<13, (3, 11, 12)>
<14, (8, 12, 15)>
<16, (1, 7, 19)>
<18, (2, 17, 18)>

Thus, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
