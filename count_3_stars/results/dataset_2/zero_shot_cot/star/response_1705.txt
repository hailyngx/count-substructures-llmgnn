Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-star graphs. 
The nodes with 3 edges are: 1, 4, 7, and 13.

Next, let's identify all the possible 3-star graphs, where the center node and three leaves are connected by edges. Then we will determine which of these 3-star graphs are unique.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has edges to nodes 8, 11, and 14, forming a 3-star <1, (8, 11, 14)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has edges to nodes 3, 11, and 12, forming a 3-star <4, (3, 11, 12)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has edges to nodes 0, 6, and 14, forming a 3-star <7, (0, 6, 14)>

For node 13:
- Node 13 has edges to nodes 0, 10, and 13, forming a 3-star <13, (0, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4].
