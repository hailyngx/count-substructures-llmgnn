Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 10) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star pattern.

Let's list the 3-star patterns in the given graph:
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 13)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<3, (1, 10, 13)>
<12, (1, 0, 11)>
<0, (4, 7, 12)>
<8, (12, 9, 5)>
<9, (4, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 0, 11)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 8, 14)>
<14, (9, 5, 10)>
<10, (1, 3, 13)>
<13, (7, 3, 0)>
<11, (12, 9, 6)>

As each 3-star pattern is unique, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
