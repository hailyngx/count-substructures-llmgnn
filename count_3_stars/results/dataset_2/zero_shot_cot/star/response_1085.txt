Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we first identify nodes with 3 connections since a 3-star needs a central node with exactly three connections.

Nodes with 3 connections: 0, 5, 7

Next, we look for 3-stars using these nodes:

From node 0:
- Possible 3-star with node 0 as the center and its connected nodes (5, 8, 3)
- Possible 3-star with node 0 as the center and its connected nodes (5, 2, 7)

From node 5:
- Possible 3-star with node 5 as the center and its connected nodes (0, 6, 3)
- Possible 3-star with node 5 as the center and its connected nodes (0, 2, 7)

From node 7:
- Possible 3-star with node 7 as the center and its connected nodes (0, 1, 3)
- Possible 3-star with node 7 as the center and its connected nodes (0, 5, 9)

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6] 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (5, 8, 3)>
<0, (5, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 3)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
