Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 9) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 13) (9, 6) (12, 19) (27, 10) (27, 26) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 28) (26, 13) (26, 27) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 7) (21, 0) (21, 14) (17, 20) (20, 17) (20, 2) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 25) (3, 14) (3, 8) (28, 13) (28, 5) (28, 8) (28, 18) (14, 26) (14, 21) (14, 3) (19, 22) (19, 12) (19, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 10) (11, 19) (24, 23) (24, 15) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 15) (7, 1) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 23) (29, 10) (18, 28) (18, 0) (23, 24) (23, 29) (23, 16) (4, 5) (4, 1) (0, 21) (0, 18) (0, 1) (15, 24) (15, 7) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 16) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 25) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 29) (10, 25) (25, 2) (25, 16) (25, 10) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and they are as follows:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 28)>
<10, (25, 27, 29)>
<13, (1, 9, 26)>
<22, (2, 5, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
