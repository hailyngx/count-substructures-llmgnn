Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (0, 1, 14)>
<3, (1, 5, 10)>
<4, (1, 5, 13)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (3, 12, 13)>
<7, (4, 5, 12)>
<8, (5, 14, 8)>
<9, (0, 10, 11)>
<10, (3, 9, 13)>
<11, (0, 9, 12)>
<12, (6, 13, 7)>
<13, (6, 10, 14)>
<14, (2, 8, 3)>

There are a total of [14] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
