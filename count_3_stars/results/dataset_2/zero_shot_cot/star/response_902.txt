Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 27) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 21) (25, 3) (25, 10) (25, 8) (28, 9) (28, 8) (29, 9) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 20) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 26) (15, 2) (6, 21) (6, 27) (6, 16) (21, 11) (21, 6) (23, 5) (23, 11) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 12) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 26) (12, 2) (12, 24) (22, 4) (22, 14) (8, 25) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 22) (16, 6) (16, 8) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 20) (24, 12) (24, 16) (24, 13) (24, 18) (14, 22) (14, 20) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 16) (20, 14) (18, 24) (18, 27) (18, 13) (27, 9) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 18) (27, 13) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 18) (13, 27) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 10, 15)>
<2, (5, 12, 15)>
<3, (1, 13, 25)>
<4, (0, 22, 24)>
<5, (2, 9, 26)>
<6, (16, 21, 27)>
<7, (2, 14, 20)>
<8, (16, 20, 25)>
<9, (5, 27, 28)>
<10, (1, 11, 25)>
<11, (10, 21, 23)>
<12, (2, 12, 26)>
<13, (3, 18, 27)>
<14, (7, 20, 22)>
<15, (1, 15, 26)>
<16, (6, 13, 16)>
<18, (13, 18, 24)>
<20, (7, 14, 16)>
<21, (6, 11, 21)>
<22, (4, 14, 22)>
<23, (5, 11, 23)>
<24, (12, 18, 24)>
<25, (3, 10, 25)>
<26, (5, 12, 26)>
<27, (6, 9, 18)>
<28, (9, 8, 28)>
<29, (9, 29, 0)>

There are [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
