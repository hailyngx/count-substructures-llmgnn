Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 8) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 18) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 1) (11, 17) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 18) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
   - 3-star 1: <4, (1, 14, 19)>
   - 3-star 2: <1, (4, 8, 11)>
   - 3-star 3: <8, (1, 5, 15)>
   - 3-star 4: <15, (4, 8, 18)>
   - 3-star 5: <18, (6, 16, 19)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found: <4, (1, 14, 19)>, <1, (4, 8, 11)>, <8, (1, 5, 15)>, <15, (4, 8, 18)>, <18, (6, 16, 19)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
