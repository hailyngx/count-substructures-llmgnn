Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 19) (5, 11) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 14) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 15) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

1. Node 0: (1, 16, 13)
2. Node 1: (0, 10, 2)
3. Node 2: (1, 6, 14)
4. Node 3: (16, 4, 19)
5. Node 4: (8, 15, 3)
6. Node 5: (11, - , -) (not a 3-star)
7. Node 6: (10, 2, -)
8. Node 7: (18, 2, -)
9. Node 8: (4, 18, -)
10. Node 9: (11, 17, 16)
11. Node 10: (1, 6, 17)
12. Node 11: (13, 5, 9)
13. Node 12: (19, - , -) (not a 3-star)
14. Node 13: (0, 11, 17)
15. Node 14: (2, 18, 15)
16. Node 15: (4, 14, -)
17. Node 16: (17, 3, 9)
18. Node 17: (10, 13, 16)
19. Node 18: (8, 7, 14)
20. Node 19: (17, 11, 3)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are 17 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
