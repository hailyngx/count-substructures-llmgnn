Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes connected to each node. 

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 3, 2, and 4.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, and 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 1, and 4.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 0.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 1, 2, and 0.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 7, and 3.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 1, and 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 2, 7.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 2, 3, and 7.

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

1. <5, (9, 2, 8)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 7)>
3. <6, (9, 1, 7)>
4. <1, (5, 3, 2)>
5. <3, (9, 6, 4)>
6. <4, (1, 3, 0)>
7. <0, (5, 4, -)>
8. <8, (5, 2, 7)>
9. <2, (5, 9, 1)>
10. <7, (9, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
