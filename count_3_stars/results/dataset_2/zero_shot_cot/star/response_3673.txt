Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (10, 7) (17, 12) (17, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 12) (4, 13) (4, 18) (0, 9) (0, 6) (14, 9) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 1) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique combinations of central nodes and leaf nodes. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all possible combinations that satisfy this condition.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:
<11, (16, 19, 13)>
<16, (11, 15, 18)>
<5, (19, 12, 3)>
<3, (16, 5, 1)>
<18, (16, 2, 4)>
<9, (15, 14, 0)>
<1, (3, 2, 19)>
<8, (2, 7, 8)>
<13, (11, 4, 13)>
<10, (7, 10, 10)>
<17, (12, 15, 17)>
<14, (9, 14, 9)>
<0, (9, 6, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
