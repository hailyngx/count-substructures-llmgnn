Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 24) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 28) (7, 24) (21, 3) (21, 20) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 23) (15, 21) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (20, 21) (20, 5) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 5) (26, 8) (26, 22) (9, 16) (9, 12) (11, 23) (11, 15) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 17) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 4) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 17) (28, 3) (28, 23) (28, 0) (28, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 6) (29, 10) (2, 27) (2, 17) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 19) (10, 29) (10, 4) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 25) (17, 22) (17, 11) (17, 27) (17, 2) (4, 0) (4, 25) (4, 10) (4, 6) (5, 20) (5, 14) (5, 28) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to node 1:
(1, 3), (1, 16), (1, 8), (1, 8) -> Connected to nodes 3, 16, 8

Step 2: Find the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center:
<1, (3, 16, 8)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
