Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can see that nodes 4, 7, and 5 each have degree 4, which means they are potential centers of 3-stars. Let's check each of them:

1. Potential 3-star centered at node 4:
   - (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 5)
   - This forms the 3-star <4, (7, 0, 3)>

2. Potential 3-star centered at node 7:
   - (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 5)
   - This forms the 3-star <7, (4, 6, 9)>

3. Potential 3-star centered at node 5:
   - (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 1)
   - This forms the 3-star <5, (4, 7, 6)>

There are no other potential 3-star centers in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <4, (7, 0, 3)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, and <5, (4, 7, 6)>.
