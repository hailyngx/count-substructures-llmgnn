Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are the central nodes in the 3-stars. These nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming the arms of the stars. 
Looking at the edges, we can identify the following central nodes: 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 4, 0, 10, 12, 13.

Next, we will find the leaves for each central node and see if they are connected to each other through the central node. 

For node 5:
- Leaves: 9, 6, 8, 12, 11
  <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 12)>, <5, (9, 6, 11)>, <5, (6, 8, 12)>, <5, (6, 8, 11)>, <5, (8, 12, 11)>
  
For node 9:
- Leaves: 5, 6, 4, 3, 13, 0
  <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 13)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 13)>, <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 13)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (5, 13, 0)>, <9, (6, 4, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 13)>, <9, (6, 4, 0)>, <9, (6, 3, 13)>, <9, (6, 3, 0)>, <9, (6, 13, 0)>, <9, (4, 3, 13)>, <9, (4, 3, 0)>, <9, (4, 13, 0)>, <9, (3, 13, 0)>

...repeating the process for each central node. 

Counting all unique 3-stars, we get:
