Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 13) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 0) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 2) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 7) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the graph with 20 nodes, we can start by looking for possible 3-star configurations.

After analyzing the edges provided in the graph, we identify the following unique 3-star configurations:
<3, (13, 15, 19)>
<4, (5, 10, 18)>
<5, (9, 11, 19)>
<7, (1, 8, 14)>
<9, (0, 5, 17)>
<12, (2, 3, 4)>
<13, (2, 3, 16)>
<15, (2, 3, 19)>
<16, (11, 13, 17)>
<17, (16, 17, 18)>
<18, (4, 17, 18)>
<19, (0, 5, 15)>

Counting the total unique 3-stars, we find there are 12 unique configurations. Thus, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [12].
