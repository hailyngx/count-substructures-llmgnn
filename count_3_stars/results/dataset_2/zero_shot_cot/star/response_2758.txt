Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (7, 2, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are 6 3-star graphs in total.
