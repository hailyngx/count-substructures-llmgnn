Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 16) (10, 15) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 12) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 19) (1, 4) (1, 9) (13, 9) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 5) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 4) (6, 19) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <0, (17, 4, 14)>
2. <2, (9, 14, 18)>
3. <3, (8, 11, 15)>
4. <5, (8, 11, 16)>
5. <6, (4, 12, 19)>
6. <7, (0, 11, 14)>
7. <9, (1, 9, 13)>
8. <10, (15, 17, 0)>
9. <12, (8, 11, 19)>
10. <16, (7, 15, 5)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph.
