Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are directly connected to the other three nodes. These nodes will act as the center of a 3-star. 
Using the given edges, the nodes 10, 11, 7, and 14 are directly connected to three other nodes each. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each center node:
- Node 10: (10, 11, 14), (10, 4, 10), (10, 14, 8) [3 3-stars]
- Node 11: (11, 10, 14), (11, 13, 11), (11, 6, 13) [3 3-stars]
- Node 7: (7, 3, 6), (7, 5, 2), (7, 13, 11) [3 3-stars]
- Node 14: (14, 10, 11), (14, 13, 9), (14, 8, 14) [3 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<10, (11, 14, 13)>
<10, (4, 10, 14)>
<10, (14, 8, 3)>
<11, (10, 14, 3)>
<11, (13, 11, 6)>
<11, (6, 13, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 13)>
<7, (5, 2, 14)>
<7, (13, 11, 6)>
<14, (10, 11, 13)>
<14, (13, 9, 7)>
<14, (8, 14, 10)>
