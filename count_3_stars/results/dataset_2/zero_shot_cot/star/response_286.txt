Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. <4, (7, 9, 1)>
2. <7, (4, 5, 9)>
3. <6, (9, 5, 1)>
4. <9, (4, 7, 6)>
5. <8, (6, 2, 9)>
6. <5, (7, 6, 1)>
7. <2, (9, 8, 3)>
8. <0, (8, 5, 3)>
9. <1, (4, 6, 5)>
10. <3, (4, 8, 2)>

So, there are 10 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
