Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 12) (17, 22) (2, 1) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 28) (22, 17) (22, 23) (22, 11) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 16) (23, 9) (10, 0) (10, 9) (4, 23) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 12) (28, 14) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 15) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 20) (18, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 26) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 25) (20, 8) (20, 18) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 15) (26, 12) (26, 24) (26, 11) (26, 3) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 16) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 6) (9, 23) (9, 10) (9, 13) (25, 0) (25, 21) (27, 11) (27, 1) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 19) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 24) (1, 27) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 27) (11, 6) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 24) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (19, 12) (19, 3) (21, 18) (21, 5) (21, 25) (16, 23) (16, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of our 3-stars.

Based on the given edges, the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them are: 13, 3, 16, and 4. So, these will be the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph.

Next, we identify the nodes connected to each central node to complete the 3-stars.

For central node 13:
- (13, 28), (13, 5), and (13, 9)

For central node 3:
- (3, 26), (3, 6), and (3, 19)

For central node 16:
- (16, 23), (16, 5), and (16, 9)

For central node 4:
- (4, 23), (4, 8), and (4, 8)

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:
<13, (28, 5, 9)>
<3, (26, 6, 19)>
<16, (23, 5, 9)>
<4, (23, 8, 8)>

There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
