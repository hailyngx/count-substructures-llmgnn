Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. We will look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The central nodes in this graph are: 
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 9, 5, and 4)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 6, 4, and 7)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 6, 9, and 1)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 6, 9, and 3)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 9, 3, and 8)

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars with these central nodes. 

Counting the number of 3-stars:
- Total number of 3-stars with central node 6: 3
- Total number of 3-stars with central node 9: 3
- Total number of 3-stars with central node 4: 3
- Total number of 3-stars with central node 0: 3
- Total number of 3-stars with central node 7: 3

Adding all the 3-stars together, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15]. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
<6, (9, 5, 4)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (6, 9, 1)>
<0, (6, 9, 3)>
<7, (9, 3, 8)>
