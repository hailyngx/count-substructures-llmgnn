Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central node connected to three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. For node 6: <6, (9, 8, 4)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>
2. For node 9: <9, (6, 1, 0)>
3. For node 1: <1, (9, 3, 5)>, <1, (9, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>
4. For node 3: <3, (1, 7, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>
5. For node 4: <4, (6, 7, 5)>, <4, (6, 5, 2)>
6. For node 7: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 4, 0)>
7. For node 0: <0, (6, 9, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 5)>, <0, (9, 1, 7)>, <0, (9, 7, 5)>, <0, (7, 1, 4)>
8. For node 2: <2, (4, 8, 5)>
9. For node 8: <8, (6, 3, 0)>, <8, (6, 0, 2)>, <8, (3, 0, 2)>, <8, (3, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 2, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 6)>
10. For node 5: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <5, (3, 1, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 0)>, <5, (0, 6, 8)>, <5, (0, 8, 2)>

Hence, there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
