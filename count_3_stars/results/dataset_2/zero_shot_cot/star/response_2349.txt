Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 6) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 2) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, identify all 3-stars in the graph. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<4, (13, 5, 11)>
<10, (11, 12, 8)>
<11, (10, 14, 0)>
<14, (7, 11, 3)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (14, 6, 8)>
<6, (14, 2, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 10)>
<3, (4, 14, 6)>
<0, (11, 2, 9)>
<7, (14, 5, 10)>
<12, (10, 3, 13)>
<13, (4, 2, 6)>

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [13].
