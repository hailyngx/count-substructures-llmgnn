Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 0) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 4) (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 12) (22, 21) (6, 13) (6, 25) (6, 0) (9, 2) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 1) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 24) (1, 18) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 29) (21, 16) (21, 22) (21, 12) (4, 16) (4, 27) (4, 5) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 17) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 8) (29, 1) (29, 12) (28, 27) (28, 23) (28, 15) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 15) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 5) (15, 10) (15, 28) (15, 14) (15, 26) (23, 28) (23, 26) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 3) (7, 27) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 27) (20, 3) (20, 24) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 3) (19, 2) (12, 22) (12, 21) (12, 29) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 20) (3, 2) (25, 6) (25, 24) (24, 13) (24, 10) (24, 20) (24, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look for nodes that are connected exactly to three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. In this case, nodes 1, 6, and 13 fit this criteria.

2. For each of these center nodes, identify the adjacent nodes connected to them. These will be the leaves of the 3-stars. Count all possible 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph: 
<1, (10, 18, 29)>
<6, (13, 0, 25)>
<13, (22, 24, 14)>

Count of 3-stars: [3]
