Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (2, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 19) (14, 13) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 9) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 5) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's determine the degree of each node by counting how many edges are incident to it:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 4

Now, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (7, 17, 6)>
<7, (3, 17, 18)>
<15, (8, 19, 5)>
<4, (1, 17, 8)>
<10, (17, 6, 9)>
<16, (3, 10, 2)>
<5, (11, 15, 12)>
<12, (17, 18, 11)>
<6, (3, 10, 11)>
<13, (15, 0, 14)>

Since we have 10 unique 3-stars in the graph, the answer is [10].
