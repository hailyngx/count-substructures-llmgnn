Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

The central nodes in this case are 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 9, 8, 2, 5, and 0.

For each central node:
1. Central node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, 0, and 5.
2. Central node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 2.
3. Central node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
4. Central node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 6, 9, and 5.
5. Central node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 9, and 8.
6. Central node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, and 8.
7. Central node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 6, 9, and 5.
8. Central node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 0.
9. Central node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 8, and 0.
10. Central node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 2, and 5.

Based on the connections, the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 6)>
<2, (7, 0,)>
<5, (4, 3, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 2)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
