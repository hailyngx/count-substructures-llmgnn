Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (15, 24) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 26) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 28) (7, 23) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 28) (22, 2) (3, 24) (3, 16) (12, 15) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 26) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (21, 15) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 25) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 20) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 25) (10, 21) (10, 13) (8, 14) (8, 1) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 29) (16, 18) (16, 3) (16, 21) (17, 0) (17, 23) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 9) (2, 22) (2, 14) (2, 11) (6, 12) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 1) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 5) (23, 29) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 23) (20, 7) (20, 28) (20, 24) (24, 15) (24, 3) (24, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 15 has edges to 27, 12, 24, and 21 (4 edges).
- Node 27 has edges to 15, 12, 26 (3 edges).
- Node 4 has edges to 7, 18, 25 (3 edges).
- Node 7 has edges to 4, 20, 28, 23 (4 edges).
- Node 18 has edges to 4, 14, 16, 28 (4 edges).
- Node 21 has edges to 15, 28, 10, 16, 25 (5 edges).
- Node 28 has edges to 7, 18, 21, 20 (4 edges).
- Node 13 has edges to 1, 10, 19 (3 edges).
- Node 19 has edges to 13, 11, 29 (3 edges).
- Node 11 has edges to 19, 2, 1 (3 edges).
- Node 29 has edges to 19, 5, 23 (3 edges).
- Node 20 has edges to 7, 28, 24 (3 edges).
- Node 24 has edges to 15, 3, 20 (3 edges).

2. From the above analysis, we can see that the unique 3-stars are:
- <15, (27, 12, 24)>
- <27, (15, 12, 26)>
- <4, (7, 18, 25)>
- <7, (4, 20, 28)>
- <18, (4, 14, 16)>
- <21, (15, 28, 10)>
- <28, (7, 18, 21)>
- <13, (1, 10, 19)>
- <19, (13, 11, 29)>
- <11, (19, 2, 1)>
- <29, (19, 5, 23)>
- <20, (7, 28, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
