Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 2)>
<1, (7, 11, 12)>
<2, (10, 13, 0)>
<3, (5, 4, 14)>
<4, (5, 13, 10)>
<5, (6, 13, 8)>
<6, (5, 10, 0)>
<7, (0, 8, 1)>
<8, (5, 7, 14)>
<9, (14, 6, 10)>
<10, (6, 4, 11)>
<11, (7, 1, 8)>
<12, (4, 1, 7)>
<13, (10, 2, 3)>
<14, (9, 3, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
