Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's identify those nodes first.

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 6, 8, and 4
- Node 3 has edges to nodes 5, 1, and 7
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 5, 3, and 2
- Node 4 has edges to nodes 5, 0, and 2
- Node 0 has edges to nodes 6, 1, and 4
- Node 7 has edges to nodes 5, 1, and 3

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<8, (5, 3, 2)>
<4, (5, 0, 2)>
<0, (6, 1, 4)>
<7, (5, 1, 3)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
