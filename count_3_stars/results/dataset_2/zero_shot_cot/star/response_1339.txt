Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) 

Response:
There are 8 3-stars in the given graph.
