Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 neighbors connected to it. 

Let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 2)
- Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 3)
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6)
- Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 0)
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 2)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 1)
- Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7)
- Node 8: (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 3)
- Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 1)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<1, (9, 6, 0)>
<3, (4, 7, 2)>
<6, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<8, (7, 1, 3)>
<0, (5, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
