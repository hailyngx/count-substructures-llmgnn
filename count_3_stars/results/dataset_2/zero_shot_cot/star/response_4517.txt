Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (13, 14, 11)>
<1, (9, 2, 7)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (8, 13, 12)>
<4, (13, 14, 0)>
<5, (9, 8, 14)>
<6, (13, 7, 12)>
<7, (14, 4, 1)>
<8, (5, 13, 3)>
<9, (5, 10, 1)>
<10, (9, 8, 12)>
<11, (0, 7, 1)>
<12, (13, 10, 7)>
<13, (8, 6, 0)>
<14, (5, 0, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
