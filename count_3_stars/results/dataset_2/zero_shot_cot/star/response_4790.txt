Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
Firstly, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: connected to 3, 6, 13, 14
- Node 1: connected to 2, 10, 12, 13
- Node 2: connected to 1, 3, 5, 7, 13
- Node 3: connected to 0, 2, 11
- Node 4: connected to 6, 10, 12
- Node 5: connected to 2, 7, 8
- Node 6: connected to 0, 4, 14
- Node 7: connected to 2, 5, 10, 13, 14
- Node 8: connected to 5, 7, 9, 10
- Node 9: connected to 8, 11, 12
- Node 10: connected to 1, 4, 7, 8, 11
- Node 11: connected to 3, 9, 10, 12
- Node 12: connected to 1, 4, 9, 11, 14
- Node 13: connected to 0, 1, 2, 7, 14
- Node 14: connected to 0, 6, 7, 12, 13

From the above information, we can see that there are:
- 3-stars with central node 0: <0, (3, 6, 13)> and <0, (6, 13, 14)> (2 3-stars)
- 3-stars with central node 1: <1, (2, 10, 12)> (1 3-star)
- 3-stars with central node 2: <2, (1, 5, 7)> (1 3-star)
- 3-stars with central node 3: No 3-stars
- 3-stars with central node 4: No 3-stars
- 3-stars with central node 5: No 3-stars
- 3-stars with central node 6: <6, (0, 4, 14)> (1 3-star)
- 3-stars with central node 7: <7, (2, 5, 13)> (1 3-star)
- 3-stars with central node 8: No 3-stars
- 3-stars with central node 9: No 3-stars
- 3-stars with central node 10: No 3-stars
- 3-stars with central node 11: No 3-stars
- 3-stars with central node 12: No 3-stars
- 3-stars with central node 13: No 3-stars
- 3-stars with central node 14: No 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 13)>, <0, (6, 13, 14)>, <1, (2, 10, 12)>, and <6, (0, 4, 14)>.
