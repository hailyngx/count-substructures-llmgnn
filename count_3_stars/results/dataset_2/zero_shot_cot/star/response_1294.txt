Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 27) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 22) (27, 18) (27, 19) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 29) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 12) (25, 18) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 20) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 1) (28, 29) (28, 18) (28, 5) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 28) (26, 10) (26, 7) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 8) (21, 6) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 12) (12, 25) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 5) (5, 28) (5, 12) (18, 27) (18, 25) (18, 28) (19, 13) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 27) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 3) (17, 6) (7, 26) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 20) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 7) (20, 23) (20, 7) (24, 8) (24, 0) (0, 24) (1, 23) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 9) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (10, 9, 23)>
<2, (15, 11, 19)>
<3, (25, 10, 17)>
<4, (12, 5, 16)>
<5, (28, 12, 18)>
<6, (21, 17, 7)>
<7, (26, 16, 20)>
<8, (24, 0, 1)>
<9, (1, 10, 25)>
<10, (15, 3, 26)>
<11, (14, 2, 8)>
<12, (5, 28, 25)>
<13, (16, 19, 22)>
<14, (7, 11, 14)>
<15, (19, 2, 15)>
<16, (12, 4, 7)>
<17, (6, 3, 21)>
<18, (5, 28, 25)>
<19, (13, 22, 27)>
<20, (7, 16, 23)>
<21, (6, 8, 17)>
<22, (19, 13, 27)>
<23, (20, 1, 8)>
<24, (0, 8, 24)>
<25, (12, 3, 18)>
<26, (10, 7, 27)>
<27, (22, 19, 26)>
<28, (5, 18, 29)>
<29, (3, 25, 28)>
<0, (8, 24, 0)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [30]
