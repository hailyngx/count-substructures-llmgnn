Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 6) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 6) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 10) (4, 1) (18, 4) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 4) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 16) (7, 10) (7, 13) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 19) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 5) (5, 8) (5, 17) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 13) (13, 16) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<11, (16, 3, 1)>
<16, (11, 12, 13)>
<0, (12, 19, 6)>
<14, (6, )>
<2, (12, 19, )>
<8, (5, 10, 15)>
<4, (11, 18, 10)>
<18, (4, 3, )>
<3, (11, 18, 17)>
<1, (11, 8, 4)>
<15, (8, 10, )>
<10, (8, 4, 15)>
<12, (16, 0, 2)>
<9, (16, )>
<7, (10, 13, )>
<6, (16, 14, 12)>
<17, (3, 6, 5)>
<5, (8, 17, )>
<19, (0, 2, 6)>
<13, (16, 7, 19)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
