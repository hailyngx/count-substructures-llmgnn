Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 10) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) (5, 6) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (15, 13) (15, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 2) (10, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (12, 9) (12, 14) (0, 18) (0, 6) (0, 9) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 14) (13, 15) (13, 19) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 19) 

Response:
We start by listing all the nodes that are connected to others (i.e., not isolated nodes) based on the given edges.

Connected nodes:
2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Next, we identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., potential centers of 3-stars):

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 4, 15, 9, 0, 16, 11, 14, 19, 3, 7, 13

Now, we find the 3-stars. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. We identify the unique 3-stars:

<2, (4, 8, 10)>
<5, (6, 7, 16)>
<6, (0, 10, 16)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 11, 12)>
<10, (2, 6, 16)>
<4, (2, 15, 5)>
<15, (4, 13, 16)>
<0, (6, 9, 18)>
<16, (3, 5, 6)>
<11, (1, 14, 9)>
<14, (3, 11, 12)>
<19, (7, 13, 17)>
<3, (8, 14, 16)>
<7, (5, 18, 19)>
<13, (15, 19, 17)>

Finally, we count the number of unique 3-stars, which is represented as [16].
