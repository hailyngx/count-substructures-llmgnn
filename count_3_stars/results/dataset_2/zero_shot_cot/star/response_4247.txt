Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 19) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 16) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 4) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars by checking if there is a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
After analyzing the provided edges, we find the following <center, leaves> pairs that form 3-stars:
<3, (0, 11, 13)>
<4, (1, 12, 16)>
<7, (2, 6, 10)>
<9, (1, 5, 12)>
<10, (7, 14, 18)>
<12, (3, 4, 6)>
<13, (0, 2, 5)>
<16, (4, 7, 18)>
<18, (10, 11, 16)>
<19, (2, 3, 8)>
Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
