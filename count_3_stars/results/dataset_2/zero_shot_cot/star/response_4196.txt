Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph. 

We will list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (11, 7, 4)>
<1, (3, 14, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 0)>
<4, (10, 0, 5)>
<5, (14, 2, 4)>
<6, (10, 0, 12)>
<7, (8, 13, 0)>
<8, (10, 11, 13)>
<9, (10, 1, 14)>
<10, (11, 6, 4)>
<11, (8, 10, 0)>
<12, (8, 4, 6)>
<13, (8, 7, 0)>
<14, (1, 0, 5)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: 

[14]
