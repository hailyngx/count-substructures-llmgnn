Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 19) (1, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 9) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 10) (11, 15) (11, 0) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 10) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. We are looking for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes, indicating that they are the center of a 3-star.

The nodes that form 3-stars are: 2, 12, 8, 10, 5, 18, 14, 4, 17, and 7. 

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. To do this, we will go through each of the identified nodes and determine the connected nodes.

For node 2:
- Connected nodes: 18, 5, 13, 6, 7
<2, (18, 5, 13)>

For node 12:
- Connected nodes: 14, 7, 16, 8
<12, (14, 7, 16)>

For node 8:
- Connected nodes: 17, 1, 12, 19
<8, (17, 1, 19)>

For node 10:
- Connected nodes: 3, 6, 9, 4, 13
<10, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 5:
- Connected nodes: 2, 0, 4
<5, (2, 0, 4)>

For node 18:
- Connected nodes: 17, 2, 9, 6
<18, (17, 2, 9)>

For node 14:
- Connected nodes: 17, 9, 12, 4
<14, (17, 9, 4)>

For node 4:
- Connected nodes: 15, 14, 5, 10
<4, (15, 14, 5)>

For node 17:
- Connected nodes: 14, 8, 18
<17, (14, 8, 18)>

For node 7:
- Connected nodes: 2, 12
<7, (2, 12, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
