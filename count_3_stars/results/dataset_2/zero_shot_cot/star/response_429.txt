Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 11) (9, 12) (26, 19) (26, 23) (3, 16) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 2) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 17) (0, 25) (20, 1) (20, 8) (2, 15) (2, 24) (8, 20) (8, 25) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 24) (19, 6) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (23, 26) (23, 15) (1, 20) (1, 13) (6, 19) (6, 22) (4, 11) (4, 22) (4, 5) (22, 6) (22, 4) (12, 9) (12, 16) (12, 28) (12, 18) (16, 3) (16, 29) (16, 12) (16, 27) (25, 9) (25, 0) (25, 8) (27, 29) (27, 16) (27, 21) (27, 17) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 19) (24, 28) (14, 18) (14, 7) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 24) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 5) (21, 19) (21, 27) (21, 17) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 13) (13, 1) (13, 18) (17, 15) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 21) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (10, 29) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Let's begin by listing all the nodes that form 3-stars. 
1. Node 9 is connected to nodes 29, 25, 11, and 12.
2. Node 26 is connected to nodes 19, 23.
3. Node 29 is connected to nodes 9, 27, 16, 10.
4. Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 4.
5. Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 16, 28, 18.
6. Node 16 is connected to nodes 3, 29, 12, 27.
7. Node 25 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 8.
8. Node 1 is connected to nodes 20, 13.
9. Node 6 is connected to nodes 19, 22.
10. Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 22, 5.
11. Node 22 is connected to nodes 6, 4.
12. Node 28 is connected to nodes 0, 19, 12, 24.
13. Node 18 is connected to nodes 12, 14, 13.
14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 18.
15. Node 17 is connected to nodes 15, 0, 27, 21.
16. Node 7 is connected to nodes 14, 10, 5.
17. Node 21 is connected to nodes 19, 27, 17.
18. Node 10 is connected to nodes 29, 7, 5.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[<9, (29, 25, 11)>, <9, (29, 25, 12)>, <9, (25, 0, 8)>, <26, (19, 23, 15)>, <29, (9, 27, 16)>, <29, (9, 16, 10)>, <11, (9, 5, 4)>, <12, (9, 16, 28)>, <12, (16, 3, 27)>, <12, (16, 27, 28)>, <16, (3, 27, 21)>, <16, (27, 21, 17)>, <25, (9, 0, 8)>, <1, (20, 13, 18)>, <6, (19, 22, 4)>, <22, (6, 4, 5)>, <28, (0, 19, 24)>, <28, (19, 24, 12)>, <18, (12, 14, 13)>, <17, (15, 0, 27)>, <17, (0, 27, 21)>, <7, (14, 10, 5)>, <21, (19, 27, 17)>]
