Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. 
Given that a 3-star structure has a central node connected to exactly three leaves, we can identify the potential central nodes by checking for nodes with degree 3 in the graph.

From the provided list of edges, we can identify the degrees of each node to find potential central nodes:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 6
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 3

The potential central nodes are Node 1 and Node 9 as they have a degree of 3.

Now, we can check the neighbors of these potential central nodes to see if they form 3-stars. 

For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to Node 6, Node 3, and Node 4.
- Node 6, Node 3, and Node 4 are not connected directly (no 3-star).

For Node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to Node 8, Node 4, and Node 7.
- Node 8, Node 4, and Node 7 are directly connected (form a 3-star).

Therefore, there is 1 unique 3-star in the given graph: <9, (8, 4, 7)>.

Finally, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
