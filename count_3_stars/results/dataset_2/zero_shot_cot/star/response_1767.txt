Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 11) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are <6, (9, 14, 3)> and <9, (6, 11, 10)> as 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
