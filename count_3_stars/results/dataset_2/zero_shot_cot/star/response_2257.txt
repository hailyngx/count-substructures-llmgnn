Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 14) (21, 23) (28, 12) (28, 18) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 4) (9, 22) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 24) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 1) (27, 4) (27, 25) (8, 15) (8, 10) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 27) (25, 19) (25, 29) (19, 22) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 12) (10, 26) (10, 8) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 6) (16, 24) (16, 6) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 29) (2, 23) (14, 20) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 23) (7, 20) (7, 22) (7, 1) (0, 11) (0, 29) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 28) (18, 24) (18, 6) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 18) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 26) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 29) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 0) (29, 23) (29, 3) (5, 3) 

Response:
The steps to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 15 has 4 edges
- Node 17 has 4 edges
- Node 20 has 3 edges
- Node 22 has 5 edges
- Node 26 has 4 edges
- Node 1 has 4 edges
- Node 4 has 2 edges
- Node 27 has 3 edges
- Node 8 has 2 edges
- Node 25 has 5 edges
- Node 19 has 4 edges
- Node 10 has 2 edges
- Node 12 has 4 edges
- Node 16 has 2 edges
- Node 24 has 4 edges
- Node 14 has 4 edges
- Node 6 has 3 edges

2. Clearly, there are multiple nodes with more than 3 edges, but for each such node, we only focus on the 3-star configurations. Therefore, only nodes 15, 17, 22, 25, and 29 allow for 3-star configurations.

3. Count the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- For node 15:
  - Number of 3-stars = 0

- For node 17:
  - Number of 3-stars = 1 (<17, (15, 25, 24)>)

- For node 22:
  - Number of 3-stars = 2 (<22, (26, 19, 14)>, <22, (19, 25, 14)>)

- For node 25:
  - Number of 3-stars = 1 (<25, (15, 17, 27)>)

- For node 29:
  - Number of 3-stars = 2 (<29, (25, 24, 23)>, <29, (0, 23, 3)>)

4. Summing up the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
\[0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6\]

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
