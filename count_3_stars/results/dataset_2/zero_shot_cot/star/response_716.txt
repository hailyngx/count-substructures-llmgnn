Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 1) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 10) (15, 19) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 5) (11, 2) (11, 6) (11, 0) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 3) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 16) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 3) (13, 1) (16, 10) (16, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which can serve as potential centers of 3-stars. We will exclude nodes that have fewer or more connections as they cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Let's list all potential 3-star centers:
[4, 7, 10, 15, 19, 6, 9]

Next, we will check for each potential center how many 3-stars can be formed. 
Starting with node 4:
- (4, 7, 9)
- (4, 7, 17)

Next, checking node 7:
- (7, 4, 12)
- (7, 10, 19)

Checking node 10:
- (10, 7, 15)
- (10, 7, 19)

Checking node 15:
- (15, 10, 19)

Checking node 19:
- (19, 7, 10)
- (19, 7, 14)

Checking node 6:
- (6, 1, 14)

Checking node 9:
- (9, 4, 17)

Total number of 3-stars found: 10
Therefore, the answer is [10].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<7, (4, 12, 10)>
<7, (10, 19, 15)>
<15, (10, 19, 7)>
<19, (7, 14, 10)>
<6, (1, 14, 6)>
<9, (4, 17, 9)>
