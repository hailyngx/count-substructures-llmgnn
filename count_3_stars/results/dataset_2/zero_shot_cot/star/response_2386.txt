Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star. 

The nodes with exactly three edges are:
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 9, 1, 7)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 6, 9, 2)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 9, 8, 0)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 4, 2, 7)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 4)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 4, 8)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 6, 9, 8)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 3, 4, 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[A total of 5 3-stars were found in the graph.]

<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<1, (6, 9, 2)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (4, 2, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
