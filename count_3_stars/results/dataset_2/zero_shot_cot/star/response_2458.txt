Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 25) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 5) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 19) (10, 23) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 22) (28, 1) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 14) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 1) (7, 25) (7, 1) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 22) (22, 26) (22, 17) (22, 12) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 21) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 27) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 18) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 17) (19, 13) (0, 11) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 18) (16, 14) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 14) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 15) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 8) (1, 7) (13, 3) (13, 19) (24, 15) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 24) (27, 6) (23, 10) (23, 17) (23, 14) (14, 29) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 23) (5, 20) (5, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

- Node 9 is connected to nodes 26, 18, 25.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 9, 22, 20.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 26, 17, 5.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 9, 26, 7.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 20, 23, 19.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 26, 17, 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 22.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 22, 11, 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 0, 21.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 11, 6, 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 19, 3,  . 

There are 11 unique 3-stars in this graph:

<9, (26, 18, 25)>
<26, (9, 22, 20)>
<20, (26, 17, 5)>
<25, (9, 26, 7)>
<17, (20, 23, 19)>
<22, (26, 17, 12)>
<12, (2, 4, 22)>
<3, (22, 11, 13)>
<11, (3, 0, 21)>
<21, (11, 6, 18)>
<13, (19, 3,  ). 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
