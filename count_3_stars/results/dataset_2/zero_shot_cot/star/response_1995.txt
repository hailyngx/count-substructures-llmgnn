Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 2) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 14) 

Response:
The nodes forming a 3-star in this graph must follow the pattern: center node connected to three leaves. 
Let's count the number of 3-stars by identifying the unique combinations:

<1, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 12)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 11)>
<7, (5, 11, 14)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 7, 14)>
<10, (0, 11, 14)>
<11, (6, 7, 10)>
<12, (0, 4, 13)>
<13, (2, 6, 12)>
<14, (7, 9, 10)>

Therefore, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
