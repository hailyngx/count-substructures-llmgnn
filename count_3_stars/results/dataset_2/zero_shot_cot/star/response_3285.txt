Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (14, 11) (14, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star structure, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: (6, 0), (9, 0), (13, 0), (3, 0)
- Node 1: (9, 1), (13, 1), (10, 1), (2, 1), (12, 1)
- Node 2: (10, 2), (5, 2), (3, 2), (12, 2), (1, 2), (7, 2)
- Node 3: (8, 3), (11, 3), (3, 0), (2, 3), (7, 3)
- Node 4: (6, 4), (10, 4), (5, 4)
- Node 5: (11, 5), (5, 4), (5, 2)
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 0), (6, 13), (4, 6)
- Node 7: (8, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (7, 14)
- Node 8: (8, 13), (8, 7), (7, 8)
- Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 0), (9, 12), (12, 9)
- Node 10: (10, 1), (10, 4), (10, 2)
- Node 11: (13, 11), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 5), (11, 12), (5, 11), (14, 11)
- Node 12: (12, 9), (12, 11), (12, 2), (12, 1)
- Node 13: (6, 13), (8, 13), (13, 11), (13, 1), (13, 0)
- Node 14: (11, 14), (14, 7)

2. From the connections above, we can identify the 3-star structures as follows:
- <0, (6, 9, 13)>
- <1, (9, 10, 12)>
- <2, (10, 3, 7)>
- <3, (8, 11, 7)>
- <4, (6, 5, 10)>
- <5, (11, 4, 2)>
- <6, (0, 9, 4)>
- <7, (8, 3, 14)>
- <8, (8, 13, 7)>
- <9, (9, 6, 12)>
- <10, (10, 2, 4)>
- <11, (13, 11, 5)>
- <12, (12, 2, 1)>
- <13, (13, 8, 1)>
- <14, (14, 11, 7)>

3. Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
