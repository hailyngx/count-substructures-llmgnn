Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 8)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<8, (9, 1, 4)>
