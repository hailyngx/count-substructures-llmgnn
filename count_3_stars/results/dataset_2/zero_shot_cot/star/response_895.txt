Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors forming a 3-star configuration.

After examining the provided edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 1)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
