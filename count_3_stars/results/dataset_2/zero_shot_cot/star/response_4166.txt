Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star combinations in the given graph:
1. <0, (4, 8, 3)>
2. <1, (5, 7, 0)>
3. <2, (5, 7, 0)>
4. <3, (9, 4, 8)>
5. <4, (9, 7, 0)>
6. <5, (9, 2, 1)>
7. <6, (9, 4, 8)>
8. <7, (9, 4, 1)>
9. <8, (4, 3, 6)>
10. <9, (5, 6, 3)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
