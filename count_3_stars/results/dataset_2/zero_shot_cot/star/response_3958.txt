Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 9) (15, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (17, 13) (17, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 16) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 6) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 16) (14, 12) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 9, and 2. <3, (10, 9, 2)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 0. <4, (9, 13, 0)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 12. <8, (11, 6, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
