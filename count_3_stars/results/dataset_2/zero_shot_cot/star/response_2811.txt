Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 24) (14, 15) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 9) (27, 25) (27, 5) (2, 18) (2, 23) (2, 24) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 29) (1, 12) (26, 8) (26, 4) (5, 27) (6, 7) (6, 22) (4, 18) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 25) (4, 29) (8, 26) (8, 4) (8, 24) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 25) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 13) (29, 0) (29, 18) (29, 4) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 20) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 13) (3, 10) (3, 21) (3, 12) (21, 3) (21, 24) (22, 6) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 20) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (25, 19) (20, 16) (20, 22) (24, 14) (24, 0) (24, 2) (24, 8) (24, 21) (7, 6) (7, 28) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 23) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 12) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 25) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 15) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step:
1. The total number of nodes is 30, and the total number of edges is 90.
2. Given the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for a central node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. We will identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<14, (17, 15, 16)>
<17, (14, 9, 19)>
<0, (24, 29, 23)>
<27, (25, 5, 7)>
<2, (18, 23, 24)>
<18, (2, 4, 29)>
<1, (12, 2, 3)>
<26, (8, 4, 25)>
<5, (27, 25, 7)>
<6, (7, 22, 9)>
<4, (18, 26, 8)>
<8, (26, 4, 24)>
<11, (28, 22, 25)>
<28, (11, 7, 13)>
<29, (0, 18, 4)>
<16, (14, 19, 20)>
<10, (15, 3, 13)>
<15, (14, 22, 13)>
<3, (10, 21, 12)>
<21, (3, 24, 12)>
<22, (6, 11, 15)>
<25, (27, 4, 19)>
<20, (16, 22, 21)>
<24, (14, 0, 2)>
<7, (6, 28, 25)>
<9, (17, 0, 10)>
<12, (1, 3, 23)>
<23, (0, 2, 12)>
<19, (17, 16, 25)>
<13, (28, 10, 15)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
