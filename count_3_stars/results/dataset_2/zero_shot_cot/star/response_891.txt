Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 25) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 22) (26, 12) (21, 13) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 14) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 11) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 24) (22, 12) (22, 3) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 28) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (17, 29) (29, 13) (29, 17) (29, 27) (18, 27) (18, 25) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 24) (5, 10) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 25) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 16) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 23) (16, 1) (16, 25) (16, 15) (4, 22) (4, 5) (4, 11) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (12, 2) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 16) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 23) (27, 19) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 20) (9, 0) (9, 3) (24, 22) (24, 5) (25, 2) (25, 0) (25, 18) (25, 10) (25, 16) (23, 7) (23, 20) (3, 22) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be the potential centers of 3-stars.
The nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 10, 18, 23, 24, 5, 8, 17, 19.
For each potential center node, let's check if the connected nodes form a 3-star or not.

Checking nodes connected to node 0:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 25, 9.
<0, (14, 25, 9)>

Checking nodes connected to node 1:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 20, 16.
<1, (6, 20, 16)>

Checking nodes connected to node 3:
Node 3 is connected to nodes 22, 9.
Node 3 does not form a 3-star.

Checking nodes connected to node 7:
Node 7 is connected to nodes 10, 20, 23.
<7, (10, 20, 23)>

Checking nodes connected to node 9:
Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3.
Node 9 does not form a 3-star.

Checking nodes connected to node 10:
Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 25.
<10, (5, 7, 25)>

Checking nodes connected to node 18:
Node 18 is connected to nodes 27, 25.
Node 18 does not form a 3-star.

Checking nodes connected to node 23:
Node 23 is connected to nodes 7, 20.
Node 23 does not form a 3-star.

Checking nodes connected to node 24:
Node 24 is connected to nodes 22, 5.
Node 24 does not form a 3-star.

Checking nodes connected to node 5:
Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 4, 24.
<5, (13, 4, 24)>

Checking nodes connected to node 8:
Node 8 is connected to nodes 13.
Node 8 does not form a 3-star.

Checking nodes connected to node 17:
Node 17 is connected to nodes 29.
Node 17 does not form a 3-star.

Checking nodes connected to node 19:
Node 19 is connected to nodes 26, 27.
Node 19 does not form a 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (14, 25, 9)>, <1, (6, 20, 16)>, <7, (10, 20, 23)>, <10, (5, 7, 25)>, <5, (13, 4, 24)>.
So, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
