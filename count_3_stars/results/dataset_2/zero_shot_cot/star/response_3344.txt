Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 18) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (18, 14) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 10) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 2) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 11: <11, (16, 19, 5)>
2. Node 3: <3, (0, 6, 5)>
3. Node 15: <15, (1, 13, 14)>
4. Node 17: <17, (9, 5, 4)>
5. Node 6: <6, (3, 9, 5)>
6. Node 9: <9, (17, 6, 1)>
7. Node 5: <5, (11, 3, 17)>
8. Node 4: <4, (17, 6, 10)>
9. Node 0: <0, (3, 8, 1)>
10. Node 1: <1, (15, 9, 0)>
11. Node 8: <8, (11, 0, 12)>
12. Node 19: <19, (11, 12)>
13. Node 2: <2, (13, 7)>
14. Node 18: <18, (14)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
