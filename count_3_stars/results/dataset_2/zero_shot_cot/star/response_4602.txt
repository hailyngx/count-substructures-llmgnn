Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (15, 19) (15, 2) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 8) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 16) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (13, 0) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 2) (11, 4) (11, 6) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.
1. Node 4: (4, 18), (4, 3), (4, 5) <4, (18, 3, 5)>
2. Node 18: (18, 4), (18, 5), (18, 7) <18, (4, 5, 7)>
3. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 10), (1, 7) <1, (5, 10, 7)>
4. Node 17: (17, 6), (17, 16), (17, 0) <17, (6, 16, 0)>
5. Node 10: (10, 1), (10, 19), (10, 14) <10, (1, 19, 14)>
6. Node 15: (15, 19), (15, 2) <15, (19, 2)>
7. Node 7: (7, 18), (7, 1), (7, 16) <7, (18, 1, 16)>
8. Node 16: (16, 17), (16, 7), (16, 12) <16, (17, 7, 12)>
9. Node 12: (12, 16) <12, (16)>
10. Node 9: (9, 14), (9, 19) <9, (14, 19)>
11. Node 19: (19, 10), (19, 15), (19, 9) <19, (10, 15, 9)>
12. Node 6: (6, 17), (6, 2), (6, 11) <6, (17, 2, 11)>
13. Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 18), (5, 1) <5, (4, 18, 1)>
14. Node 8: (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5) <8, (7, 6, 5)>
15. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 18), (3, 14) <3, (4, 18, 14)>
16. Node 14: (14, 10), (14, 9), (14, 3) <14, (10, 9, 3)>
17. Node 0: (0, 17), (0, 19), (0, 13), (0, 2) <0, (17, 19, 13)>
18. Node 11: (11, 4), (11, 6) <11, (4, 6)>
19. Node 2: (2, 15), (2, 6), (2, 0) <2, (15, 6, 0)>
20. Node 13: (13, 0) <13, (0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
