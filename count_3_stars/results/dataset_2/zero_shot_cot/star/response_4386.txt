Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <5, (9, 2, 4)>
   <5, (9, 2, 3)>
   <5, (9, 4, 7)>
   <5, (2, 8, 3)>
   <5, (2, 8, 4)>
   <5, (4, 0, 3)>
   <5, (4, 0, 7)>

2. Node 9 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <9, (5, 2, 4)>
   <9, (5, 2, 3)>
   <9, (5, 4, 7)>
   <9, (2, 8, 3)>
   <9, (2, 8, 4)>
   <9, (3, 6, 8)>

3. Node 6 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <6, (1, 7, 3)>
   <6, (1, 7, 4)>
   <6, (1, 7, 0)>
   <6, (3, 5, 0)>
   <6, (0, 4, 7)>
   <6, (0, 4, 3)>

4. Node 2 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <2, (5, 8, 3)>
   <2, (5, 8, 4)>
   <2, (9, 8, 3)>
   <2, (8, 3, 0)>

5. Node 8 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <8, (2, 3, 0)>
   <8, (3, 0, 1)>

6. Node 1 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <1, (9, 6, 7)>
   <1, (6, 7, 0)>

7. Node 3 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <3, (5, 0, 6)>
   <3, (5, 0, 8)>
   <3, (6, 0, 1)>
   <3, (0, 4, 7)>

8. Node 7 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <7, (5, 4, 0)>
   <7, (5, 4, 6)>
   <7, (1, 6, 0)>

9. Node 0 is a part of the following 3-stars:
   <0, (6, 4, 7)>
   <0, (6, 1, 7)>
   <0, (4, 5, 7)>

10. Node 4 is a part of the following 3-stars:
    <4, (5, 0, 6)>
    <4, (5, 0, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
