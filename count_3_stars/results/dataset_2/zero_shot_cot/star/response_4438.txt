Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 7
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7

From the given information, we can observe the following 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (4, 9, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
