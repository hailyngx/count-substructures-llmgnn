Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 16) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 18) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 1) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 12) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 17) (13, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (11, 4, 5)>
<2, (11, 9, 5)>
<3, (2, 12, 17)>
<4, (16, 1, 8)>
<5, (15, 17, 2)>
<6, (8, 14, 17)>
<7, (0, 14, 7)>
<8, (4, 8, 12)>
<9, (8, 2, 9)>
<10, (16, 10, 18)>
<11, (1, 11, 13)>
<12, (15, 8, 3)>
<13, (11, 16, 1)>
<14, (0, 7, 14)>
<15, (10, 15, 17)>
<16, (11, 4, 10)>
<17, (3, 5, 15)>
<18, (10, 18, 19)>
<19, (18, 19, 18)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [19].
