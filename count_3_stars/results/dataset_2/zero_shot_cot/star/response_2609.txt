Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.

Let's analyze the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 5: Neighbors - 9, 2, 8, 1, 4, 7 (6 neighbors - not a center of a 3-star)
2. Node 9: Neighbors - 5, 6, 2, 0 (4 neighbors - not a center of a 3-star)
3. Node 4: Neighbors - 5, 1, 6, 3 (4 neighbors - not a center of a 3-star)
4. Node 7: Neighbors - 5, 8 (2 neighbors - not a center of a 3-star)
5. Node 1: Neighbors - 5, 4, 3, 2 (4 neighbors - not a center of a 3-star)
6. Node 3: Neighbors - 4, 1, 0 (3 neighbors - potential center of a 3-star)
7. Node 6: Neighbors - 9, 4, 2, 8 (4 neighbors - not a center of a 3-star)
8. Node 8: Neighbors - 5, 7, 6, 0 (4 neighbors - not a center of a 3-star)
9. Node 2: Neighbors - 5, 9, 1, 6, 0 (5 neighbors - not a center of a 3-star)
10. Node 0: Neighbors - 9, 3, 8, 2 (4 neighbors - not a center of a 3-star)

Therefore, the only potential 3-star in this graph is centered at node 3. Let's analyze it: 

- Node 3 is connected to 4, 1, 0: <3, (4, 1, 0)>

Therefore, the final answer is: [1]
