Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 8) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 6: <6, (9, 8, 0)>
2. Node 9: <9, (6, 4, 2)>
3. Node 8: <8, (6, 13, 12)>
4. Node 13: <13, (8, 5, 11)>
5. Node 7: <7, (11, 14, 5)>
6. Node 12: <12, (9, 8, 14)>
7. Node 2: <2, (6, 9, 8)>
8. Node 5: <5, (13, 7, 4)>
9. Node 1: <1, (13, 12, 11)>
10. Node 0: <0, (6, 9, 12)>
11. Node 10: <10, (13, 2, 3)>
12. Node 11: <11, (8, 13, 7)>
13. Node 14: <14, (9, 13, 7)>
14. Node 3: <3, (8, 10, -)>  (There are only 2 edges: (10, 3) and (3, 8), so this forms a 3-star with an incomplete leaf node.)
15. Node 4: <4, (9, 5, -)>  (There are only 2 edges: (4, 9) and (4, 5), so this forms a 3-star with an incomplete leaf node.)

Count of 3-stars: [14]
