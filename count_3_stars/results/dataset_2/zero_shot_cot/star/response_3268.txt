Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. Remember that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes in the graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 5, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<7, (3, 1, 0)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have 10. 
So, the final answer is [10].
