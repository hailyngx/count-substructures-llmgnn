Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the nodes that could serve as the center of a 3-star. That is, find all nodes with exactly three edges incident upon them.

Here are the nodes with exactly three incident edges:
- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 0)
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6)
- Node 1: (1, 13), (1, 0), (1, 12)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 0)
- Node 13: (13, 1), (13, 11), (13, 14)
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 9), (3, 2)
- Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6)
- Node 11: (11, 4), (11, 13), (11, 14)
- Node 12: (12, 1), (12, 11), (12, 5)
- Node 10: (10, 7), (10, 14), (10, 2)

Now, let's construct the 3-stars:
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<1, (13, 12, 0)>
<8, (1, 6, 0)>
<13, (1, 11, 14)>
<3, (0, 9, 2)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<11, (4, 13, 14)>
<12, (1, 11, 5)>
<10, (7, 14, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
