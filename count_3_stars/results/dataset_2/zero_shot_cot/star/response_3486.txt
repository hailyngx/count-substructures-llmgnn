Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can serve as the center of a 3-star graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with exactly three neighbors.

From the list of edges, we can see that node 4, node 6, and node 1 have exactly three neighbors each. Therefore, these nodes can act as the centers of 3-star graphs.

Next, let's identify the leaves connected to each center. For each center node, we will list the nodes that are directly connected to it.

For node 4, the leaves are 7, 8, and 3. <4, (7, 8, 3)>

For node 6, the leaves are 7, 5, and 1. <6, (7, 5, 1)>

For node 1, the leaves are 4, 6, and 9. <1, (4, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <4, (7, 8, 3)>, <6, (7, 5, 1)>, and <1, (4, 6, 9)>.

In total, there are [3] 3-stars in the graph.
