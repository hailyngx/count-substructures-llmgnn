Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <4, (7, 9, 10)>
2. <7, (4, 11, 14)>
3. <1, (3, 2, 14)>
4. <3, (1, 8, 12)>
5. <8, (3, 13, 12)>
6. <13, (7, 8, 2)>
7. <10, (4, 13, 9)>
8. <11, (7, 14, 2)>
9. <5, (4, 10, 6)>
10. <6, (4, 13, 14)>
11. <9, (4, 8, 13)>
12. <2, (7, 1, 13)>
13. <14, (7, 1, 5)>
14. <0, (4, 12, 1)>
15. <12, (3, 8, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
