Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the given graph. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-star graphs. 

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 3.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 3, and 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 2, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 14.

Next, we can list out the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<6, (5, 3, 4)>
<9, (4, 14, 3)>
<10, (11, 3, 12)>
<11, (10, 14, 1)>
<7, (12, 2, 5)>
<1, (9, 10, 14)>

There are [6] 3-stars in total in the given graph.
