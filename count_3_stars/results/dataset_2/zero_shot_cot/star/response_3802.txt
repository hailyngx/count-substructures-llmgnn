Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. The count is inside brackets [12].
The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<9, (5, 0, 1)>
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 3)>
<8, (6, 1, 0)>
<(2, 5, 3), 7>
<(0, 9, 4), 8>
<(4, 0, 7), 8>
<(2, 3, 7), 5>
