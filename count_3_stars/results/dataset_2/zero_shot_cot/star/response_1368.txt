Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 16) (6, 14) (9, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 19) (19, 12) (19, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 18) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the list of edges to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (15, 10, 13)>
2. Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (3, 16, 1)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (8, 12, 10)>
4. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (8, 12, 1)>
5. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 11, 16)>
6. Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (15, 1, 0)>
7. Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (5, 2, 13)>
8. Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (8, 1, 14)>
9. Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (8, 11, 6)>
10. Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (9, 1, 10)>
11. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (11, 14, 19)>
12. Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (12, 4, -)>
13. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (3, 7, 12)>
14. Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (3, 5, 18)>
15. Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (7, 12, -)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars found in the given graph, so the answer is [15].
