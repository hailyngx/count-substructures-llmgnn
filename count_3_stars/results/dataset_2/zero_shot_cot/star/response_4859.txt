Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph. 

From the list of edges, we can see that the 3-star patterns are:
<5, (6, 2, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 1)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <4, (5, 1, 3)>, <8, (9, 3, 4)>, <2, (5, 6, 3)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (5, 9, 0)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
