Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 22) (17, 14) (17, 27) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 16) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 15) (25, 18) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 27) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 11) (13, 15) (12, 27) (27, 17) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 5) (2, 19) (18, 25) (18, 26) (18, 29) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 1) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 29) (28, 0) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 20) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 0) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 21) (23, 15) (23, 10) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 28) (11, 19) (21, 6) (21, 22) (21, 5) (26, 18) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (16, 3) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 4) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 23) (15, 5) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 10) (20, 7) (20, 28) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 27) (5, 21) (5, 15) (5, 1) (10, 23) (10, 4) (10, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (14, 22, 28)>
<3, (16, 24, 25)>
<4, (9, 10, 19)>
<5, (1, 15, 21)>
<6, (9, 11, 21)>
<7, (1, 20, 25)>
<8, (13, 25, 27)>
<9, (4, 6, 13)>
<10, (4, 10, 23)>
<11, (6, 11, 28)>
<13, (8, 11, 15)>
<14, (0, 17, 22)>
<15, (5, 13, 23)>
<16, (3, 24, 25)>
<17, (14, 17, 27)>
<18, (18, 26, 29)>
<19, (2, 4, 19)>
<20, (7, 20, 28)>
<21, (6, 21, 22)>
<22, (14, 22, 27)>
<23, (10, 15, 23)>
<24, (3, 16, 24)>
<25, (7, 15, 25)>
<26, (18, 26, 29)>
<27, (8, 17, 27)>
<28, (11, 20, 28)>
<29, (13, 18, 29)>

Total number of 3-stars: 28
