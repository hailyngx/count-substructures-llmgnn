Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 16) (3, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 8) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 13) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 2) (8, 15) (8, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 18) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 0) (13, 3) (13, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star patterns in the graph:

<11, (9, 6, 17)>
<16, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (9, 4, 17)>
<9, (11, 5, 12)>
<1, (15, 6, 4)>
<3, (16, 13, 4)>
<7, (12, 15, 17)>
<12, (9, 7, 10)>
<15, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (17, 19, 2)>
<6, (11, 1, 10)>
<19, (0, 2, 13)>
<14, (8, 18, 2)>
<8, (15, 14, 7)>
<2, (0, 19, 14)>
<18, (7, 14, 10)>
<10, (12, 6, 18)>
<17, (11, 5, 7)>
<13, (3, 19, 16)>
<4, (16, 5, 1)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
