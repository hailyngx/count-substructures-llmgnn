Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3)
- Node 9: (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3)
- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 2), (4, 1)
- Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4)
- Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 0)
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 4)
- Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 3)

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars:
<5, (2, 1, 3)>, <9, (8, 2, 3)>, <4, (7, 2, 1)>, <7, (5, 9, 4)>, <0, (7, 3, 8)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>
