Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

First, we identify all nodes that are connected to three other nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 2.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 1.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 0.

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<3, (6, 9, 1)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 0)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
