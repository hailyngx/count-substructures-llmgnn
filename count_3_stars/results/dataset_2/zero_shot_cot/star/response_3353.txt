Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (node 5) in the given graph.
These nodes are 0, 7, and 9.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
After inspecting the connections, we can see that there are multiple 3-stars in this graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (0, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 6)>

There are total [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
