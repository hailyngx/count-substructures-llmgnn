Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 11) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 18) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 9) (12, 11) (19, 10) (19, 18) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (6, 14) (6, 16) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <3, (1, 16, 17)>
2. <15, (4, 11, 13)>
3. <13, (8, 14, 16)>
4. <2, (1, 17, 8)>
5. <18, (2, 7, 19)>
6. <0, (1, 4, 11)>
7. <9, (8, 14, 18)>
8. <4, (0, 9, 15)>
9. <11, (0, 12, 15)>
10. <6, (14, 16, 3)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
