Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with degree 4, as those will be the potential center nodes of 3-stars. The nodes with degree 4 are 5, 9, 4, 7, 0.

Now, we look at each potential center node and its neighbors to identify the 3-stars:
- For node 5: (5, 1, 4, 0), (5, 1, 3, 0)
- For node 9: (9, 6, 8, 2), (9, 6, 1, 0)
- For node 4: (4, 5, 8, 0), (4, 8, 0, 2)
- For node 7: (7, 0, 3, 8), (7, 0, 1, 3)
- For node 0: (0, 5, 9, 4), (0, 9, 6, 1)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have <5, (1, 4, 0)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <0, (5, 9, 4)>. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
