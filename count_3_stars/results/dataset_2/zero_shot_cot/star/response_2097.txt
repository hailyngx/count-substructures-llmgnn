Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The nodes with degree 3 are: 5, 9, 6, 3, 4, 8, 2, and 7.

Now, let's list all possible 3-stars:

<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 3, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (9, 8, 0)>

Considering that the 3-stars are unique, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
