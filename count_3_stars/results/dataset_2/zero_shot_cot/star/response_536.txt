Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, let's identify the nodes with exactly three adjacent edges. These nodes can serve as potential centers of 3-stars. Then we need to check if those potential centers are indeed connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with exactly three adjacent edges are:
- Node 4 (edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 5))
- Node 6 (edges: (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 10))
- Node 13 (edges: (13, 1), (13, 8), (13, 11))
- Node 14 (edges: (14, 3), (14, 2), (14, 5))

Now, let's confirm if these nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes to form 3-stars:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 5. <4, (7, 8, 5)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 10. <6, (7, 1, 10)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 11. <13, (1, 8, 11)>
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 5. <14, (3, 2, 5)>

Thus, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
