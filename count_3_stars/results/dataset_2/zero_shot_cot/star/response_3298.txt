Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 8) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 11) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 13) (13, 16) (13, 11) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify nodes with degree 3
- Node 3, 7, 4, 12, 8, 16 have degree 3.

Step 2: Check if these nodes are part of a 3-star
- Node 3: (3, 7, 16), (3, 8, 16), (3, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 3, 4), (7, 3, 6), (7, 3, 12), (7, 4, 12), (7, 6, 12), (7, 1, 12)
- Node 4: (4, 7, 14), (4, 7, 10), (4, 7, 12)
- Node 12: (12, 7, 14), (12, 7, 15), (12, 7, 4), (12, 14, 15)
- Node 8: (8, 3, 19), (8, 3, 16), (8, 19, 16)
- Node 16: (16, 3, 17), (16, 3, 8), (16, 17, 8), (16, 17, 13)

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars
<3, (7, 8, 16)>, <4, (7, 10, 14)>, <12, (7, 14, 15)>, <16, (3, 17, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
