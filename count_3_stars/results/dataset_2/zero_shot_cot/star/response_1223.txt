Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 5) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 10, 2, and 0.

Now, let's count the 3-stars with each of these nodes as the center:

- For node 1: (1, 6, 10), (1, 10, 14)
- For node 10: (10, 1, 2)
- For node 2: (2, 10, 0)
- For node 0: (0, 2, 13)

Finally, count the total number of unique 3-stars:

<1, 6, 10>, <1, 10, 14>, <10, 1, 2>, <2, 10, 0>, <0, 2, 13>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
