Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 19) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 17) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 1) (11, 2) (11, 18) (14, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 19) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them since those nodes will be at the center of the 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are: 5, 6, 7, 2, 8, 4, 1, 15, 19, 0, 16, 11, 14, 10, 3.

Now, we will go through each of these nodes one by one and check if they form 3-stars with the adjacent nodes.

For node 5:
- <5, (13, 17, 3)> is a 3-star.

For node 6:
- <6, (7, 2, 13)> is a 3-star.
- <6, (13, 5, 3)> is a 3-star.

For node 7:
- <7, (6, 12, 10)> is a 3-star.
- <7, (10, 18, 7)> is a 3-star.

For node 2:
- <2, (6, 3, 14)> is a 3-star.

For node 8:
No 3-star is formed with node 8.

For node 4:
- <4, (19, 0, 9)> is a 3-star.
- <4, (9, 3, 0)> is a 3-star.

For node 1:
No 3-star is formed with node 1.

For node 15:
- <15, (12, 1, 0)> is a 3-star.

For node 19:
- <19, (8, 17, 4)> is a 3-star.

For node 0:
- <0, (15, 4, 9)> is a 3-star.
- <0, (4, 18, 0)> is a 3-star.

For node 16:
No 3-star is formed with node 16.

For node 11:
- <11, (2, 18, 14)> is a 3-star.

For node 14:
- <14, (2, 11, 18)> is a 3-star.

For node 10:
- <10, (7, 9, 10)> is a 3-star.

For node 3:
No 3-star is formed with node 3.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph [10].
Unique 3-stars: <5, (13, 17, 3)>, <6, (7, 2, 13)>, <6, (13, 5, 3)>, <7, (6, 12, 10)>, <7, (10, 18, 7)>, <2, (6, 3, 14)>, <4, (19, 0, 9)>, <4, (9, 3, 0)>, <15, (12, 1, 0)>, <19, (8, 17, 4)>
