Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. 

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 10.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 11.

So, the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (9, 13, 4)>
<3, (6, 9, 10)>
<5, (2, 7, 11)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
