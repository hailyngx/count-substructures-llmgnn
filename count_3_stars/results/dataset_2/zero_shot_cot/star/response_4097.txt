Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 4 since it will be the central node of our 3-stars. Nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are connected to node 4, but we need to check if they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Checking each node:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, and 2. Not a 3-star.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 1, 5, and 9. Not a 3-star.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 1, 8, and 0. Not a 3-star.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 6, 2, and 8. Not a 3-star.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 9, 5, and 1. A potential 3-star.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 2, and 8. Not a 3-star.

Therefore, the only potential 3-star in the graph is centered at node 7. Let's confirm if it indeed forms a 3-star:
- <7, (4, 1, 9)> forms a 3-star.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found in the graph is <7, (4, 1, 9)>.
