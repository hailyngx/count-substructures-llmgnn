Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 5.
2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 2.
3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 8.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 2.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 2.
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8.
7. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1.
8. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 3.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 9, 5.
10. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 5.

Thus, we have identified all the 3-stars in the graph. Now, let's count them and put the unique ones inside brackets.

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 3, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 2)>
<6, (3, 9, 2)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 9, 5)>
<0, (6, 9, 5)>

Thus, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
