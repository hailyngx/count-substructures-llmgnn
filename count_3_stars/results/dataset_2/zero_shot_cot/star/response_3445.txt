Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 5) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (9, 18) (9, 8) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 12) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (16, 18) (16, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs can be identified by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 13)>
<1, (11, 14, 8)>
<3, (4, 14, -missing node-)>
<4, (3, 18, 19)>
<5, (0, 13, 12)>
<7, (11, 19, 17)>
<8, (1, 9, 10)>
<9, (18, 8, -missing node-)>
<11, (1, 7, 12)>
<12, (18, 5, 11)>
<13, (0, 5, -missing node-)>
<14, (1, 3, -missing node-)>
<16, (18, 15, -missing node-)>
<17, (5, 8, 7)>
<18, (4, 9, 16)>
<19, (0, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
