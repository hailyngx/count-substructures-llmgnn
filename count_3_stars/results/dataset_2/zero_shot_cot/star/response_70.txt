Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (27, 15) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (25, 11) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 20) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 0) (23, 13) (23, 28) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 25) (18, 21) (2, 8) (2, 5) (22, 3) (26, 24) (26, 16) (28, 23) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 13) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 24) (17, 19) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 5) (0, 8) (0, 23) (7, 24) (7, 3) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 21) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (16, 10) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 3) (3, 22) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 16) (3, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 24) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 28) (19, 28) (19, 17) (6, 3) (6, 29) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 6) (29, 21) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 29) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 4) (13, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 15: <15, (27, 29, 14)>
2. Node 20: <20, (25, 8, 13)>
3. Node 25: <25, (20, 18, 11)>
4. Node 8: <8, (20, 23, 2)>
5. Node 23: <23, (8, 0, 13)>
6. Node 4: <4, (12, 13, 5)>
7. Node 11: <11, (25, 21, 0)>
8. Node 2: <2, (8, 5, )>
9. Node 26: <26, (24, 16, )>
10. Node 28: <28, (23, 14, 19)>
11. Node 17: <17, (4, 24, 19)>
12. Node 24: <24, (26, 17, 7)>
13. Node 0: <0, (8, 23, )>
14. Node 7: <7, (24, 3, )>
15. Node 9: <9, (20, 8, 24)>
16. Node 12: <12, (4, 1, 3)>
17. Node 16: <16, (10, 26, 29)>
18. Node 3: <3, (22, 7, 12)>
19. Node 5: <5, (4, 2, 24)>
20. Node 14: <14, (15, 28, 10)>
21. Node 19: <19, (28, 17, )>
22. Node 6: <6, (3, 29, )>
23. Node 29: <29, (15, 16, 6)>
24. Node 21: <21, (11, 18, 9)>
25. Node 13: <13, (20, 23, 4)>

Finally, we count the number of unique 3-stars found, which is [25].
