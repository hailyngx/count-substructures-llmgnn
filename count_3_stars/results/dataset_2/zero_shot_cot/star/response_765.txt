Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 2) (21, 17) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 28) (10, 8) (10, 28) (5, 21) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 19) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 15) (28, 13) (28, 10) (28, 12) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 25) (29, 14) (29, 3) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 27) (22, 9) (22, 1) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 20) (20, 7) (20, 17) (20, 3) (23, 14) (19, 6) (19, 29) (19, 15) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 26) (26, 5) (26, 16) (26, 14) (26, 25) (4, 16) (4, 14) (14, 29) (14, 23) (14, 26) (14, 4) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 19) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 0) (1, 5) (1, 22) (1, 2) (2, 21) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (25, 13) (25, 29) (25, 26) (25, 24) (24, 25) (27, 9) (3, 5) (3, 29) (3, 20) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 21, 12, 16, 20, and 18.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 2, and 17.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 28, 18, and 15.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 13, 10, 12, and 29.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 28, 19, 25, 14, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 17, 2, and 19.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 4, 26, and 14.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 5, 16, 14, and 25.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 16, 14, and 23.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 29, 23, 26, and 4.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Since Node 7 is connected to nodes 21, 12, and 16, we have <7, (21, 12, 16)>.
- Since Node 21 is connected to nodes 7, 5, and 2, we have <21, (7, 5, 2)>.
- Since Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 28, and 18, we have <12, (7, 28, 18)>.
- Since Node 28 is connected to nodes 13, 10, and 12, we have <28, (13, 10, 12)>.
- Since Node 29 is connected to nodes 28, 19, and 25, we have <29, (28, 19, 25)>.
- Since Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 17, and 2, we have <6, (5, 17, 2)>.
- Since Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 4, and 26, we have <16, (7, 4, 26)>.
- Since Node 26 is connected to nodes 5, 16, and 14, we have <26, (5, 16, 14)>.
- Since Node 4 is connected to nodes 16, 14, and 23, we have <4, (16, 14, 23)>.
- Since Node 14 is connected to nodes 29, 23, and 26, we have <14, (29, 23, 26)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
