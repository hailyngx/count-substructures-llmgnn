Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (14, 11) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. 

For each node, count how many edges are connected to it:
- Node 0: 4 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 5 edges
- Node 3: 3 edges
- Node 4: 4 edges
- Node 5: 3 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 5 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 9: 5 edges
- Node 10: 4 edges
- Node 11: 5 edges
- Node 12: 5 edges
- Node 13: 4 edges
- Node 14: 2 edges

Now, we can list the 3-stars:
<2, (9, 13, 1)>
<3, (7, 11, 12)>
<7, (6, 5, 8)>
<9, (6, 11, 2)>
<10, (9, 4, 8)>
<11, (7, 3, 14)>
<12, (6, 1, 3)>
<13, (1, 2, 14)>
<14, (13, 11, 14)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
