Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 14) (16, 29) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 15) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 25) (12, 3) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 7) (27, 6) (4, 8) (4, 20) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 21) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 18) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 6) (20, 4) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 6) (18, 17) (18, 7) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 1) (13, 5) (13, 26) (26, 13) (26, 14) (1, 10) (1, 22) (1, 15) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 21) (23, 11) (23, 10) (29, 16) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 24) (14, 11) (14, 26) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 24) (24, 29) (24, 2) (28, 5) (28, 8) (6, 27) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 20) (6, 22) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 25) (3, 12) (3, 20) (3, 19) (25, 12) (25, 15) (25, 21) (7, 27) (7, 18) (19, 16) (19, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 22, and 29.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 25, and 27.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 17, and 23.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 29.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 22.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 21, and 25.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 21, and 28.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 20.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3, 16, and 19.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars are:
<9, (5, 22, 29)>
<12, (2, 25, 27)>
<10, (1, 17, 23)>
<27, (6, 7, 29)>
<5, (9, 13, 22)>
<15, (1, 21, 25)>
<8, (4, 21, 28)>
<4, (2, 8, 20)>
<19, (3, 16, 19)>
