Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 12) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 10: <4, (0, 1, 10)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 12, and 13: <7, (2, 12, 13)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 12, and 13: <6, (5, 12, 13)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 10, and 14: <9, (8, 10, 14)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 11: <10, (4, 9, 11)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 10: <11, (3, 8, 10)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3: <5, (0, 2, 3)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [6]
