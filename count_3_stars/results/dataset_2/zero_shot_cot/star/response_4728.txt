Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
To find the 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 13)>
2. Node 9: <9, (2, 6, 12)>
3. Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 11)>
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 6, 11)>, <3, (1, 6, 14)>, <3, (6, 8, 14)>, <3, (6, 11, 14)>
5. Node 2: <2, (5, 9, 14)>
6. Node 8: <8, (3, 6, 5)>, <8, (6, 8, 10)>, <8, (6, 8, 5)>
7. Node 11: <11, (1, 3, 0)>, <11, (1, 3, 5)>, <11, (3, 6, 13)>
8. Node 0: <0, (10, 11, 13)>, <0, (10, 11, 4)>, <0, (11, 0, 7)>, <0, (11, 0, 13)>
9. Node 7: <7, (0, 14, 7)>
10. Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 12)>
11. Node 12: <12, (4, 9, 12)>
12. Node 10: <10, (0, 8, 13)>, <10, (0, 8, 14)>, <10, (0, 11, 13)>, <10, (8, 10, 14)>
13. Node 5: <5, (2, 8, 14)>, <5, (3, 4, 5)>, <5, (4, 5, 14)>, <5, (5, 11, 14)>

After identifying the 3-stars for each node, we can count the total number of 3-stars. The total count is [23] 3-stars in the given graph.
