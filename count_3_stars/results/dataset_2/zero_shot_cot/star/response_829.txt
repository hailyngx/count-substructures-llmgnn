Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 5 3-stars in the given graph.
