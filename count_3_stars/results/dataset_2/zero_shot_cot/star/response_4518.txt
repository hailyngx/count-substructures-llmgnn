Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 4) (10, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 15) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 4) (7, 16) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 5) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 14) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 6) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (6, 19) (6, 15) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 19) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 16) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 15) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 2) (9, 13) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars. A 3-star is formed by a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Analyzing the given edge list, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<1, (2, 0, 19)>
<3, (17, 13, 4)>
<10, (12, 5, 0)>
<11, (14, 15, 5)>
<17, (3, 8, 4)>
<7, (16, 14, 5)>
<12, (10, 5, 0)>
<18, (19, 14, 6)>
<16, (7, 2, 5)>
<6, (19, 15, 2)>
<0, (1, 8, 13)>
<14, (11, 4, 19)>
<5, (11, 12, 16)>
<8, (17, 0, 15)>
<2, (1, 16, 6)>
<9, (13, 2, 0)>
<15, (11, 6, 8)>
<13, (3, 0, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars identified: <18>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
