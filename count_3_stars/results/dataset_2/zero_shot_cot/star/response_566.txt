Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 29) (20, 6) (20, 5) (25, 27) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 24) (13, 27) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (3, 5) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 19) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 10) (28, 2) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 10) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 21) (9, 28) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 7) (18, 26) (18, 27) (21, 3) (21, 26) (21, 23) (21, 14) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 23) (29, 11) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 19) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 15) (16, 7) (11, 29) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 21) (14, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 28) (23, 21) (23, 29) (23, 10) (19, 3) (19, 12) (19, 17) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 23) (15, 12) (15, 7) (27, 25) (27, 13) (27, 18) (24, 13) (24, 4) (24, 2) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 24) (17, 4) (17, 19) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all the nodes that have 3 incident edges. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars. 

The nodes with 3 incident edges are: 
- Node 10
- Node 21
- Node 26

Next, let's find all possible 3-stars centered at these nodes:

1. For Node 10:
<10, (6, 28, 22)>
<10, (6, 28, 26)>
<10, (6, 28, 23)>
<10, (6, 22, 26)>
<10, (6, 22, 23)>
<10, (6, 26, 23)>
Total: 6

2. For Node 21:
<21, (3, 26, 14)>
<21, (3, 14, 23)>
Total: 2

3. For Node 26:
<26, (22, 10, 21)>
Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
