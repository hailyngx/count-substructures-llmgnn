Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, it's important to identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected in a star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 0)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<7, (9, 6, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 3, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
