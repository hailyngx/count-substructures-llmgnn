Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 12) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 3) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 21) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 10) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 7) (2, 18) (2, 27) (2, 24) (2, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 20) (3, 4) (3, 29) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 21) (24, 8) (24, 2) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 17) (15, 21) (20, 6) (20, 7) (20, 23) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 10) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 7) (25, 0) (14, 6) (7, 26) (7, 2) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 13) (5, 28) (5, 12) (5, 22) (5, 27) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 5) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 13) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 22) (22, 6) (22, 5) (22, 0) (27, 2) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 23) (10, 19) (10, 9) (10, 16) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all occurrences of 3-stars.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them to find potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are:
- Node 4 (connected to 3, 8, 23)
- Node 8 (connected to 4, 9, 24)
- Node 28 (connected to 3, 19, 29)
- Node 3 (connected to 4, 9, 29)
- Node 19 (connected to 12, 26, 28)
- Node 9 (connected to 3, 8, 10)
- Node 12 (connected to 5, 8, 19)
- Node 29 (connected to 3, 28, 4)
- Node 5 (connected to 12, 22, 28)
- Node 10 (connected to 16, 19, 9)
- Node 16 (connected to 1, 18, 10)
- Node 21 (connected to 11, 15, 18)

2. For each potential center identified above, check if it forms a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<4, (3, 8, 23)>
<8, (4, 9, 24)>
<28, (3, 19, 29)>
<3, (4, 9, 29)>
<19, (12, 26, 28)>
<9, (3, 8, 10)>
<12, (5, 8, 19)>
<29, (3, 28, 4)>
<5, (12, 22, 28)>
<10, (16, 19, 9)>
<16, (1, 18, 10)>
<21, (11, 15, 18)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars: [12]
