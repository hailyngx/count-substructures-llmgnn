Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star pattern. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes and their connections that form 3-stars are:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 6, 8
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 14
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 7, 8
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 10, 12
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 11
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 4, 11, 12
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 1, 5, 10
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 0, 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 14)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 10, 12)>
<6, (1, 2, 11)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<10, (4, 11, 12)>
<12, (1, 5, 10)>
<14, (0, 2)>
