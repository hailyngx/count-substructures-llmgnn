Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 22) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) (0, 20) (0, 23) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 21) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 8) (26, 10) (24, 27) (24, 10) (4, 27) (27, 18) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 7) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 6) (28, 18) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 8) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 25) (23, 0) (23, 11) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 25) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 22) (7, 27) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 13) (29, 27) (29, 7) (29, 22) (29, 21) (25, 11) (25, 10) (25, 6) (19, 1) (19, 11) (21, 2) (21, 20) (21, 29) (21, 22) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 15) (6, 16) (6, 25) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (12, 14) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 15) (22, 17) (22, 3) (22, 29) (22, 21) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (20, 23, 1)>
<1, (20, 19, 8)>
<2, (18, 16, 21)>
<3, (17, 8, 7)>
<4, (27, 10, 24)>
<5, (17, 7, 15)>
<6, (25, 16, 6)>
<7, (27, 3, 13)>
<8, (18, 1, 9)>
<9, (18, 16, 8)>
<10, (26, 24, 25)>
<11, (23, 19, 13)>
<12, (14, 17, 12)>
<13, (11, 7, 15)>
<14, (17, 12, 14)>
<15, (8, 13, 5)>
<16, (2, 9, 6)>
<17, (14, 3, 5)>
<18, (2, 9, 8)>
<19, (1, 11, 13)>
<20, (0, 1, 21)>
<21, (2, 20, 22)>
<22, (17, 3, 29)>
<23, (0, 11, 14)>
<24, (27, 4, 10)>
<25, (11, 6, 25)>
<26, (10, 2, 26)>
<27, (18, 4, 27)>
<28, (18, 8, 28)>
<29, (27, 7, 29)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars present in the graph. 
This gives us a total of 29 unique 3-star configurations. 
Therefore, the final answer is [29].
