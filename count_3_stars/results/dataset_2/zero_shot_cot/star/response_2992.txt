Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (17, 5) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 6) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (9, 11) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be potential center nodes of 3-stars. We'll look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors in the graph.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 1
- Node 5

Next, for each potential center node, let's find the nodes that can form 3-stars with the center node.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 16, 8, 4, 5, and 10.

There are no 3-stars with Node 1 as the center node because it has more than 3 neighbors.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 17, 13, 12, and 1.

List of unique 3-stars:
<5, (17, 13, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
