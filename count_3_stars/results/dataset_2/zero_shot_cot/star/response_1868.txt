Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Starting from each node, count the number of 3-stars it is part of.
2. For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it should have exactly three neighbors connected by edges.

Here is the list of 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
