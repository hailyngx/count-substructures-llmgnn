Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (8, 2, 1)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 1, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (7, 1, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (4, 3, 0)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
