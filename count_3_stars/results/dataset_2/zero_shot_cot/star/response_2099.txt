Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 17) (16, 28) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (0, 21) (0, 19) (27, 11) (27, 19) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 13) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (1, 20) (26, 25) (26, 4) (2, 11) (2, 4) (28, 16) (28, 29) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 14) (22, 9) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 14) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 18) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 18) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 7) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 5) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 18) (18, 23) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 25) (12, 11) (12, 16) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 24) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 21) (24, 8) (24, 20) (24, 13) (24, 14) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 24) (4, 15) (4, 26) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:
- <3, (15, 17, 29)>
- <11, (2, 12, 27)>
- <7, (14, 20, 25)>
- <8, (10, 23, 24)>
- <18, (9, 17, 19)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
