Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 26) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (27, 21) (27, 11) (27, 16) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 14) (21, 27) (21, 7) (21, 4) (21, 18) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 6) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 20) (10, 29) (11, 0) (11, 27) (11, 23) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 10) (2, 29) (2, 9) (29, 10) (29, 2) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 28) (26, 3) (26, 1) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 24) (6, 22) (6, 23) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 20) (18, 21) (18, 13) (16, 27) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 25) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 28) (17, 3) (17, 8) (25, 5) (25, 28) (19, 22) (19, 12) (14, 7) (14, 8) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 19) (20, 10) (20, 4) (20, 16) (24, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the set of nodes that form a 3-star structure.

Let's list down the possible 3-stars:
<3, (15, 17, 23)>
<15, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (10, 11, 27)>
<7, (15, 21, 16)>
<21, (27, 7, 4)>
<22, (19, 4, 6)>
<23, (3, 11, 6)>
<10, (0, 2, 29)>
<11, (0, 27, 23)>
<8, (13, 17, 12)>
<13, (8, 18, 17)>
<2, (10, 29, 9)>
<29, (10, 2, 28)>
<1, (15, 26, 5)>
<26, (3, 1, 28)>
<5, (1, 25, 24)>
<6, (22, 23, 4)>
<4, (21, 22, 20)>
<18, (21, 13, 12)>
<16, (27, 7, 28)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
