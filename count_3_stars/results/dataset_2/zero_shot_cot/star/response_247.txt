Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 to determine the 3-stars involving node 5:
- Node 0 is connected to node 5
- Node 3 is connected to node 5
- Node 7 is connected to node 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars using node 5 as the central node:
<5, (0, 3, 7)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 9 to determine the 3-stars involving node 9:
- Node 8 is connected to node 9
- Node 4 is connected to node 9
- Node 2 is connected to node 9
- Node 0 is connected to node 9

Now, let's identify the 3-stars using node 9 as the central node:
<9, (8, 4, 2)>
<9, (8, 4, 0)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 3
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
