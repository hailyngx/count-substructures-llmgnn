Response:
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can find 3-stars by considering each node as a potential central node and examining its adjacent nodes.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 0: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 17 and 20.
2. For node 1: <1, (6, 22, 24)> is a 3-star.
3. For node 2: <2, (13, 21, 7)> is a 3-star.
4. For node 3: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 21 and 26.
5. For node 4: <4, (15, 11, 19)> is a 3-star.
6. For node 5: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 15, 22, and 26.
7. For node 6: <6, (9, 1, 22)> is a 3-star.
8. For node 7: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 13, 14, 16, and 26.
9. For node 8: <8, (14, 11, 29)> is a 3-star.
10. For node 9: <9, (6, 27, 29)> is a 3-star.
11. For node 10: <10, (18, 17, 28)> is a 3-star.
12. For node 11: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 4, 8, 20, and 28.
13. For node 12: No 3-stars as it only has a connection with node 29.
14. For node 13: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 2 and 7.
15. For node 14: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 7, 8, 25, and 26.
16. For node 15: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 4, 19, and 20.
17. For node 16: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 7 and 22.
18. For node 17: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 10, 23, and 28.
19. For node 18: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 10 and 23.
20. For node 19: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 4, 15, 20, and 27.
21. For node 20: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 0, 11, 15, and 19.
22. For node 21: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 2 and 3.
23. For node 22: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 1, 5, and 16.
24. For node 23: <23, (18, 17, 29)> is a 3-star.
25. For node 24: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 1, 19, 27, and 28.
26. For node 25: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 8, 14, and 27.
27. For node 26: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 3, 5, 7, and 14.
28. For node 27: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 9, 19, 24, and 25.
29. For node 28: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 10, 11, 24, and 27.
30. For node 29: No 3-stars as it only has connections with nodes 9, 12, 23, and 27.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (6, 22, 24)>, 
<2, (13, 21, 7)>, 
<4, (15, 11, 19)>, 
<8, (14, 11, 29)>, 
<9, (6, 27, 29)>, 
<23, (18, 17, 29)>.
