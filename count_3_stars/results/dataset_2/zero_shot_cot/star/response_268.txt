Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges. Since there are 10 nodes, we can go through each node and count the number of edges it shares with the center node (node 5).

Nodes connected to the center node (node 5) with exactly three edges: 0, 3, 6

Now, for each of these nodes, we can identify the leaves connected to them. 

For node 0:
Leaves connected to node 0: 5, 7, 1, 3
<0, (5, 7, 1)>, <0, (5, 7, 3)>, <0, (5, 1, 3)>

For node 3:
Leaves connected to node 3: 5, 1, 0, 2, 8
<3, (5, 1, 0)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, <3, (5, 0, 2)>, <3, (5, 0, 8)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>

For node 6:
Leaves connected to node 6: 5, 1, 2
<6, (5, 1, 2)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 
[9] 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 1)>, <0, (5, 7, 3)>, <0, (5, 1, 3)>, <3, (5, 1, 0)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, <3, (5, 0, 2)>, <3, (5, 0, 8)>, <3, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 1, 2)>
