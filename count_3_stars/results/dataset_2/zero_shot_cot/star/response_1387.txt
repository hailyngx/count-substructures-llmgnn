Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can search for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting to them, forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<1, (6, 5, 12)>
<3, (1, 0, 13)>
<6, (1, 10, 5)>
<9, (2, 11, 14)>
<10, (6, 11, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 2)>
<13, (4, 3, 2)>
<12, (7, 1, 5)>
<2, (9, 10, 8)>
<0, (7, 3, 12)>
<14, (9, 5, 12)>
<5, (1, 8, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
