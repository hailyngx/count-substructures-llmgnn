Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 5) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 2) (12, 11) (12, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes connected in the form of a 3-star.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 13, 14)>
<1, (0, 8, 15)>
<3, (1, 9, 4)>
<4, (3, 8, 5)>
<5, (4, 15, 19)>
<6, (7, 15, 16)>
<7, (8, 11, 13)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 19)>
<11, (7, 12, 17)>
<12, (6, 11, 16)>
<13, (0, 7, 15)>
<14, (0, 17, 13)>
<15, (1, 5, 6)>
<16, (2, 6, 19)>
<17, (6, 11, 14)>
<19, (5, 9, 16)>

From the listed 3-stars above, we can see that there are 17 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
