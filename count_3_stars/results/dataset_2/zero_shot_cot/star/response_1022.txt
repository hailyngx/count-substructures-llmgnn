Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 10) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 17) (3, 4) (3, 14) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <4, (2, 8, 3)>
2. <5, (0, 17, 15)>
3. <7, (12, 18, 14)>
4. <9, (1, 12, 15)>
5. <10, (6, 16, 14)>
6. <11, (0, 13, 2)>
7. <19, (13, 17, 18)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
