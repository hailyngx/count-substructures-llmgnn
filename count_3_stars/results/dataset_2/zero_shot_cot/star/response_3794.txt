Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes for possible 3-stars. 
We will list the nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

The nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 4 (neighbors: 7, 1, 6)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 4, 0, 9, 1)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 9, 5, 0)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 8, 6, 2)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 4, 8, 5, 0)
- Node 0 (neighbors: 7, 8, 6, 2)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 5, 0, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 7, 8, 2, 3)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 4, 7)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 4, 8, 5, 6, 9)

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph using the central nodes identified:

<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<8, (9, 5, 0)>
<6, (4, 8, 5)>
<0, (7, 8, 2)>

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars, we get:
