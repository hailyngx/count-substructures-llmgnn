Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (6, 8, 3)>
<9, (2, 10, 1)>
<4, (8, 5, 0)>
<8, (5, 4, 0)>
<10, (9, 11, 3)>
<11, (10, 14, 0)>
<6, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (9, 6, 3)>
<1, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (14, 1, 6)>
<3, (5, 10, 6)>
<13, (10, 11, 12)>
<12, (13, 14, 0)>
<14, (7, 11, 6)>
<0, (9, 11, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [15]
