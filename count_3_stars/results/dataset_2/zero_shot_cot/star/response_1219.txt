Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 12) (14, 4) (17, 2) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 18) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 7) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 16) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 0) (6, 16) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 6) (0, 19) (0, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

List of unique 3-stars:
<3, (10, 12, 15)>
<4, (2, 11, 14)>
<8, (10, 11, 18)>
<15, (3, 7, 12)>
<19, (11, 0, 1)>
