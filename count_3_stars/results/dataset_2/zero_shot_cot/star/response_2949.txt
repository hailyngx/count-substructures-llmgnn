Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 0) (26, 13) (26, 10) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 15) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 23) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 10) (14, 21) (17, 1) (17, 8) (21, 14) (21, 8) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 19) (22, 5) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 23) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 8) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 25) (20, 18) (20, 29) (20, 10) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 8) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 25) (23, 7) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 22) (19, 5) (25, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 5) (10, 12) (16, 4) (24, 7) (24, 25) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 12) (28, 4) (28, 14) (12, 18) (12, 23) (12, 10) (12, 15) (3, 6) (3, 23) (8, 17) (8, 21) (8, 1) (8, 29) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes with degree 3 to find potential central nodes for 3-stars. These are nodes: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 18, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 29. Let's pick one of these nodes as the potential center to check for 3-stars. 

1. Central node: 0
   - (0, 9, 6), (0, 6, 15)
<0, (9, 6, 15)>
   
2. Central node: 4
   - (4, 7, 15), (4, 7, 24), (4, 7, 28), (4, 7, 16)
<4, (7, 15, 24)>

3. Central node: 5
   - (5, 10, 22), (5, 10, 19), (5, 10, 12)
<5, (10, 19, 22)>

4. Central node: 6
   - (6, 9, 15), (6, 9, 3)
<6, (9, 15, 3)>

5. Central node: 7
   - (7, 4, 15)
<7, (4, 15, 24)>

6. Central node: 13
   - (13, 26, 29), (13, 26, 1), (13, 26, 23), (13, 1, 29), (13, 1, 8), (13, 1, 23)
<13, (26, 1, 29)>

7. Central node: 14
   - (14, 22, 28), (14, 22, 10), (14, 22, 19)
<14, (22, 28, 10)>

8. Central node: 18
   - (18, 20, 10), (18, 20, 25)
<18, (20, 10, 25)>

9. Central node: 20
   - (20, 18, 29), (20, 18, 10)
<20, (18, 29, 10)>

10. Central node: 22
    - (22, 9, 5), (22, 14, 19)
<22, (9, 5, 14)>

11. Central node: 23
    - (23, 7, 11), (23, 13, 12)
<23, (7, 11, 12)>

12. Central node: 25
    - (25, 18, 24)
<25, (18, 24, 20)>

13. Central node: 26
    - (26, 13, 10)
<26, (13, 10, 29)>

14. Central node: 27
    - (27, 0, 11)
<27, (0, 11, 15)>

15. Central node: 29
    - (29, 20, 8), (29, 13, 1)
<29, (20, 8, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
