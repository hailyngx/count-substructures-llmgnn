Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (3, 2, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (9, 1, 2)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>

[There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
