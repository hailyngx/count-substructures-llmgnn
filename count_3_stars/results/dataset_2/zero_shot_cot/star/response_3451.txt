Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (9, 15) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 12) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 8) (19, 4) (19, 11) (19, 0) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 14) (8, 3) (8, 10) (16, 15) (16, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Starting from the first edge (5, 18), we see if it forms a 3-star.
1. <5, (18, 15, 16)>
   Explanation: Node 5 as central node connected to nodes 18, 15, and 16.

Continuing this process for all edges, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 12, 19)>
<6, (12, 14, 18)>
<1, (15, 2, 10)>
<17, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (17, 8, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
