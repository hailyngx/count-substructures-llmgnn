Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves to find the 3-stars.

The central nodes are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 6, 2, 0

Now, let's find the leaves for each central node:
- For central node 5: Leaves are 9, 8, 0, 7
- For central node 9: Leaves are 5, 4, 2, 3
- For central node 4: Leaves are 9, 7, 8, 1, 6
- For central node 7: Leaves are 5, 4, 6, 2, 1
- For central node 1: Leaves are 4, 7, 3, 8
- For central node 3: Leaves are 9, 1, 8
- For central node 8: Leaves are 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 0
- For central node 6: Leaves are 4, 7
- For central node 2: Leaves are 9, 7, 8, 0
- For central node 0: Leaves are 5, 8, 2

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 8)>
<8, (4, 1, 3)>
<6, (4, 7)>
<2, (9, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 8, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
