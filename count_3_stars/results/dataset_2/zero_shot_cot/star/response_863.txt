Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 11) (6, 13) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's count the number of occurrences of each node being the central node in a 3-star:

- Node 1 occurs in 3 stars: (1, 2, 4), (1, 5, 7), (1, 4, 14)
- Node 2 occurs in 2 stars: (2, 1, 13), (2, 14, 11)
- Node 3 occurs in 0 stars
- Node 4 occurs in 3 stars: (4, 1, 8), (4, 8, 10), (4, 1, 14)
- Node 5 occurs in 2 stars: (5, 1, 7), (5, 0, 11)
- Node 6 occurs in 0 stars
- Node 7 occurs in 2 stars: (7, 3, 5), (7, 12, 9)
- Node 8 occurs in 1 star: (8, 4, 10)
- Node 9 occurs in 2 stars: (9, 0, 10), (9, 7, 11)
- Node 10 occurs in 3 stars: (10, 8, 4), (10, 0, 9), (10, 6, 14)
- Node 11 occurs in 2 stars: (11, 8, 13), (11, 5, 2)
- Node 12 occurs in 1 star: (12, 3, 7)
- Node 13 occurs in 3 stars: (13, 3, 12), (13, 2, 11), (13, 6, 10)
- Node 14 occurs in 1 star: (14, 2, 1)

Based on the above count, we have the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 14)>, <1, (4, 8, 10)>, <1, (5, 7, 10)>, <1, (2, 1, 13)>, <1, (5, 0, 11)>, <3, (7, 12, 9)>, <8, (4, 10, 0)>, <10, (6, 13, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
