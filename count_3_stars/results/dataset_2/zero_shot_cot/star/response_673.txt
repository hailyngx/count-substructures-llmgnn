Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 12) (23, 13) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 8) (25, 28) (12, 23) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 28) (27, 12) (27, 10) (27, 6) (0, 1) (0, 19) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 27) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (28, 25) (28, 12) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 10) (19, 0) (19, 29) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 15) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 9) (18, 5) (18, 26) (8, 25) (8, 11) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 21) (10, 27) (10, 29) (21, 9) (21, 4) (21, 24) (4, 12) (4, 21) (11, 8) (11, 24) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 14) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 16) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 20) (14, 24) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 15) (7, 14) (1, 25) (1, 0) (1, 13) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 2) (16, 15) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's go through the graph step-by-step:
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 23, and 5. <22, (17, 23, 5)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 22, and 12. <23, (17, 22, 12)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 20, and 28. <25, (1, 20, 28)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 23. <12, (4, 9, 23)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 10, and 12. <27, (6, 10, 12)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 29, and 12. <28, (25, 29, 12)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 10, and 28. <29, (19, 10, 28)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 15, and 18. <26, (13, 15, 18)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 9, and 23. <13, (1, 9, 23)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 15, and 26. <18, (5, 15, 26)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 15, and 2. <16, (2, 15, 2)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the answer is [10].
