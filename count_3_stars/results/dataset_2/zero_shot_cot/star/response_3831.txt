Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. Identify the nodes connected to node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3, and 7.

2. Identify the nodes connected to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 6, and 3.

3. Identify the nodes connected to node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 0, and 3.

4. Identify the nodes connected to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 1, and 7.

5. Identify the nodes connected to node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 1, and 0.

6. Identify the nodes connected to node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 2, and 7.

7. Identify the nodes connected to node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 0, and 3.

8. Identify the nodes connected to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 2, and 0.

9. Identify the nodes connected to node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 8, and 7.

From the above information, we can see four unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<4, (8, 2, 6)>
<8, (4, 2, 3)>
<6, (5, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
