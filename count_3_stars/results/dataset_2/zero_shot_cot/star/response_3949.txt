Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes. So, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (6, 0, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<1, (4, 3, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 2)>
<6, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (9, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: [10].
