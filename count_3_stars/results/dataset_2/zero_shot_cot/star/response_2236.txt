Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges.

1. Node 4 is the center of the following 3-stars:
   - <4, (7, 9, 5)>
   - <4, (2, 6, 5)>
   
2. Node 7 is the center of the following 3-star:
   - <7, (4, 1, 8)>

3. Node 6 is the center of the following 3-star:
   - <6, (4, 5, 3)>

4. Node 9 is the center of the following 3-star:
   - <9, (4, 8, 2)>

5. Node 1 is the center of the following 3-star:
   - <1, (7, 9, 3)>

6. Node 3 is the center of the following 3-star:
   - <3, (6, 1, 5)>

7. Node 5 is the center of the following 3-star:
   - <5, (4, 6, 3)>

8. Node 8 is the center of the following 3-star:
   - <8, (7, 9, 3)>

9. Node 0 is the center of the following 3-star:
   - <0, (6, 9, 8)>

10. Node 2 is the center of the following 3-star:
    - <2, (4, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
