Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 8) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 15) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 6) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 1) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 15) (3, 16) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly 3 edges, which are potential leaves in 3-stars.
- Node 11 has edges with nodes 14, 1, and 8.
- Node 16 has edges with nodes 12, 3, and 8.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 7, 10, and 17.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 4, 6, and 15.
- Node 10 has edges with nodes 4, 17, and 13.
- Node 17 has edges with nodes 4, 10, and 3.
- Node 14 has edges with nodes 11, 0, and 13.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 18, 19, and 8.
- Node 13 has edges with nodes 10, 14, and 1.
- Node 19 has edges with nodes 5, 1, and 0.
- Node 15 has edges with nodes 7, 9, and 6.
- Node 12 has edges with nodes 16 and 3.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 7, 2, and 18.
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 16, 17, and 12.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 11, 16, and 5.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 14, 15, and 3.
- Nodes 0 and 2 have only 2 edges each and cannot be part of a 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (11, 14, 13)>
<3, (16, 12, 17)>
<5, (18, 8, 19)>
<7, (4, 10, 6)>
<11, (1, 13, 14)>
<15, (9, 14, 6)>
<16, (8, 11, 16)>
<19, (5, 1, 0)>

There are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
