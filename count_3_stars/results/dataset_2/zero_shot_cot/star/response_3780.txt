Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 14) (3, 22) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 28) (5, 21) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 23) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 2) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 23) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 2) (6, 2) (28, 15) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 0) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 10) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 7) (13, 26) (4, 3) (4, 12) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 11) (29, 21) (29, 9) (29, 11) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 14) (10, 25) (10, 26) (10, 7) (24, 17) (24, 0) (14, 21) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 7) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 24) (0, 11) (7, 15) (7, 22) (7, 10) (7, 18) (2, 20) (2, 23) (2, 6) (2, 16) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (leaves) connected to them. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars:
   - Node 21 has 5 neighbors (1, 16, 5, 29, 14)
   - Node 15 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 28)
   - Node 5 has 2 neighbors (21, 9)
   - Node 9 has 4 neighbors (5, 29, 0, 23)
   - Node 26 has 4 neighbors (8, 19, 13, 10)
   - Node 22 has 3 neighbors (3, 28, 7)
   - Node 12 has 3 neighbors (4, 14, 23)
   - Node 23 has 5 neighbors (9, 12, 8, 18, 2)
   - Node 28 has 3 neighbors (15, 22, 19)
   - Node 19 has 4 neighbors (28, 26, 14, 0)
   - Node 10 has 3 neighbors (25, 26, 7)
   - Node 14 has 5 neighbors (21, 12, 19, 16)
   - Node 18 has 3 neighbors (3, 23, 7)
   - Node 0 has 4 neighbors (9, 19, 24, 11)
   - Node 7 has 4 neighbors (15, 22, 10, 18)
   - Node 16 has 3 neighbors (21, 2, 14)
   - Node 11 has 4 neighbors (20, 17, 29, 0)

2. Form unique 3-stars using the identified central nodes and their neighbors:
   - <21, (1, 16, 5)>
   - <15, (1, 7, 28)>
   - <9, (5, 29, 0)>
   - <26, (8, 19, 13)>
   - <22, (3, 28, 7)>
   - <12, (4, 14, 23)>
   - <23, (9, 12, 8)>
   - <28, (15, 22, 19)>
   - <19, (28, 26, 14)>
   - <10, (25, 26, 7)>
   - <14, (21, 12, 19)>
   - <18, (3, 23, 7)>
   - <0, (9, 19, 24)>
   - <7, (15, 22, 10)>
   - <16, (21, 2, 14)>
   - <11, (20, 17, 29)>

Final answer: [16]
