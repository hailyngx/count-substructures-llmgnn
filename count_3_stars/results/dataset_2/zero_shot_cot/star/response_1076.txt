Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify potential 3-stars by looking at nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. These nodes are: 0, 2, and 5.

Upon closer inspection:
- Node 0 forms the 3-star <0, (7, 3, 5)>.
- Node 2 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 5 forms the 3-star <5, (1, 8, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
Unique 3-stars found: <<0, (7, 3, 5)>, <5, (1, 8, 0)>>.
