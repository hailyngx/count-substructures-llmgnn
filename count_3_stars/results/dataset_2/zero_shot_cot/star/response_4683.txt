Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 5) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, which are potential centers of 3-stars. Based on the given edges, the nodes with degree 3 are: 6, 9, 8, 13, 4, 7, 12, 0, 14, and 5. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 13 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 12 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 14 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (3, 8, 0)>
<8, (9, 13, 4)>
<13, (6, 8, 10)>
<4, (6, 9, 8)>
<7, (11, 3, 2)>
<12, (8, 0, 5)>
<0, (9, 8, 12)>
<14, (11, 1, 2)>
<5, (12, 3, 11)>
