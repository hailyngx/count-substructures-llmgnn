Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 2) (17, 11) (17, 0) (18, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 17) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 3) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 4) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

From the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 11, 16, 5, and 18.

Next, we need to identify the leaves connected to each center node to form 3-stars.

For node 11: (11, 1, 5), (11, 16, 17)
For node 16: (16, 13, 18), (16, 4, 11)
For node 5: (5, 11, 7)
For node 18: (18, 16, 13), (18, 6, 19)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
<11, (1, 5, 16)>, <11, (16, 17, 11)>, <16, (4, 11, 16)>, <5, (11, 7, 5)>, <18, (6, 13, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
