Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars:

1. Start by identifying nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be centers of 3-stars.
   
2. Looking at the edges provided, the node connections are:
   - Node 5: 6 connections
   - Node 9: 4 connections
   - Node 4: 3 connections
   - Node 8: 4 connections
   - Node 6: 4 connections
   - Node 2: 5 connections
   - Node 12: 5 connections
   - Node 1: 4 connections
   - Node 7: 3 connections
   - Node 11: 4 connections
   - Node 0: 4 connections
   - Node 3: 3 connections
   - Node 14: 3 connections
   - Node 10: 3 connections
   - Node 13: 6 connections

3. Nodes 5 and 13 have 6 connections, which means they are the potential centers of 3-stars. Let's analyze the 3-stars around these nodes.

4. For Node 5:
   - (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 11), (5, 0) - These connections form a 3-star with central node 5: <5, (9, 6, 2)>
   
5. For Node 13:
   - (13, 12), (13, 1), (13, 11), (13, 0), (13, 3), (13, 14) - These connections form a 3-star with central node 13: <13, (12, 1, 11)>
   
6. Counting the total number of 3-stars: [<5, (9, 6, 2)>, <13, (12, 1, 11)>] = [2]
