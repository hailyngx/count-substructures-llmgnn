Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 4) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 8) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 15) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 2) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 16) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 10 to form 3-stars.
The nodes connected to node 10 are 1, 17, and 18. 
So, the 3-stars formed around node 10 are <10, (1, 17, 18)>.

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 17 to form 3-stars.
The nodes connected to node 17 are 7, 9, and 18. 
So, the 3-stars formed around node 17 are <17, (7, 9, 18)>.

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars: 2
