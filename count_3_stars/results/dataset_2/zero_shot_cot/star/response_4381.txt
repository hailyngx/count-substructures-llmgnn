Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 26) (5, 26) (5, 24) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 17) (15, 12) (1, 18) (21, 8) (21, 22) (21, 14) (22, 21) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 7) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 10) (23, 27) (8, 21) (8, 13) (8, 29) (8, 27) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (10, 23) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 27) (26, 16) (26, 5) (26, 27) (28, 29) (28, 12) (29, 8) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 6) (0, 7) (0, 19) (0, 6) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 20) (7, 22) (7, 0) (20, 9) (20, 29) (20, 2) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 28) (12, 2) (6, 29) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 19) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 24) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 27) (18, 24) (27, 23) (27, 8) (27, 17) (27, 26) (27, 18) (19, 0) (19, 6) (25, 22) (25, 4) (24, 5) (24, 14) (24, 18) (4, 3) (4, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here is the list of unique 3-stars and the count of such occurrences:
