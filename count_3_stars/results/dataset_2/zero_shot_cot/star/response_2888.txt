Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 7) (11, 6) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's define the 3-stars present in the graph:

<6, (5, 9, 10)>
<9, (4, 8, 12)>
<1, (0, 3, 11)>
<4, (8, 9, 13)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 10)>
<7, (0, 2, 12)>
<12, (2, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<10, (3, 6, 12)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<14, (4, 7, 8)>
<11, (1, 6, 12)>
<13, (2, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
