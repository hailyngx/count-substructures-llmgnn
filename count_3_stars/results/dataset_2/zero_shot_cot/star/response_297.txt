Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 14) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 14) (8, 17) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 0) (19, 18) (19, 14) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 13) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 19) (10, 6) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting by listing all 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (7, 15, 18)>
<3, (9, 13, 17)>
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<6, (7, 10, 12)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
<10, (2, 6, 12)>
<12, (6, 16, 18)>
<13, (3, 11, 17)>
<14, (5, 15, 19)>
<16, (4, 12, 18)>
<17, (0, 4, 13)>
<18, (1, 7, 19)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [13]
