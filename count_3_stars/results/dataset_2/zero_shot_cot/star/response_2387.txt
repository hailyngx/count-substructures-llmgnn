Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 21) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 28) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 29) (17, 16) (17, 29) (17, 24) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 10) (22, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 20) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 15) (27, 3) (27, 14) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 25) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 15) (21, 11) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 2) (10, 1) (10, 29) (10, 19) (19, 10) (8, 5) (8, 25) (28, 5) (28, 2) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 28) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 6) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 24) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 12) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 26) (13, 23) (13, 25) (25, 29) (25, 14) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 13) (6, 11) (6, 20) (6, 12) (12, 0) (12, 23) (12, 6) (24, 17) (24, 4) (24, 18) 

Response:
The first step to count the number of 3-stars in the graph is to identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with 3 neighbors.

Let's list the nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 11 has neighbors 16, 7, and 21.
- Node 16 has neighbors 11, 21, and 17.
- Node 5 has neighbors 8, 18, and 28.
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 27, and 18.
- Node 17 has neighbors 16, 29, and 24.
- Node 29 has neighbors 3, 17, and 25.
- Node 14 has neighbors 22, 4, and 27.
- Node 26 has neighbors 14, 2, and 20.
- Node 21 has neighbors 11, 16, and 25.
- Node 10 has neighbors 1, 29, and 19.
- Node 8 has neighbors 5, 25, and unknown (not explicitly mentioned).
- Node 28 has neighbors 5, 2, and unknown (not explicitly mentioned).
- Node 2 has neighbors 26, 21, and 28.
- Node 20 has neighbors 7, 26, and 6.
- Node 18 has neighbors 5, 3, and 24.
- Node 23 has neighbors 9, 18, and 13.
- Node 15 has neighbors 16, 4, and 26.
- Node 25 has neighbors 29, 14, and 21.
- Node 6 has neighbors 11, 20, and 12.
- Node 12 has neighbors 0, 23, and 6.
- Node 24 has neighbors 17, 4, and 18.

Based on the nodes with 3 neighbors, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <11, (16, 7, 21)>
- <16, (11, 21, 17)>
- <5, (8, 18, 28)>
- <3, (1, 27, 18)>
- <17, (16, 29, 24)>
- <29, (3, 17, 25)>
- <14, (22, 4, 27)>
- <26, (14, 2, 20)>
- <21, (11, 16, 25)>
- <10, (1, 29, 19)>
- <8, (5, 25, unknown)>
- <28, (5, 2, unknown)>
- <2, (26, 21, 28)>
- <20, (7, 26, 6)>
- <18, (5, 3, 24)>
- <23, (9, 18, 13)>
- <15, (16, 4, 26)>
- <25, (29, 14, 21)>
- <6, (11, 20, 12)>
- <12, (0, 23, 6)>
- <24, (17, 4, 18)>

There are a total of [20] unique 3-stars in the graph.
