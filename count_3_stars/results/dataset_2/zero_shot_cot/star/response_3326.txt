Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 23) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 3) (8, 4) (13, 15) (13, 27) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 6) (22, 24) (23, 9) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 1) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 27) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 20) (4, 6) (4, 15) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 9) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 14) (29, 1) (29, 5) (21, 12) (21, 19) (2, 22) (2, 27) (12, 21) (12, 11) (12, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 20) (11, 25) (14, 16) (14, 28) (14, 11) (1, 23) (1, 29) (6, 22) (6, 4) (6, 25) (3, 26) (3, 10) (3, 28) (3, 12) (5, 29) (5, 0) (15, 26) (15, 13) (15, 23) (15, 4) (20, 4) (20, 11) (20, 18) (25, 11) (25, 6) (25, 24) (24, 22) (24, 25) (18, 10) (18, 20) (18, 27) (18, 0) (27, 13) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 18) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 9 is the center with leaves 26, 28, and 23. <9, (26, 28, 23)>
2. Node 26 is the center with leaves 9, 15, and 3. <26, (9, 15, 3)>
3. Node 28 is the center with leaves 9, 16, and 14. <28, (9, 16, 14)>
4. Node 23 is the center with leaves 9, 22, and 15. <23, (9, 22, 15)>
5. Node 10 is the center with leaves 17, 3, and 18. <10, (17, 3, 18)>
6. Node 17 is the center with leaves 10, 19, and 27. <17, (10, 19, 27)>
7. Node 4 is the center with leaves 8, 20, and 6. <4, (8, 20, 6)>
8. Node 22 is the center with leaves 23, 2, and 24. <22, (23, 2, 24)>
9. Node 15 is the center with leaves 26, 13, and 4. <15, (26, 13, 4)>
10. Node 11 is the center with leaves 12, 14, and 20. <11, (12, 14, 20)>
11. Node 6 is the center with leaves 22, 4, and 25. <6, (22, 4, 25)>
12. Node 3 is the center with leaves 26, 10, and 28. <3, (26, 10, 28)>
13. Node 27 is the center with leaves 13, 17, and 2. <27, (13, 17, 2)>
14. Node 1 is the center with leaves 23, 29, and 0. <1, (23, 29, 0)>
15. Node 5 is the center with leaves 29, 0, and 25. <5, (29, 0, 25)>
16. Node 20 is the center with leaves 4, 11, and 18. <20, (4, 11, 18)>
17. Node 25 is the center with leaves 11, 6, and 24. <25, (11, 6, 24)>
18. Node 12 is the center with leaves 21, 11, and 3. <12, (21, 11, 3)>
19. Node 18 is the center with leaves 10, 20, and 27. <18, (10, 20, 27)>
20. Node 19 is the center with leaves 17, 21, and 0. <19, (17, 21, 0)>

Therefore, there are 20 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [20].
