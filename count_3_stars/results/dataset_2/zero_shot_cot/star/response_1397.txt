Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (4, 6) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (13, 11) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 19) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. First, let's list all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 14, and 17.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 16.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 16, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 12, and 16.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 19, and 17.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 19.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 13, and 0.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 18.

2. Next, for each of the identified nodes above, let's check if the connections form a 3-star by checking that:
- The central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- The three other nodes are not connected to each other.
- The three other nodes are not the central node of any other 3-star.

3. By following the above criteria, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
- <1, (5, 3, 19)>
- <2, (18, 14, 17)>
- <3, (1, 14, 16)>
- <4, (6, 16, 0)>
- <7, (6, 12, 16)>
- <8, (9, 19, 17)>
- <10, (8, 12, 19)>
- <11, (5, 13, 0)>
- <16, (3, 4, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
