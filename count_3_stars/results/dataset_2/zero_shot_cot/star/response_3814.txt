Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the connected leaves for each 3-star. 

Looking at the edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (4, 9, 13)>
<1, (4, 6, 11)>
<2, (4, 5, 12)>
<3, (0, 9, 13)>
<4, (0, 1, 11)>
<5, (2, 6, 12)>
<6, (1, 5, 14)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (10, 11, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>
<10, (0, 8, 3)>
<11, (1, 4, 12)>
<12, (2, 12, 14)>
<13, (0, 3, 9)>
<14, (5, 12, 6)>

There are a total of 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [14].
