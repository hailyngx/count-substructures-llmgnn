Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 13: <5, (9, 4, 13)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 7: <9, (5, 2, 7)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 1: <4, (5, 10, 1)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 2: <7, (9, 6, 2)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 3: <6, (7, 1, 3)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 14: <13, (5, 8, 14)>
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 11: <0, (13, 14, 11)>
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 13: <14, (5, 8, 13)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8: <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 13: <2, (9, 7, 13)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 3: <10, (4, 8, 3)>
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 14: <12, (5, 6, 14)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have counted 12 3-stars. 
So, the final answer is: [12].
