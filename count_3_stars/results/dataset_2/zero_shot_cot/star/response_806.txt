Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges, as these nodes have the potential to serve as the centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are nodes 0, 3, and 5. 

Next, let's examine each potential center node to see if they can form 3-stars. 

1. Node 0: Although node 0 has exactly three neighbors (1, 8, and 9), these neighbors are not connected to each other, so node 0 cannot form a 3-star.

2. Node 3: Node 3 has only one neighbor, which is not enough to form a 3-star.

3. Node 5: Node 5 has two neighbors, nodes 4 and 6. These two neighbors are not connected to each other, so node 5 cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph.
