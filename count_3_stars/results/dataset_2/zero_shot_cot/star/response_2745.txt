Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

Let's start by listing the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

- Central node 0 -> Leaves: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Central node 1 -> Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Central node 2 -> Leaves: 3, 4, 7, 9
- Central node 3 -> Leaves: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
- Central node 4 -> Leaves: 2, 6, 9
- Central node 5 -> Leaves: 7, 8
- Central node 6 -> Leaves: 4, 7
- Central node 7 -> Leaves: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Central node 8 -> Leaves: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9
- Central node 9 -> Leaves: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
