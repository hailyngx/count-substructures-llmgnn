Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (9, 8, 5)>
2. <3, (1, 7, 5)>
3. <4, (3, 7, 8)>
4. <5, (6, 1, 3)>
5. <7, (6, 9, 4)>
6. <8, (9, 1, 4)>
7. <9, (6, 8, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
