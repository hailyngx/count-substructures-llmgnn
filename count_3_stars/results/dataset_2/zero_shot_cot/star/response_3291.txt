Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 21) (6, 24) (6, 18) (6, 27) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 28) (25, 2) (20, 7) (20, 19) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 8) (2, 25) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 29) (7, 20) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (29, 18) (22, 3) (22, 21) (22, 8) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (13, 5) (13, 24) (13, 14) (13, 27) (4, 12) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 11) (27, 6) (27, 13) (27, 4) (1, 10) (1, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 23) (28, 25) (28, 17) (28, 16) (21, 26) (21, 22) (24, 6) (24, 13) (24, 4) (24, 14) (0, 2) (0, 23) (19, 20) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 23) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 22) (11, 5) (11, 4) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes for each 3-star in the graph. A central node must have exactly three neighbors. 

From the given edges, we can see that the nodes with three neighbors are: 
- Node 8 (neighbors: 10, 7, 12)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 15, 28, 23)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 7, 13, 24)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 12, 27, 11)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 18, 7, 13)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 9, 25, 10)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 9, 15, 21)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 25, 18, 0)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 8: (10, 1, 17), (7, 14, 5), (12, 4, 27), (22, 3, 21) [4]
- Node 16: (15, 26, 23), (28, 17, 16) [2]
- Node 14: (7, 8, 13), (24, 23, 4), (14, 7, 13) [3]
- Node 4: (12, 27, 14), (13, 5, 11), (24, 6, 14) [3]
- Node 5: (18, 29, 2), (7, 11, 13), (18, 6, 24) [3]
- Node 3: (10, 22, 21), (25, 2, 28), (9, 26, 15) [3]
- Node 26: (9, 3, 21), (26, 15, 21) [2]
- Node 2: (25, 0, 23), (25, 18, 0) [2]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19]. 
The unique 3-stars are <8, (10, 1, 17)>, <8, (7, 14, 5)>, <8, (12, 4, 27)>, <8, (22, 3, 21)>, <16, (15, 26, 23)>, <16, (28, 17, 16)>, <14, (7, 8, 13)>, <14, (24, 23, 4)>, <14, (14, 7, 13)>, <4, (12, 27, 14)>, <4, (13, 5, 11)>, <4, (24, 6, 14)>, <5, (18, 29, 2)>, <5, (7, 11, 13)>, <5, (18, 6, 24)>, <3, (10, 22, 21)>, <3, (25, 2, 28)>, <3, (9, 26, 15)>, <26, (9, 3, 21)>, <26, (26, 15, 21)>.
