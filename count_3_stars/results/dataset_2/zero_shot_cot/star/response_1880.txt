Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 14) (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 18) (2, 29) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 24) (7, 16) (7, 22) (7, 8) (21, 0) (21, 5) (21, 4) (6, 25) (6, 0) (9, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 6) (0, 20) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 13) (1, 24) (26, 29) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 29) (17, 28) (3, 11) (4, 27) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 25) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 23) (12, 29) (12, 18) (23, 16) (23, 26) (23, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 22) (22, 7) (22, 14) (22, 24) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 13) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 12) (10, 13) (5, 21) (5, 4) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 8) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 1) (24, 22) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list out all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 6, 20)>
<2, (0, 24, 28)>
<4, (5, 19, 21)>
<7, (8, 16, 22)>
<8, (7, 11, 19)>
<11, (8, 14, 16)>
<13, (10, 20, 28)>
<14, (11, 15, 22)>
<15, (14, 18, 27)>
<16, (7, 11, 23)>
<18, (12, 15, 27)>
<19, (4, 8, 23)>
<20, (0, 9, 13)>
<21, (4, 5, 0)>
<22, (7, 14, 24)>
<23, (16, 19, 26)>
<24, (2, 1, 22)>
<25, (6, 8, 26)>
<26, (23, 25, 29)>
<27, (15, 18, 4)>
<28, (2, 13, 17)>
<29, (26, 12, 17)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by calculating the number of unique 3-stars found:
