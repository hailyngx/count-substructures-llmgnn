Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 22) (15, 25) (15, 24) (6, 9) (6, 26) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 20) (7, 21) (7, 25) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 29) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 5) (12, 10) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 17) (19, 8) (19, 20) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 5) (26, 2) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 4) (17, 27) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 27) (4, 1) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 0) (25, 15) (25, 7) (16, 29) (16, 23) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 14) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 24) (22, 3) (22, 4) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 0) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 8) (14, 28) (14, 8) (14, 2) (29, 10) (29, 16) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (18, 12) (18, 13) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 2) (20, 23) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (6, 9, 20)>
<9, (3, 6, 20)>
<15, (24, 25, 7)>
<21, (7, 26, 11)>
<10, (12, 11, 29)>
<11, (5, 10, 21)>
<12, (18, 27, 10)>
<27, (17, 4, 12)>
<8, (19, 28, 14)>
<29, (16, 10, 23)>
<13, (0, 18, 4)>
<2, (5, 14, 20)>
<0, (13, 2, 17)>
<18, (13, 12, 27)>
<20, (2, 23, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
