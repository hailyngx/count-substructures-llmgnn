Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 28) (9, 24) (20, 25) (20, 13) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 11) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 13) (4, 28) (4, 18) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 27) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 10) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 7) (22, 21) (1, 2) (17, 5) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 15) (3, 21) (3, 23) (11, 25) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 12) (21, 22) (21, 3) (21, 11) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 2) (26, 16) (10, 14) (10, 23) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 27) (2, 15) (7, 22) (7, 16) (7, 27) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 6) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 3) (23, 10) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 15) (12, 11) (8, 15) (19, 29) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 17) (27, 18) (27, 2) (27, 7) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 17, 23)>
<9, (5, 18, 28)>
<20, (25, 13, -)>
<25, (20, 15, 11)>
<28, (9, 4, 29)>
<4, (28, 18, -)>
<18, (9, 4, 27)>
<0, (14, 19, -)>
<14, (0, 19, 10)>
<22, (9, 2, 7)>
<1, (2, -, -)>
<17, (5, 23, 19)>
<3, (21, 23, -)>
<11, (25, 26, 21)>
<21, (22, 3, 11)>
<26, (25, 11, 2)>
<10, (14, 23, -)>
<2, (22, 1, 26)>
<7, (22, 16, 27)>
<16, (26, 7, 6)>
<6, (16, 24, -)>
<24, (9, 6, -)>
<13, (20, 15, 29)>
<12, (11, -, -)>
<8, (15, -, -)>

Therefore, there are [24] 3-stars in the given graph.
