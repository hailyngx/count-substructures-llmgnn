Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 14) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 19) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (19, 0) (19, 2) (12, 18) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 7) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 11) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify unique 3-stars where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <0, (11, 13, 19)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 15)>
3. <2, (8, 19, 2)>
4. <3, (4, 13, 16)>
5. <5, (6, 9, 10)>
6. <8, (2, 14, 8)>
7. <9, (5, 13, 16)>
8. <10, (0, 15, 16)>
9. <11, (0, 7, 14)>
10. <14, (8, 11, 17)>
11. <15, (1, 6, 17)>
12. <17, (11, 15, 18)>
13. <18, (4, 7, 12)>

There are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
