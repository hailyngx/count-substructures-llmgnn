Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 1) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 15) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 9) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to find nodes that are connected to three other nodes, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars. Since each 3-star has exactly one central node and three leaves, we will look for nodes with degree 3.

From the given list of edges, we can determine the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 11 has degree 3
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 1
- Node 14 has degree 4
- Node 15 has degree 3
- Node 16 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 5

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (4, 6, 9)>
2. <1, (4, 7, 10)>
3. <4, (0, 1, 6)>
4. <5, (3, 14, 16)>
5. <8, (4, 15, 14)>
6. <9, (0, 15, 18)>
7. <11, (16, 15, 3)>
8. <12, (7, 17, 18)>
9. <15, (11, 8, 9)>
10. <16, (11, 1, 5)>
11. <17, (10, 12, 18)>
12. <18, (9, 17, 12)>
13. <19, (0, 6, 10)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [13]
