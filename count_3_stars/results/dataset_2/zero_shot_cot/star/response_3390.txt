Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 22) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 24) (20, 21) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 13) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 18) (8, 21) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 18) (13, 20) (13, 8) (13, 9) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 1) (29, 28) (29, 23) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 5) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 26) (5, 2) (5, 28) (11, 20) (11, 23) (11, 19) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 17) (23, 27) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 10) (27, 26) (27, 19) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 10) (1, 2) (1, 6) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (18, 25) (18, 8) (18, 28) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 16) (17, 23) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 27) (19, 10) (19, 12) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 16) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 14) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 24) (0, 8) (0, 24) (24, 21) (24, 12) (24, 0) (24, 14) (10, 27) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 19) (14, 16) (14, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<20, (12, 13, 11)>
<27, (10, 26, 25)>
<28, (6, 5, 18)>
<5, (2, 28, 6)>
<2, (22, 5, 1)>
<23, (29, 11, 17)>
<12, (20, 17, 24)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
