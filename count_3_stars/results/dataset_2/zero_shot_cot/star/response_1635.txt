Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-star graphs. 

Nodes with 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars.
