Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by finding the number of nodes that can be the central node and then considering the number of possibilities for the leaves of each central node. 

Let's start by listing all the possibilities for the 3-stars by examining each node as a potential central node:

1. For node 0: (0, 5, 9), (0, 2, 6), (0, 3, 4)
2. For node 1: (1, 4, 7)
3. For node 2: (2, 0, 6), (2, 3, 4), (2, 7, 6)
4. For node 3: (3, 0, 9), (3, 2, 4), (3, 8, 4)
5. For node 4: (4, 1, 7), (4, 0, 5), (4, 2, 7), (4, 3, 8)
6. For node 5: (5, 0, 8)
7. For node 6: (6, 0, 9), (6, 2, 7)
8. For node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 2, 6)
9. For node 8: (8, 3, 5)
10. For node 9: (9, 3, 6), (9, 0, 5)

So, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [13]. 

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (5, 9, 0)>, <0, (2, 6, 0)>, <0, (3, 4, 0)>, <1, (4, 7, 1)>, <2, (0, 6, 2)>, <2, (3, 4, 2)>, <2, (7, 6, 2)>, <3, (0, 9, 3)>, <3, (2, 4, 3)>, <3, (8, 4, 3)>, <4, (1, 7, 4)>, <4, (0, 5, 4)>, <4, (2, 7, 4)>
