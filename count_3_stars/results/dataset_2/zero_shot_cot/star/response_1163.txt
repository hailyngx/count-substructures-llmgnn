Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 2, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 1, -)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<6, (8, 7, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (8, 6, 0)>
<2, (9, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 0)>
<2, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (6, 7, -)>

As we can see, there are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [13].
