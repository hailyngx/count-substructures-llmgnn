Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (0, 13) (0, 5) 

Response:
Given the provided graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we can identify the unique 3-stars as follows:

<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 11)>
<1, (3, 9, 12)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 10, 12)>
<13, (0, 1, 11)>
<5, (0, 8, 12)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (7, 10, 12)>
<11, (3, 7, 13)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<12, (1, 10, 14)>
<14, (5, 10, 11)>
<10, (2, 8, 12)>
<0, (5, 13, 14)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars identified, we can determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [15].
