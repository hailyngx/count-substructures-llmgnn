Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 20) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 3) (2, 24) (2, 14) (29, 7) (29, 24) (14, 2) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 27) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 1) (27, 17) (27, 12) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 25) (8, 26) (18, 26) (18, 28) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 24) (23, 5) (23, 7) (23, 10) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 23) (10, 7) (26, 8) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 16) (0, 28) (0, 7) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 15) (3, 22) (3, 21) (3, 19) (21, 6) (21, 3) (21, 19) (11, 5) (11, 25) (19, 3) (19, 21) (19, 25) (19, 16) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 20) (1, 12) (1, 20) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 23) (5, 11) (9, 13) (9, 25) (9, 20) (25, 4) (25, 11) (25, 19) (25, 9) (25, 15) (20, 13) (20, 16) (20, 1) (20, 9) (15, 7) (15, 25) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to only three other nodes, which would make them the center of a 3-star. 

The nodes satisfying this condition are: 
- Node 13
- Node 22
- Node 2
- Node 29
- Node 17
- Node 12
- Node 4
- Node 8
- Node 18
- Node 6
- Node 23
- Node 10
- Node 26
- Node 0
- Node 3
- Node 21
- Node 11
- Node 19
- Node 1
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 25
- Node 20
- Node 15
- Node 24

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the center nodes.

<13, (22, 20, 9)>
<22, (13, 10, 3)>
<2, (24, 14, 29)>
<29, (7, 24, 2)>
<17, (10, 5, 27)>
<12, (27, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 16, 25)>
<8, (26, 18, 0)>
<18, (26, 28, 6)>
<6, (12, 28, 21)>
<23, (5, 7, 10)>
<10, (22, 17, 23)>
<26, (8, 18, 28)>
<0, (28, 7, 24)>
<3, (22, 21, 19)>
<21, (6, 3, 19)>
<11, (5, 25, 16)>
<19, (3, 21, 25)>
<1, (12, 20, 6)>
<5, (17, 4, 23)>
<9, (13, 25, 20)>
<25, (4, 11, 19)>
<20, (13, 16, 1)>
<15, (7, 25, 0)>
<24, (2, 29, 28)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
