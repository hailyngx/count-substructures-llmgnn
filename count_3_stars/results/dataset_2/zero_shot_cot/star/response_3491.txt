Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 24) (2, 28) (29, 5) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 6) (0, 25) (0, 28) (20, 22) (20, 23) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 12) (26, 19) (22, 20) (22, 19) (22, 4) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 14) (21, 6) (21, 14) (21, 24) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 16) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 27) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (7, 3) (7, 28) (7, 18) (7, 1) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 23) (5, 12) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 15) (14, 6) (14, 21) (14, 27) (1, 25) (1, 7) (1, 24) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 24) (10, 3) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 11) (24, 2) (24, 21) (24, 1) (24, 15) (11, 8) (11, 15) (11, 12) (18, 25) (18, 16) (18, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected in a 3-star configuration. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (25, 28, 1)>
<1, (25, 24, 7)>
<2, (24, 28, 1)>
<4, (22, 27, 13)>
<5, (27, 23, 12)>
<6, (21, 14, 27)>
<8, (16, 9, 13)>
<9, (16, 15, 8)>
<11, (12, 15, 11)>
<13, (17, 4, 8)>
<15, (23, 24, 12)>
<18, (7, 25, 16)>
<19, (12, 22, 26)>
<20, (22, 23, 19)>
<21, (24, 14, 6)>
<22, (20, 19, 4)>
<23, (5, 15, 20)>
<24, (1, 21, 2)>
<25, (0, 18, 1)>
<26, (19, 22, 27)>
<27, (17, 14, 5)>
<28, (0, 7, 2)>
<29, (5, 23, 12)>

Next, we count the number of unique 3-stars identified above.
