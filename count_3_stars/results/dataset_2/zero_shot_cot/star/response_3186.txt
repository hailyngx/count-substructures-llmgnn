Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 14) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 29) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 17) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 17) (4, 9) (4, 23) (4, 14) (20, 15) (20, 0) (20, 3) (28, 17) (28, 25) (29, 13) (29, 27) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 23) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 0) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 16) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 19) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 10) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 2) (26, 23) (11, 24) (11, 9) (11, 5) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 2) (24, 25) (2, 23) (2, 24) (2, 6) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 12) (25, 28) (25, 24) (17, 21) (17, 18) (17, 28) (17, 19) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 19) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars present in the graph:

<13, (22, 29, 7)>
<22, (13, 18, 14)>
<15, (20, 0, 18)>
<21, (1, 3, 17)>
<18, (22, 15, 5)>
<4, (9, 23, 14)>
<20, (15, 0, 3)>
<28, (17, 25, 25)>
<29, (13, 27, 27)>
<0, (13, 15, 20)>
<14, (22, 4, 0)>
<3, (21, 20, 16)>
<16, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (13, 16, 10)>
<23, (4, 0, 26)>
<11, (24, 9, 5)>
<24, (11, 9, 5)>
<2, (23, 24, 6)>
<9, (4, 16, 11)>
<25, (28, 24, 25)>
<17, (21, 18, 28)>
<5, (18, 11, 24)>
<12, (9, 5, 10)>
<6, (2, 10, 19)>
<10, (7, 12, 6)>
<19, (16, 17, 6)>

Now, to find the total number of 3-stars, we count the unique 3-stars listed above. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
