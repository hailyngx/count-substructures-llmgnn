Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph, and the count is [11].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (9, 5, 1)>
<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 6, 6)>
<2, (5, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 4, 0)>
<7, (0, 6, 0)>
