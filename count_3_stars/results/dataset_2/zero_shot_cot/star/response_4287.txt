Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 18) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (16, 2) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 3) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 18) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 18) (14, 8) (14, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 19) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 2) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected in a 3-star pattern. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can first identify all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

The nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are: 4, 12, 1, 13, 19, 16, 2, and 14. 

Next, we look for 3-stars formed by each of these nodes. To identify the unique 3-stars, we can represent them as follows:
- From node 4: <4, (7, 9, 13)>
- From node 12: <12, (7, 5, 0)>
- From node 1: <1, (17, 11, 18)>
- From node 13: <13, (4, 7, 17)>
- From node 19: <19, (10, 3, 6)>
- From node 16: <16, (2, 5, 0)>
- From node 2: <2, (16, 5, 9)>
- From node 14: <14, (8, 3, *)> (One leaf node not determined)

Counting the total number of 3-stars identified: [8]
