Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected in the graph:
Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 11, and 12.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 10.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 8, 10, and 13.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 11, and 12.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 9, 12, and 14.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 9, and 13.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 14.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 12.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 11, 14.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 10, 14.
Node 11 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 9, 11, 14.
Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 5.
Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9, 10, 11.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <5, (2, 9, 13)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 14)>
3. <4, (3, 7, 12)>
4. <7, (1, 4, 8)>
5. <6, (9, 10, 14)>
6. <12, (3, 8, 4)>
7. <2, (3, 5, 8)>
8. <8, (1, 2, 12)>
9. <0, (5, 8, 12)>
10. <14, (6, 9, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
