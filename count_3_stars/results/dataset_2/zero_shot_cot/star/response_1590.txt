Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 16) (4, 15) (4, 16) (4, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 9) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 5) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 19.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 15, and 17.

2. Count the number of 3-stars based on the identified nodes:
- For Node 5: <5, (2, 8, 12)>
- For Node 7: <7, (0, 3, 14)>
- For Node 9: <9, (4, 12, 19)>
- For Node 13: <13, (5, 15, 17)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
