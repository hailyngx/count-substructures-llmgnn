Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (10, 9) (10, 12) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Nodes with exactly 3 edges are potential central nodes for 3-stars. 
The potential central nodes are: 
- Node 6 (degree 5)
- Node 9 (degree 5)
- Node 5 (degree 6)
- Node 0 (degree 4)
- Node 14 (degree 4)
- Node 4 (degree 3)
- Node 12 (degree 3)
- Node 1 (degree 5)
- Node 10 (degree 3)
- Node 3 (degree 3)
- Node 7 (degree 5)
- Node 2 (degree 4)
- Node 8 (degree 4)
- Node 13 (degree 4)
- Node 11 (degree 2)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (6, 7, 1)>
<9, (6, 13, 1)>
<6, (5, 1, 11)>
<0, (9, 8, 14)>
<14, (5, 13, 7)>
<4, (5, 12, 1)>
<12, (5, 10, 4)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<10, (9, 12, 2)>
<3, (5, 2, 8)>
<7, (6, 5, 13)>
<2, (9, 3, 13)>
<8, (0, 3, 14)>
<13, (9, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
