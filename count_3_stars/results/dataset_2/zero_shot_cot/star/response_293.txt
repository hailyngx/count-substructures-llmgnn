Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 15) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 15) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 16) (15, 12) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 19) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the nodes with 3 edges connected to them.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars:
<4, (7, 8, 10)>
<7, (4, 12, 11)>
<8, (4, 9, 12)>
<12, (7, 8, 0)>
<0, (12, 14, 16)>
<14, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (14, 5, 16)>
<16, (0, 6, 1)>
<18, (12, 19, 3)>
<3, (2, 9, 10)>
<11, (7, 0, 1)>
<13, (5, 15, 13)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>
<15, (12, 13, 15)>
<9, (8, 14, 3)>
<2, (16, 3, 2)>
<19, (7, 18, 9)>
<10, (4, 3, 10)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get 17 3-stars in total. 
So, the answer is [17].
