Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes forming 3-stars.

Nodes with their connections:  
0: 9, 8, 3, 2  
1: 9, 4, 2  
2: 9, 7, 6, 0, 1  
3: 5, 9, 6, 0  
4: 5, 7, 8, 1  
5: 6, 4, 3  
6: 5, 7, 8, 3, 2  
7: 4, 6, 8, 2  
8: 4, 7, 0, 6  
9: 2, 3, 1, 0  

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph:  
<4, (5, 7, 8)>  
<6, (5, 7, 8)>  
<0, (9, 8, 4)>  
<2, (9, 7, 6)>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
