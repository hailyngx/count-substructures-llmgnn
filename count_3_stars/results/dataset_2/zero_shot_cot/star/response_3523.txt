Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (15, 8) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (14, 11) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 11
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 17
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 18, and 17
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 14
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 0
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 8, 5, and 5

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (9, 7, 11)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 13, 17)>
<6, (9, 10, 0)>
<9, (6, 18, 17)>
<16, (9, 12, 14)>
<17, (9, 4, 7)>
<18, (9, 8, 0)>
<19, (8, 5, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
