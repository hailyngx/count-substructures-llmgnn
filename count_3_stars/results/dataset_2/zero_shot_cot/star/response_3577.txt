Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 14) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, we need to find nodes that have a degree of 3.

Let's first list all nodes that have a degree of 3:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 13, 0, and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 4, and 12.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 7, and 11.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 10.

From the above information, we can see that there are no 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the output is simply [0].
