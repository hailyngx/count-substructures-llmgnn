Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 20) (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 8) (22, 26) (22, 7) (7, 22) (7, 0) (20, 21) (20, 25) (20, 23) (25, 1) (25, 20) (25, 23) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 6) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 23) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 29) (19, 1) (26, 18) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 6) (24, 26) (24, 0) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 2) (15, 17) (15, 5) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 23) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 27) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 12) (6, 26) (29, 4) (29, 16) (29, 8) (28, 17) (16, 27) (16, 29) (8, 18) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 29) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 27) (23, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree 3) to form the 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 21, and 25 are connected to 1; nodes 14, 17, and 13 are connected to 14; nodes 18, 22, and 26 are connected to 18; nodes 3, 11, and 8 are connected to 3; nodes 5 and 0 are connected to 5; nodes 12 and 6 are connected to 12; nodes 27 and 23 are connected to 27; nodes 29 and 16 are connected to 29.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
We will consider each set of 3 nodes connected to a center node to check if they form a 3-star.

The possible 3-stars are:
<1, (21, 25, 12)>
<14, (17, 13, 27)>
<18, (22, 26, 6)>
<3, (11, 8, 0)>
<5, (15, 0)>
<21, (20, 1)>
<17, (10, 28)>
<4, (9, 29)>
<25, (20, 23)>
<10, (8, 9)>
<12, (2, 6)>
<27, (23, 13)>
<29, (16, 8)>

Thus, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
