Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 0) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Analyzing the given edges, we find the following unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (5, 10, 11)>
2. <2, (6, 8, 13)>
3. <4, (6, 7, 8)>
4. <7, (4, 5, 14)>
5. <9, (6, 10, 12)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
