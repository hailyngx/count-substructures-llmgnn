Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their degrees based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 6
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 2

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (6, 4, 1)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (6, 5, 8)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
