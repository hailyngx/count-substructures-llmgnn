Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-star structures present in the graph:

- <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (4, 8, 1)>
- <1, (4, 3, 2)>
- <3, (1, 9, 0)>
- <6, (5, 8, _)> (the fourth node is missing)
- <9, (4, 3, 8)>
- <8, (4, 7, 1)>
- <5, (1, 6, 2)>
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (4, 1, 3)>

Based on the provided edges, there are 10 unique 3-stars present in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
