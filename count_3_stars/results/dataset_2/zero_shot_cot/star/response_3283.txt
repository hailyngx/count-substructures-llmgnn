Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 7, forming a 3-star <0, (6, 1, 7)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 2, forming a 3-star <1, (9, 6, 2)>.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 4, forming a 3-star <2, (9, 1, 4)>.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 0, forming a 3-star <3, (5, 7, 0)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8, forming a 3-star <4, (5, 6, 8)>.
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 0, forming a 3-star <7, (5, 3, 0)>.
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2, forming a 3-star <9, (5, 6, 2)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (6, 1, 7)>, <1, (9, 6, 2)>, <2, (9, 1, 4)>, <3, (5, 7, 0)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <7, (5, 3, 0)>, and <9, (5, 6, 2)>.
