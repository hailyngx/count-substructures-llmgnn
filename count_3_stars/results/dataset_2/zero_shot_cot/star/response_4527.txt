Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 3) 

Response:
In order to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all possible 3-stars by looking for central nodes with exactly 3 leaves. Then we will count the occurrences of each unique 3-star.

First, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 12, 14)>
<9, (5, 6, 11)>
<6, (9, 1, 10)>
<10, (6, 8, 11)>
<11, (9, 10, 7)>
<8, (10, 13, 2)>
<13, (8, 3, 1)>
<2, (9, 8, 12)>
<4, (10, 11, 14)>
<12, (5, 2, 0)>
<1, (6, 13, 4)>
<7, (11, 1, 3)>
<0, (12, 2, 3)>
<3, (8, 13, 7)>
<14, (5, 4, 3)>

Now, let's count the occurrences of each unique 3-star:

<5, (9, 12, 14)>: 1
<9, (5, 6, 11)>: 1
<6, (9, 1, 10)>: 1
<10, (6, 8, 11)>: 1
<11, (9, 10, 7)>: 1
<8, (10, 13, 2)>: 1
<13, (8, 3, 1)>: 1
<2, (9, 8, 12)>: 1
<4, (10, 11, 14)>: 1
<12, (5, 2, 0)>: 1
<1, (6, 13, 4)>: 1
<7, (11, 1, 3)>: 1
<0, (12, 2, 3)>: 1
<3, (8, 13, 7)>: 1
<14, (5, 4, 3)>: 1

Therefore, there are [15] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
