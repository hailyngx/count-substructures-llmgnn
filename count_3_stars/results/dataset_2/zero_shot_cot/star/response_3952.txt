Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 28) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (5, 27) (6, 19) (6, 20) (6, 16) (0, 2) (0, 23) (0, 19) (2, 0) (2, 23) (2, 24) (14, 22) (14, 12) (11, 8) (26, 10) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 19) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 18) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 27) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 24) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 18) (22, 4) (22, 14) (23, 5) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 27) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 8) (29, 5) (29, 7) (9, 15) (9, 27) (20, 6) (20, 21) (20, 16) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 18) (24, 21) (21, 4) (21, 20) (21, 24) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 20) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 23) (27, 9) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 15) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star structure.

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 1: <4, (8, 13, 1)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 24, and 29: <8, (4, 24, 29)>
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 6, 0, and 28: <19, (6, 0, 28)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 26, 1, and 15: <10, (26, 1, 15)>
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 27, 18, and 19: <17, (27, 18, 19)>
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 18: <16, (6, 1, 18)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 23, and 24: <2, (0, 23, 24)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 23, 29, and 27: <5, (23, 29, 27)>
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 26, and 15: <12, (14, 26, 15)>
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 4, 20, and 24: <21, (4, 20, 24)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 13, 29, and 7: <7, (13, 29, 7)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 15, 27, and 9: <9, (15, 27, 9)>
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 17, 27, and 16: <18, (17, 27, 16)>
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 3, 19, and 28: <28, (3, 19, 28)>

Now, we have found 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].
