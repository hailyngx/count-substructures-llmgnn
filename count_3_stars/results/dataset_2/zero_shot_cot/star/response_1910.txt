Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 4.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 7.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 5, 0, 7, 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 3.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 8, 1, 3.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 0.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 8, 0, 3, 1.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 3.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 7, 0.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:

<0, (6, 9, 4)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>
<0, (9, 4, 3)>
<0, (4, 5, 3)>
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<1, (9, 5, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (9, 3, 4)>
<3, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (8, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
<4, (0, 5, 3)>
<5, (6, 8, 7)>
<6, (5, 7, 0)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<9, (1, 7, 0)>

Therefore, there are [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
