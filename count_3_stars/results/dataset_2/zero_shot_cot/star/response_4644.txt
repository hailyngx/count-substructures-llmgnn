Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 3) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 27) (21, 2) (21, 17) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 3) (19, 29) (19, 28) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 0) (26, 12) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 5) (28, 19) (28, 26) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 17) (0, 22) (0, 26) (0, 5) (16, 18) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (2, 21) (2, 11) (2, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 26) (12, 20) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 24) (17, 21) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 11) (7, 9) (5, 24) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 13) (23, 5) (23, 9) (20, 22) (20, 12) (29, 19) (29, 5) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 8) (27, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the edges to identify the 3-stars. 

After analyzing the graph, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<3, (13, 22, 10)>
<8, (4, 24, 17)>
<11, (14, 7, 2)>
<12, (1, 10, 20)>
<15, (1, 4, 17)>
<18, (11, 6, 16)>
<22, (13, 14, 20)>
<24, (4, 8, 26)>
<26, (0, 12, 28)>
<28, (19, 26, 5)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
