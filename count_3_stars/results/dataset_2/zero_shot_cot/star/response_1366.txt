Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3. These are the potential central nodes for 3-stars. 
Nodes with degree 3 are: 4, 6, 1, 3, and 5.

Next, for each of these nodes, let's check the neighbors to see if they form a 3-star pattern. 
For node 4:
- (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 3)
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>

For node 6:
- (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2)
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<6, (1, 7, 2)>
<6, (4, 7, 3)>

For node 1:
- (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 3)
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<1, (7, 6, 3)>
<1, (9, 6, 3)>

For node 3:
- (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 0)
<3, (4, 7, 1)>
<3, (4, 7, 0)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>

For node 5:
- (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 0)
<5, (4, 6, 2)>
<5, (4, 6, 0)>
<5, (2, 6, 0)>

Counting each unique 3-star found, we have a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [12].
