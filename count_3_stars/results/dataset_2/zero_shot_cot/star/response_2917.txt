Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. From the list of edges, identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star.
2. Count the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.

Based on the provided edge list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Central Node 5: (5, 1, 0), (5, 9, 8)
- Central Node 9: (9, 2, 3)
- Central Node 4: (4, 7, 6)
- Central Node 7: No 3-star since it only has two adjacent nodes.
- Central Node 1: (1, 8, 3)
- Central Node 3: No 3-star since it only has two adjacent nodes.
- Central Node 6: (6, 8, 0)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (1, 0, 5)>
<5, (9, 8, 5)>
<9, (3, 2, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 4)>
<1, (3, 8, 1)>
