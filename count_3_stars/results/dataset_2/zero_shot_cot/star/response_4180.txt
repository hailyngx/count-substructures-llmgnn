Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 0) (12, 8) (12, 19) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 19) (13, 15) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by checking each node if it has exactly three edges connected to it. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (0, 8, 10)>
<3, (4, 8, 11)>
<4, (3, 8, 18)>
<5, (2, 9, 14)>
<6, (15, 14, 19)>
<8, (2, 4, 12)>
<9, (5, 10, 16)>
<10, (0, 2, 14)>
<11, (3, 17, 19)>
<14, (5, 6, 10)>
<15, (13, 17, 6)>
<17, (11, 15, 18)>
<18, (4, 17, 0)>
<19, (3, 6, 11)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us the final answer: [14].
