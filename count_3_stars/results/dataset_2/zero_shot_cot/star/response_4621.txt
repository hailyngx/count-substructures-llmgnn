Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 23) (5, 27) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (9, 12) (2, 29) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 23) (29, 3) (29, 4) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 27) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 3) (26, 17) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 17) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 13) (28, 26) (28, 11) (28, 24) (4, 29) (4, 25) (27, 5) (27, 9) (27, 1) (27, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (21, 12) (21, 25) (21, 17) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (23, 5) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 3) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 9) (18, 19) (7, 11) (7, 24) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 21) (14, 6) (14, 15) (25, 4) (25, 21) (25, 16) (25, 0) (3, 29) (3, 26) (3, 8) (3, 23) (20, 22) (20, 16) (24, 28) (24, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 16) (13, 11) (13, 10) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 10) (22, 8) (22, 20) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 25) (15, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph together.

The candidates for the center nodes can be found by checking nodes with 3 degrees. 
Let's list the nodes with 3 degrees: 
- Node 19 has degree 4 (19, 2), (19, 26), (19, 18), (19, 17)
- Node 26 has degree 4 (26, 19), (26, 28), (26, 3), (26, 17)
- Node 27 has degree 4 (27, 5), (27, 9), (27, 1), (27, 17)
- Node 29 has degree 4 (29, 2), (29, 23), (29, 3), (29, 4)

We notice that nodes 19, 26, 27, and 29 can be center nodes for 3-stars.

Let's find the leaves for each center:
1. Center node 19: 
- Leaves: 2, 26, 18, 17
- <19, (2, 26, 18)>, <19, (2, 26, 17)>, <19, (26, 18, 17)>, <19, (2, 18, 17)>
2. Center node 26:
- Leaves: 19, 28, 3, 17
- <26, (19, 28, 3)>, <26, (19, 28, 17)>, <26, (19, 3, 17)>, <26, (28, 3, 17)>
3. Center node 27:
- Leaves: 5, 9, 1, 17
- <27, (5, 9, 1)>, <27, (5, 9, 17)>, <27, (5, 1, 17)>, <27, (9, 1, 17)>
4. Center node 29:
- Leaves: 2, 23, 3, 4
- <29, (2, 23, 3)>, <29, (2, 23, 4)>, <29, (2, 3, 4)>, <29, (23, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
