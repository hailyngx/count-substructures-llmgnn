Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8. Thus, <5, (9, 6, 8)>
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2. Thus, <9, (5, 6, 2)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 0. Thus, <4, (7, 8, 0)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 3. Thus, <7, (4, 0, 3)>
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7. Thus, <6, (5, 9, 7)>
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 2. Thus, <8, (5, 4, 2)>
7. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 6. Thus, <2, (9, 1, 6)>
8. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 7. Thus, <1, (5, 2, 7)>
9. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 0. Thus, <3, (4, 7, 0)>
10. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 4. Thus, <0, (5, 9, 4)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-star structures:
