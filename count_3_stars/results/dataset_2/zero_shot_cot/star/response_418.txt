Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>
<4, (9, 8, 5)>
<7, (6, 0, 2)>
<8, (6, 4, 3)>
<0, (7, 3, 1)>
<2, (6, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 2)>
<3, (9, 8, 0)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
