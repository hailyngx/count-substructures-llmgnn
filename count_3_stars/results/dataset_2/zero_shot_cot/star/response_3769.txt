Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 10) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 7) (1, 19) (17, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 0) (19, 15) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 13) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (5, 16) (5, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 18) (6, 2) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 17, 16, 15, and 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 13, and 10.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 18, 11, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 16, and 11.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 14, and 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 15, 3, and 14.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 19, 6, and 7.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 18, 1, 0, and 15.

Next, let's arrange each 3-star in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:
<0, (17, 16, 19)>
<2, (9, 11, 5)>
<4, (18, 13, 10)>
<7, (18, 11, 14)>
<8, (9, 16, 11)>
<12, (0, 14, 11)>
<13, (4, 15, 3)>
<18, (4, 19, 6)>
<19, (18, 1, 15)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are 9 in total. 
Thus, the final answer is [9].
