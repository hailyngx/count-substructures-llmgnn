Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 14) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 10) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: 9, 2, 8, 7, 12, 13, 11, 0, 1, 14, 10

Next, let's list the 3-stars with the center and leaves in ascending order:

<0, (4, 7, 11)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 10)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (7, 9, 11)>
<3, (6, 10, 12)>
<4, (0, 6, 13)>
<7, (1, 2, 14)>
<7, (1, 7, 12)>
<9, (2, 11, 3)>
<10, (1, 12, 14)>
<11, (0, 3, 12)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [13].
