Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 16) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 22) (29, 26) (29, 15) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 5) (19, 5) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 29) (26, 10) (26, 17) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 18) (21, 25) (9, 8) (9, 22) (22, 28) (22, 19) (22, 9) (17, 1) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 23) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 0) (20, 27) (20, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 24) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 24) (10, 26) (10, 2) (18, 19) (18, 21) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 7) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 10) (2, 14) (7, 8) (7, 24) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 15) (23, 3) (23, 27) (23, 25) (25, 21) (25, 23) (25, 15) (14, 20) (14, 2) (15, 29) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars:

<1, (2, 17, 13)>
<3, (6, 28, 23)>
<8, (7, 9, 13)>
<13, (1, 8, 16)>
<28, (6, 21, 22)>
<29, (15, 26, 5)>
<6, (28, 21, 11)>
<19, (5, 21, 18)>
<26, (10, 17, 29)>
<21, (6, 19, 28)>
<9, (7, 22, 8)>
<22, (9, 19, 28)>
<17, (1, 26, 15)>
<4, (0, 12, 24)>
<27, (2, 20, 23)>
<5, (6, 19, 0)>
<20, (14, 27, 2)>
<0, (4, 16, 5)>
<16, (0, 13, 24)>
<12, (4, 24, 6)>
<10, (2, 26, 17)>
<18, (19, 21, 6)>
<24, (16, 7, 12)>
<2, (1, 14, 27)>
<7, (8, 24, 13)>
<11, (6, 17, 15)>
<23, (3, 25, 27)>
<25, (15, 21, 23)>
<14, (20, 2, 27)>

From the identified 3-stars above, we can see that there are 29 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [29].
