Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 5, and 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 0, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 0, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 1, and 0.

From the list above, <0, (9, 3, 4)> and <7, (5, 8, 6)> are the only unique 3-stars found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
