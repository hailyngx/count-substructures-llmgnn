- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star since it's only connected to nodes 12, 4, and 18, and not in a star pattern.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 29, 28, and 4, forming a 3-star: <2, (29, 28, 4)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 1, and 14, forming a 3-star: <4, (12, 1, 14)>.
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star since it's only connected to nodes 28, 19, 23, and not in a star pattern.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star since it's only connected to nodes 25, 10, 11, 19, and not in a star pattern.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star since it's only connected to nodes 3, 27, 9, 29, and not in a star pattern.
