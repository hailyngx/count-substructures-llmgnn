Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

[5]

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 0)>
<2, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (4, 5, 0)>
<4, (1, 9, 8)>
