Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 23) (1, 27) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 11) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (2, 22) (2, 16) (29, 28) (8, 7) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 22) (23, 1) (23, 8) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 12) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 24) (20, 10) (26, 1) (26, 27) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 12) (28, 4) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (18, 7) (18, 13) (22, 2) (22, 8) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 3) (3, 22) (17, 12) (17, 27) (9, 25) (9, 15) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 15) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 14) (24, 8) (24, 20) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 25) (15, 5) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (27, 1) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 17) (10, 20) (10, 6) (10, 5) (16, 2) (16, 19) (14, 13) (14, 19) (5, 15) (5, 10) (11, 21) (11, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (26, 23, 27)>
<21, (13, 27, 11)>
<4, (28, 11, 15)>
<7, (20, 19, 18)>
<8, (23, 24, 12)>
<2, (22, 16, 0)>
<29, (28, 6, 19)>
<3, (22, 17, -)>
<9, (25, 15, -)>
<5, (15, 10, -)>

We found 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
