Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node to find the 3-stars. Let's list the connections for each node:

Node 0: {1, 2, 5, 11, 12}
Node 1: {0, 4}
Node 2: {0, 5, 6, 11, 14}
Node 3: {8, 9}
Node 4: {1, 6, 7}
Node 5: {0, 2, 7, 8, 10}
Node 6: {2, 4, 9, 11}
Node 7: {4, 5, 9, 12, 13}
Node 8: {3, 5, 8, 10, 13}
Node 9: {3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13}
Node 10: {5, 8, 9, 11, 12}
Node 11: {0, 2, 6, 10}
Node 12: {0, 7, 10}
Node 13: {7, 8, 9, 14}
Node 14: {2, 13}

Now, we can identify the 3-stars by looking at the connections of each node. For a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 4>
<0, 2, 5>
<0, 5, 7>
<0, 11, 2>
<0, 12, 7>
<1, 0, 4>
<2, 0, 5>
<2, 5, 7>
<2, 6, 4>
<2, 11, 0>
<3, 8, 9>
<4, 1, 6>
<4, 6, 7>
<5, 0, 2>
<5, 2, 7>
<5, 7, 8>
<6, 2, 4>
<6, 4, 7>
<7, 0, 5>
<7, 2, 5>
<7, 5, 8>
<8, 3, 9>
<8, 5, 7>
<8, 5, 10>
<9, 3, 8>
<9, 4, 6>
<9, 6, 7>
<10, 5, 8>
<10, 8, 9>
<10, 12, 7>
<11, 0, 2>
<11, 2, 6>
<12, 0, 7>
<13, 7, 8>
<14, 2, 13>

Count of 3-stars: [34]
