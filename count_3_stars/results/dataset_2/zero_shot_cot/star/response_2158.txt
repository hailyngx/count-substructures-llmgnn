Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of nodes which have exactly three incident edges in the given graph.

Let's calculate this step by step:

1. Nodes with 3 incident edges:
- Node 1 has 3 incident edges: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 2)
- Node 10 has 3 incident edges: (10, 19), (10, 7), (10, 14)
- Node 13 has 3 incident edges: (13, 1), (13, 6), (13, 10)

Now, we count the number of 3-stars:

- For Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 2)>
- For Node 10: <10, (19, 7, 14)>
- For Node 13: <13, (1, 6, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
