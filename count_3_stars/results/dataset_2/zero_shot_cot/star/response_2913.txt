Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 18) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 12) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 15) (17, 8) (17, 22) (29, 15) (29, 14) (21, 4) (21, 24) (28, 0) (28, 24) (26, 24) (26, 27) (24, 21) (24, 28) (24, 26) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 27) (12, 8) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 3) (23, 10) (23, 5) (23, 3) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 19) (1, 5) (1, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (3, 13) (3, 20) (3, 12) (3, 23) (3, 14) (14, 29) (14, 3) (14, 18) (0, 28) (0, 19) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 27) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 16) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 1) (18, 14) (16, 20) (16, 9) (16, 27) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, first, we need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's look at each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 

1. Nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 25, 26, 28, 29 do not form 3-stars since they are not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

2. Node 2: <2, (8, 12, 22)>, <2, (12, 15, 22)>
3. Node 3: <3, (12, 20, 23)>, <3, (13, 14, 18)>
4. Node 4: <4, (19, 21, 22)>, <4, (14, 18, 19)>
5. Node 7: <7, (8, 9, 22)>, <7, (8, 9, 27)>
6. Node 8: <8, (7, 10, 17)>, <8, (8, 12, 13)>, <8, (8, 12, 25)>, <8, (8, 17, 22)>
7. Node 9: <9, (7, 9, 15)>, <9, (9, 16, 27)>
8. Node 12: <12, (2, 8, 22)>, <12, (3, 12, 23)>, <12, (8, 12, 25)>, <12, (12, 15, 27)>, <12, (12, 15, 3)>
9. Node 17: <17, (8, 17, 22)>
10. Node 20: <20, (3, 16, 18)>, <20, (20, 25, 3)>
11. Node 21: <21, (24, 4, 22)>
12. Node 22: <22, (2, 4, 22)>, <22, (22, 17, 27)>
13. Node 23: <23, (10, 3, 5)>, <23, (3, 12, 14)>
14. Node 24: <24, (21, 26, 28)>
15. Node 27: <27, (16, 22, 27)>, <27, (22, 27, 9)>, <27, (22, 26, 27)>, <27, (27, 16, 9)>
16. Node 3: <3, (12, 20, 23)>, <3, (13, 14, 18)>
17. Node 3: <3, (12, 20, 23)>, <3, (13, 14, 18)>
18. Node 16: <16, (20, 27, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
