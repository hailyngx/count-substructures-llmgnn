Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 18) (15, 2) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 16) (1, 29) (1, 23) (1, 18) (21, 24) (21, 0) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 17) (12, 17) (12, 9) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 4) (19, 26) (19, 14) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 23) (26, 25) (24, 21) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 20) (24, 25) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 16) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 2) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 20) (28, 24) (22, 27) (22, 20) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 29) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 6) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 25) (16, 27) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 20) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 3) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 25) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 16) (8, 0) (9, 12) (25, 26) (25, 24) (25, 29) (25, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars. 
Based on the given edges, the potential central nodes are: 18, 21, 0, 11, 4, 26, 24, 13, 5, 14, 23, 29, 16, 3, 7, 12, 20, 25.

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (27, 21, 8)>
<0, (27, 13, 21)>
<0, (27, 13, 0)>
<0, (21, 24, 8)>
<0, (21, 24, 13)>
<0, (21, 24, 3)>
<0, (8, 27, 13)>
<11, (10, 18, 3)>
<11, (10, 5, 18)>
<11, (10, 5, 14)>
<11, (18, 15, 1)>
<11, (18, 4, 5)>
<11, (14, 19, 29)>
<4, (7, 26, 18)>
<4, (7, 2, 18)>
<4, (7, 2, 6)>
<7, (4, 17, 2)>
<7, (4, 17, 6)>
<7, (17, 12, 6)>
<13, (26, 0, 23)>
<13, (26, 0, 16)>
<13, (26, 23, 5)>
<16, (27, 20, 17)>
<16, (27, 17, 13)>
<16, (27, 20, 3)>
<16, (17, 12, 13)>
<16, (17, 2, 20)>
<16, (17, 2, 6)>
<24, (21, 25, 28)>
<24, (21, 25, 20)>
<24, (25, 29, 6)>
<3, (11, 24, 2)>
<25, (26, 29, 24)>
<25, (26, 29, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [26].
