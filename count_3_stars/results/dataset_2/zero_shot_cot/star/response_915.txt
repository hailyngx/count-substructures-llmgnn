Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 17) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 13) (17, 11) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 19) (8, 12) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 3) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 16) (6, 14) (6, 3) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Starting with node 5:
<5, (9, 13, 2)>
<5, (9, 18, 3)>

2. Moving on to node 9:
<9, (5, 16, 0)>

3. Proceeding to node 4:
<4, (12, 13, -)>

4. Examining node 7:
<7, (11, 14, 18)>

5. Moving to node 10:
<10, (11, 16, -)>

6. Continuing with node 11:
<11, (7, 1, 17)>

7. Moving on to node 13:
<13, (5, 4, 14)>

8. Proceeding to node 8:
<8, (12, 19, -)>

9. Examining node 1:
<1, (11, 18, 13)>

10. Proceeding to node 17:
<17, (11, 2, -)>

11. Moving to node 19:
<19, (8, 15, 3)>

12. Continuing with node 12:
<12, (4, 11, 18)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
