Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 23) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 19) (18, 12) (18, 28) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (20, 27) (20, 7) (20, 28) (23, 0) (23, 22) (5, 4) (5, 17) (6, 0) (6, 22) (6, 15) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 3) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 16) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 7) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (10, 0) (10, 26) (10, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 14) (2, 27) (12, 18) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 24) (24, 19) (24, 8) (24, 11) (3, 19) (3, 13) (7, 20) (7, 28) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 12) (1, 14) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, the unique 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (27, 10, 17)>
<0, (27, 23, 6)>
<27, (0, 2, 20)>
<27, (19, 20, 2)>
<18, (28, 12, 1)>
<22, (23, 9, 6)>
<22, (6, 21, 22)>
<20, (27, 7, 28)>
<23, (22, 0, 22)>
<5, (17, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 15, 22)>
<19, (27, 17, 19)>
<19, (26, 24, 3)>
<26, (19, 28, 13)>
<9, (22, 8, 28)>
<9, (11, 9, 16)>
<28, (18, 26, 20)>
<28, (9, 7, 28)>
<4, (5, 15, 16)>
<13, (26, 3, 17)>
<8, (24, 11, 16)>
<17, (0, 13, 5)>
<10, (21, 27, 10)>
<21, (22, 10, 21)>
<16, (9, 8, 4)>
<12, (18, 1, 12)>
<11, (9, 24, 8)>
<24, (19, 11, 8)>
<3, (19, 13, 3)>
<7, (20, 28, 7)>
<14, (16, 15, 14)>
<1, (12, 14, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].
