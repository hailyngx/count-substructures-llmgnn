Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 7) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 13) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 3) (18, 4) (18, 16) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 16) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 1) (16, 15) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to identify 3-stars:
- Node 1: (4, 6, 8, 15, 16)
- Node 2: (9, 13)
- Node 3: (10, 12)
- Node 4: (1, 7, 18)
- Node 5: (6, 8, 9)
- Node 6: (1, 5, 8)
- Node 7: (4, 14, 17, 19)
- Node 8: (1, 5, 6)
- Node 9: (2, 5, 12, 16)
- Node 10: (3, 11, 13)
- Node 11: (10, 13)
- Node 12: (9, 3, 13)
- Node 13: (2, 10, 11, 12, 15)
- Node 14: (4, 7, 17, 19)
- Node 15: (1, 13, 16)
- Node 16: (9, 1, 15, 18)
- Node 17: (7, 14, 19)
- Node 18: (4, 16)
- Node 19: (14, 17, 7)

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 15, 16)>
- <1, (6, 5, 8)>
- <1, (8, 5, 6)>
- <2, (9, 12, 13)>
- <3, (10, 11, 13)>
- <4, (1, 7, 14)>
- <4, (7, 17, 19)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <7, (4, 14, 17)>
- <9, (2, 12, 13)>
- <12, (9, 13, 15)>
- <13, (10, 11, 12)>
- <14, (4, 17, 19)>
- <16, (1, 9, 15)>
- <17, (7, 14, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
