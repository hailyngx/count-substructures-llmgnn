Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 22) (27, 18) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 25) (13, 8) (13, 23) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 19) (12, 9) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 15) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 4) (26, 17) (26, 10) (3, 16) (3, 23) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 20) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 19) (21, 10) (21, 25) (18, 0) (18, 27) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 16) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 15) (25, 27) (25, 8) (25, 21) (25, 22) (10, 26) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 14) (4, 28) (4, 11) (24, 5) (24, 2) (24, 23) (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 23) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 24) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 19) (14, 6) (14, 10) (9, 12) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 20) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 20) (20, 8) (20, 11) (20, 22) (20, 16) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 24) (23, 1) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's count the number of 3-stars in the provided graph.

To find the 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-star structures found in the graph:

<0, (27, 15, 18)>
<27, (0, 25, 22)>
<8, (13, 20, 25)>
<13, (8, 23, 7)>
<7, (12, 6, 23)>
<12, (7, 19, 9)>
<17, (29, 28, 26)>
<29, (17, 15, 1)>
<28, (17, 1, 4)>
<26, (17, 10, 9)>
<3, (16, 23, 5)>
<11, (4, 20, 2)>
<6, (7, 14, 19)>
<21, (10, 25, 22)>
<5, (7, 24, 16)>
<19, (12, 6, 15)>
<25, (27, 8, 21)>
<10, (26, 21, 2)>
<4, (28, 11, 11)>
<24, (5, 2, 23)>
<1, (29, 28, 23)>
<2, (11, 10, 5)>
<15, (0, 29, 19)>
<14, (6, 10, 10)>
<9, (12, 26, 26)>
<22, (27, 25, 20)>
<16, (3, 5, 20)>
<20, (8, 11, 22)>
<23, (13, 7, 3)>

Now, we count the unique 3-stars found. 

There are <30> unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is: [30].
