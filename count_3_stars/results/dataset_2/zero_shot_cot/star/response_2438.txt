Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 15) (5, 3) (19, 4) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 8) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 2) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 16) (13, 10) (2, 14) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 6) (11, 17) (11, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will form the centers of the 3-stars.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 3, 4, 5.

Next, we will examine each of these nodes to determine their 3-star configurations:

1: (1, 7, 12), (1, 17, 16), (1, 17, 1)
3: (3, 5, 9), (3, 15, 16), (3, 9, 10)
4: (4, 13, 18)
5: (5, 15, 17)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have <1, (7, 12, 1)>, <1, (17, 16, 1)>, <3, (5, 9, 3)>, <3, (15, 16, 3)>, <4, (13, 18, 4)>, and <5, (15, 17, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
