Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and 8 have exactly three edges each. So, these nodes can be considered as the centers of the 3-stars.

Now, let's list the 3-stars with unique combinations:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (8, 7, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get: [6].
