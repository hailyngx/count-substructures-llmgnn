Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 12) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are: 
<2, (6, 14, 12)>
<6, (7, 2, 1)>
<7, (6, 8, 11)>
<8, (10, 5, 3)>
<10, (9, 1, 8)>
<11, (14, 0, 12)>
<12, (14, 11, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
