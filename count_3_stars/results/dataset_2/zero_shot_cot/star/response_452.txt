Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
