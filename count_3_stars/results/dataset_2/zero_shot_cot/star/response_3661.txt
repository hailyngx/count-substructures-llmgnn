Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <6, (9, 4, 1)>
2. <9, (6, 8, 2)>
3. <4, (6, 8, 5)>
4. <8, (6, 9, 4)>
5. <5, (4, 8, 1)>
6. <0, (9, 3, 2)>
7. <7, (5, 2, -)>
8. <1, (6, 9, 5)>
9. <3, (4, 8, 0)>
10. <2, (9, 0, 7)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
