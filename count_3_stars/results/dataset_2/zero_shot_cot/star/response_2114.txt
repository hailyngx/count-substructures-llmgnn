Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 0, 5, 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 7, 3.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 7, 4, 5, 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 0, 3, 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 8, 7, 5, 4.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 0, 3.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 0, 3.

Therefore, there are 4 instances of 3-star configurations in this graph. Let's list them:

<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<8, (6, 2, 7)>
<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
