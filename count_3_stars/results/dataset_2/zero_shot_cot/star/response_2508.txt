Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them:

Nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 1: (9, 3, 6)
- Node 3: (1, 7, 2)
- Node 8: (13, 14, 0)
- Node 13: (5, 8, 2)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- From node 1: <1, (9, 3, 6)>
- From node 3: <3, (1, 7, 2)>
- From node 8: <8, (13, 14, 0)>
- From node 13: <13, (5, 8, 2)>

[The number of 3-stars in the graph is 4]
