Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has the center connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with exactly three adjacent edges. Then, we check those nodes' neighbors to see if they form a 3-star.

Nodes with exactly three adjacent edges are: 5, 9, 6, and 8.

For node 5, the 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 0, 7)>

For node 9, the 3-stars are:
<9, (6, 8, 0)>
<9, (6, 2, 0)>

For node 6, the 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>

For node 8, the 3-stars are:
<8, (9, 3, 2)>
<8, (9, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 0, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 0)>
<9, (6, 2, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<8, (9, 3, 2)>
<8, (9, 2, 0)>
