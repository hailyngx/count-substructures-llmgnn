Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 19) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 11) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (12, 18) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 11, 12, 14, 18

Next, we will find all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 15)>
<2, (10, 13, 18)>
<5, (3, 15, 18)>
<11, (0, 12, 14)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: [5].
