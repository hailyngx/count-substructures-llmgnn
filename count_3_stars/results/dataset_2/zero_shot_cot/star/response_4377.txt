Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (4, 1) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 15) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars.

First, let's list out all the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 13, 18
- Node 1: 4, 11, 16, 17
- Node 2: 5, 10, 13, 14, 19
- Node 3: 14, 15, 16
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 2, 10, 12, 19
- Node 6: 0, 4, 12
- Node 7: 8, 10
- Node 8: 0, 7, 11, 14
- Node 9: 15
- Node 10: 2, 5, 7
- Node 11: 1, 8, 17, 18
- Node 12: 6, 16, 19
- Node 13: 0, 2
- Node 14: 2, 3, 8
- Node 15: 3, 9, 17
- Node 16: 1, 3, 12
- Node 17: 1, 11, 15
- Node 18: 0, 11
- Node 19: 2, 5, 12

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 16, and 17: <1, (4, 16, 17)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 14, and 19: <2, (5, 14, 19)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 15, and 16: <3, (14, 15, 16)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 11: <8, (0, 7, 11)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 17, and 18: <11, (1, 17, 18)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 12: <16, (1, 3, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
