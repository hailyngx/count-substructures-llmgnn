Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (19, 15) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (18, 3) (18, 5) (13, 14) (16, 6) (16, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 14)>
<2, (9, 10, 17)>
<3, (11, 0, 16)>
<5, (15, 2, 18)>
<7, (17, 0, 14)>
<9, (6, 2, 11)>
<11, (9, 3, 14)>
<14, (1, 7, 11)>
<15, (0, 1, 19)>
<17, (10, 7, 2)>
<18, (3, 5, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
