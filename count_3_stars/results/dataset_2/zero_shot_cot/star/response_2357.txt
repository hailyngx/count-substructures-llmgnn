Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
We will count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's start by examining each node one by one:

- Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 5) --> forms a 3-star <0, (9, 4, 7)>
- Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 7) --> forms a 3-star <1, (9, 2, 8)>
- Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 5) --> forms a 3-star <2, (9, 1, 8)>
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 4) --> Not part of any 3-star
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 5) --> forms a 3-star <4, (3, 7, 8)> and <4, (0, 7, 5)>
- Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 2), (5, 0) --> forms a 3-star <5, (4, 7, 8)> and <5, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: (6, 8) --> Not part of any 3-star
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 5) --> forms a 3-star <7, (1, 4, 0)> and <7, (4, 0, 5)>
- Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 0) --> forms a 3-star <8, (6, 1, 4)> and <8, (1, 2, 5)> and <8, (4, 2, 5)> and <8, (2, 5, 0)> and <8, (5, 0, 7)>
- Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0) --> forms a 3-star <9, (2, 3, 1)> and <9, (2, 1, 8)> and <9, (3, 1, 4)> and <9, (1, 4, 7)> and <9, (4, 7, 0)>

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<1, (9, 2, 8)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 5)>
<8, (6, 1, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 0)>
<8, (5, 0, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 1)>
<9, (2, 1, 8)>
<9, (3, 1, 4)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
