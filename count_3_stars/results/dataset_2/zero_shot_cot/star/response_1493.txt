Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (18, 12) (18, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by finding all the 3-stars:

<1, (5, 2, 13)>
<2, (1, 5, 13)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (19, 6, 18)>
<5, (1, 14, 0)>
<6, (4, 8, 15)>
<7, (16, 3, 8)>
<8, (7, 10, 6)>
<9, (11, 12, 3)>
<10, (8, 15, 18)>
<11, (9, 17, 13)>
<12, (9, 17, 18)>
<13, (11, 16, 1)>
<14, (5, 19, 3)>
<15, (10, 19, 6)>
<16, (14, 7, 13)>
<17, (11, 12, 6)>
<18, (12, 10, 17)>
<19, (4, 15, 14)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are <19> such 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [19].
