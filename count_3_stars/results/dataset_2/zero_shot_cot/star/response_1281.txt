Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to identify all the 3-stars. 

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 13
- Node 1: 2, 8, 13, 10, 14
- Node 2: 1, 4, 13
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8, 11, 14
- Node 4: 2, 3, 12
- Node 5: 7, 9, 10, 12, 13
- Node 6: 0, 11, 12
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8, 9, 11
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8, 11
- Node 10: 1, 5, 12
- Node 11: 3, 6, 7, 9, 12
- Node 12: 4, 5, 6, 10, 11
- Node 13: 0, 1, 2, 5, 8
- Node 14: 1, 3

Looking at the neighbors of each node, we can find the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 13)>
<1, (2, 8, 13)>
<3, (4, 7, 14)>
<4, (2, 3, 12)>
<5, (7, 9, 13)>
<7, (3, 9, 11)>
<8, (1, 3, 13)>
<9, (5, 7, 11)>
<11, (6, 7, 12)>
<12, (4, 10, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
