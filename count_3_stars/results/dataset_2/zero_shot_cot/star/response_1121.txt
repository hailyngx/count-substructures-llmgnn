Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 6) (14, 13) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 17) (15, 7) (15, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 17) (4, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Next, we will find all 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (9, 17, 12)>
2. <1, (6, 2, 7)>
3. <2, (8, 10, 19)>
4. <3, (8, 11, 12)>
5. <4, (11, 13, 18)>
6. <5, (9, 18, 19)>
7. <6, (1, 14, 6)>
8. <7, (1, 15, 19)>
9. <8, (2, 3, 16)>
10. <9, (5, 0, 19)>
11. <10, (2, 8, 19)>
12. <11, (3, 4, 18)>
13. <12, (0, 3, 17)>
14. <13, (14, 18, 0)>
15. <14, (6, 13, 14)>
16. <15, (16, 7, 15)>
17. <16, (8, 17, 15)>
18. <17, (0, 16, 19)>
19. <18, (5, 13, 11)>
20. <19, (9, 7, 17)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [20].
