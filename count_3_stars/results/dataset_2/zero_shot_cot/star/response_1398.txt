Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 9) (13, 18) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (4, 7) (4, 25) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 24) (7, 1) (10, 22) (10, 11) (10, 27) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 27) (11, 25) (11, 17) (12, 27) (12, 0) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 20) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 28) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 21) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 6) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 9) (23, 11) (23, 26) (3, 28) (3, 6) (28, 1) (28, 19) (28, 3) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 16) (24, 7) (24, 0) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 6) (5, 22) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 21) (0, 12) (0, 24) (0, 15) (14, 18) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 21) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 18) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 22) (20, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (21, 2) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look for each node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it, which is the definition of a central node in a 3-star. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

Node 0: It has 3 edges connected to it: (0, 12), (0, 24), (0, 15). So, <0, (12, 24, 15)> is a 3-star.
Node 1: It has 3 edges connected to it: (1, 7), (1, 26), (1, 28). So, <1, (7, 26, 28)> is a 3-star.
Node 2: It has 3 edges connected to it: (2, 26), (2, 5), (2, 21). So, <2, (26, 5, 21)> is a 3-star.
Node 3: It has 2 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 4: It has 3 edges connected to it: (4, 7), (4, 25), (4, 29). So, <4, (7, 25, 29)> is a 3-star.
Node 5: It has 3 edges connected to it: (5, 22), (5, 2), (5, 8). So, <5, (22, 2, 8)> is a 3-star.
Node 6: It has 3 edges connected to it: (6, 8), (6, 3), (6, 17). So, <6, (8, 3, 17)> is a 3-star.
Node 7: It has 4 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 8: It has 3 edges connected to it: (8, 5), (8, 21), (8, 6). So, <8, (5, 21, 6)> is a 3-star.
Node 9: It has 3 edges connected to it: (9, 13), (9, 19), (9, 16). So, <9, (13, 19, 16)> is a 3-star.
Node 10: It has 3 edges connected to it: (10, 22), (10, 11), (10, 27). So, <10, (22, 11, 27)> is a 3-star.
Node 11: It has 5 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 12: It has 2 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 13: It has 2 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 14: It has 1 edge connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 15: It has 4 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 16: It has 3 edges connected to it: (16, 6), (16, 9), (16, 18). So, <16, (6, 9, 18)> is a 3-star.
Node 17: It has 3 edges connected to it: (17, 11), (17, 19), (17, 6). So, <17, (11, 19, 6)> is a 3-star.
Node 18: It has 4 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 19: It has 4 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 20: It has 2 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 21: It has 4 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 22: It has 3 edges connected to it: (22, 5), (22, 10), (22, 20). So, <22, (5, 10, 20)> is a 3-star.
Node 23: It has 2 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 24: It has 2 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 25: It has 2 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 26: It has 3 edges connected to it: (26, 1), (26, 19), (26, 2). So, <26, (1, 19, 2)> is a 3-star.
Node 27: It has 4 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.
Node 28: It has 3 edges connected to it: (28, 1), (28, 19), (28, 3). So, <28, (1, 19, 3)> is a 3-star.
Node 29: It has 2 edges connected to it, not a 3-star.

So the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (12, 24, 15)>, <1, (7, 26, 28)>, <2, (26, 5, 21)>, <4, (7, 25, 29)>, <5, (22, 2, 8)>, <6, (8, 3, 17)>, <9, (13, 19, 16)>, <10, (22, 11, 27)>, <16, (6, 9, 18)>, <17, (11, 19, 6)>, <22, (5, 10, 20)>, <26, (1, 19, 2)>, <28, (1, 19, 3)>.

The total number of 3-stars is [13].
