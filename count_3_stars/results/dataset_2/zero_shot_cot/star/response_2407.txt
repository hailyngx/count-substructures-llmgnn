Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (27, 2) (27, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 29) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 21) (10, 11) (10, 20) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 29) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 26) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 12) (6, 13) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 13) (28, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 20) (8, 16) (9, 27) (9, 8) (23, 11) (23, 24) (23, 12) (15, 28) (15, 16) (15, 22) (15, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 15) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 1) (26, 5) (26, 3) (25, 17) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 23) (24, 4) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 28) (7, 3) (7, 20) (4, 15) (4, 24) (4, 3) (12, 6) (12, 23) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 7) (1, 18) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 1) (29, 14) (29, 11) (22, 15) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

The nodes that have 3 edges connected to them are: 0, 8, 14, 17, 21, 28, 5, 6, 11, 24, 16, 23, 4, 12, 20, 1, 2, and 29.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. 

<0, (2, 8, 16)>
<27, (2, 9, 27)>
<14, (11, 24, 29)>
<17, (14, 21, 25)>
<10, (11, 20, 10)>
<5, (6, 19, 26)>
<6, (13, 21, 6)>
<21, (17, 6, 28)>
<28, (13, 15, 28)>
<15, (16, 22, 28)>
<18, (17, 19, 18)>
<26, (3, 5, 26)>
<3, (4, 7, 13)>
<7, (20, 28, 3)>
<4, (3, 15, 24)>
<12, (6, 23, 12)>
<20, (7, 8, 20)>
<1, (2, 18, 1)>
<2, (0, 27, 2)>
<29, (11, 14, 29)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [19].
