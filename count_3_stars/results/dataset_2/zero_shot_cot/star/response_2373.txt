Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

- From node 5: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4)
  <5, (6, 2, 4)>

- From node 9: (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 0)
  <9, (4, 7, 0)>

- From node 4: (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 6)
  <4, (5, 9, 6)>

- From node 7: (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 2)
  <7, (9, 0, 2)>

- From node 8: (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 1)
  <8, (4, 7, 1)>

- From node 2: (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 7)
  <2, (5, 4, 7)>

- From node 6: (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)
  <6, (5, 4, 3)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
