Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (17, 14) (17, 16) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 9) (22, 5) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 3) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 13) (28, 21) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 25) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (15, 12) (15, 1) (8, 6) (8, 26) (8, 9) (8, 29) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 19) (10, 27) (25, 6) (25, 26) (25, 4) (27, 14) (27, 10) (11, 26) (11, 0) (0, 11) (3, 23) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 18) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 4) (13, 21) (13, 6) (13, 29) (2, 23) (2, 1) (20, 26) (20, 16) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 4) (5, 22) (5, 18) (5, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 5) (4, 1) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 29) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (4, 16, 15)>
<2, (1, 23, 16)>
<3, (9, 23, 3)>
<4, (1, 5, 25)>
<5, (18, 4, 5)>
<6, (13, 29, 6)>
<7, (10, 21, 7)>
<8, (9, 29, 8)>
<9, (7, 21, 9)>
<10, (19, 27, 10)>
<11, (0, 26, 11)>
<12, (15, 18, 12)>
<13, (6, 21, 13)>
<14, (27, 17, 14)>
<16, (17, 24, 16)>
<18, (5, 18, 16)>
<20, (16, 26, 20)>
<21, (7, 13, 21)>
<22, (24, 5, 22)>
<23, (2, 9, 23)>
<25, (26, 4, 25)>
<26, (8, 11, 26)>
<27, (10, 14, 27)>
<28, (21, 28, 7)>
<29, (4, 13, 29)>

There are 25 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [25].
