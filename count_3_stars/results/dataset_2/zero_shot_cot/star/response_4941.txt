Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 7) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 11) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (16, 13) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 1) (1, 18) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star structures in the given graph. 

First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as they have the potential to form 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3: (3, 0), (15, 8), (5, 9), (13, 17), (17, 12), (8, 19), (7, 14), (16, 0), (14, 2), (2, 11), (6, 12), (18, 1)

Now, let's check each potential 3-star to see if it matches the criteria of being a 3-star structure:

1. (3, 0) - Not a 3-star.
2. (15, 8) - Not a 3-star.
3. (5, 9) - Not a 3-star.
4. (13, 17) - <13, (17, 12, 0)>
5. (17, 12) - <17, (12, 13, 2)>
6. (8, 19) - Not a 3-star.
7. (7, 14) - <7, (14, 8, 6)>
8. (16, 0) - Not a 3-star.
9. (14, 2) - Not a 3-star.
10. (2, 11) - <2, (11, 17, 14)>
11. (6, 12) - <6, (12, 13, 7)>
12. (18, 1) - Not a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars are <13, (17, 12, 0)>, <17, (12, 13, 2)>, <7, (14, 8, 6)>, and <2, (11, 17, 14)>.
