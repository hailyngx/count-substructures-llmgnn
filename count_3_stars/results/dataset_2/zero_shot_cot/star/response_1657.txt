Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 1, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 5)>
3. <3, (5, 1, 4)>
4. <4, (9, 6, 3)>
5. <5, (9, 6, 1)>
6. <6, (5, 8, 4)>
7. <7, (9, 8, 1)>
8. <8, (9, 6, 7)>
9. <9, (7, 8, 4)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [9].
