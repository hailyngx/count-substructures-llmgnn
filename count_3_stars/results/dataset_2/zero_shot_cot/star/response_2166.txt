Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 since it has the highest degree in the graph: nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7.

Now, we look for 3-stars using node 5 as the center:
- Node 0, 1, and 4 are all connected to node 5: <5, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 0, 1, and 7 are all connected to node 5: <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- Node 0, 2, and 6 are all connected to node 5: <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 1, 6, and 9 are all connected to node 5: <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- Node 2, 7, and 8 are all connected to node 5: <5, (2, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
