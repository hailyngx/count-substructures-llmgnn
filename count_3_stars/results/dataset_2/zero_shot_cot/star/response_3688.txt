Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (2, 0) (2, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 17) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 7) (19, 4) (19, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (6, 18) (16, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in each edge:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 10.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 17.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 10.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 9, 11, and 19.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 12, 13, and 17.
- Node 6 is connected to node 18.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 13 and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 15.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 10, and 19.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 14, 17, and 18.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 11, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 15.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11 and 12.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 17.
- Node 16 is connected to node 17.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 11, 15, and 16.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 11.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (4, 9, 17)>
<3, (0, 8, 15)>
<4, (1, 9, 19)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<11, (4, 12, 17)>
<12, (5, 11, 14)>
<13, (5, 7, 15)>
<17, (1, 11, 15)>
