Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 5) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 13) (29, 23) (20, 7) (20, 9) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 17) (26, 19) (26, 23) (21, 28) (21, 3) (28, 21) (28, 16) (9, 20) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 16) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 25) (22, 3) (11, 19) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 6) (8, 9) (8, 25) (18, 19) (18, 9) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 22) (3, 23) (0, 4) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (23, 29) (23, 26) (23, 3) (23, 25) (1, 15) (1, 7) (1, 24) (24, 22) (24, 1) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 27) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 25) (14, 12) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 25) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 17) (13, 29) (13, 10) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 7) (25, 6) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms the structure of a 3-star.

Nodes:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 27, 21, 22, and 23.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 20, 22, 8, and 18.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 17.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 29, 10, and 23.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<3, (27, 21, 22)>  
<3, (27, 21, 23)>  
<3, (27, 22, 23)>  
<9, (20, 8, 18)>  
<12, (10, 14, 17)>  
<13, (29, 10, 23)> 

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
