Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 22) (1, 7) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 12) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 9) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 24) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 16) (9, 2) (18, 20) (18, 3) (22, 1) (22, 4) (22, 17) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 3) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 3) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 15) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 23) (26, 2) (26, 6) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 18) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 24) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 25) (23, 19) (16, 21) (16, 27) (16, 8) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 14) (24, 29) (24, 10) (24, 6) (24, 28) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 25) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 14) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 19) (3, 18) (3, 12) (3, 8) (13, 10) (13, 25) (25, 23) (25, 28) (25, 13) (19, 23) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (14, 22, 7)>
2. <3, (18, 12, 8)>
3. <6, (26, 24, 14)>
4. <9, (2, 20, 29)>
5. <10, (15, 24, 13)>
6. <11, (4, 14, 19)>
7. <17, (22, 23, 29)>
8. <23, (7, 25, 17)>
9. <27, (0, 12, 16)>
10. <28, (12, 25, 24)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars gives us [10].
