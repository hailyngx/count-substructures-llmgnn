Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- From node 4: (4, 7, 1), (4, 7, 3), (4, 7, 2)
- From node 7: (7, 4, 3), (7, 4, 6), (7, 4, 8)
- From node 1: (1, 4, 3), (1, 4, 9), (1, 4, 0)
- From node 3: (3, 4, 7), (3, 4, 1), (3, 4, 9)
- From node 5: (5, 7, 2), (5, 7, 8)
- From node 6: (6, 7, 2), (6, 7, 8)
- From node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 9), (0, 1, 2)
- From node 2: (2, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6), (2, 4, 0)
- From node 8: (8, 7, 3), (8, 7, 5), (8, 7, 6)
- From node 9: (9, 4, 1), (9, 4, 3), (9, 4, 0)

Therefore, there are 14 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
The unique 3-stars are: 
<4, (7, 1, 3)>, <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <1, (4, 9, 0)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 2, 8)>, <6, (7, 2, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (7, 3, 5)>, <9, (4, 1, 0)>
