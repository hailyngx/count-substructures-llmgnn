Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (7, 29) (7, 14) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 18) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 17) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 11) (27, 28) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 18) (29, 7) (29, 28) (21, 9) (21, 16) (21, 22) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 19) (17, 9) (20, 3) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 23) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 14) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 10) (24, 23) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 2) (5, 4) (5, 25) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 0) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 22) (14, 10) (22, 21) (22, 14) (22, 0) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 10) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 22) (10, 24) (10, 14) (10, 2) (23, 20) (23, 24) (23, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges for each node to determine the potential centers of the 3-stars.

Node 3 has 4 edges: (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 20)
Node 8 has 3 edges: (8, 13), (8, 15), (8, 12)
Node 9 has 4 edges: (6, 9), (9, 6), (9, 25), (9, 21)
Node 11 has 3 edges: (3, 11), (27, 11), (19, 11)
Node 12 has 4 edges: (8, 12), (13, 12), (12, 27), (12, 18)
Node 13 has 4 edges: (8, 13), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 18)
Node 14 has 4 edges: (7, 14), (18, 14), (14, 22), (14, 10)
Node 16 has 4 edges: (3, 16), (21, 16), (16, 24), (16, 15)
Node 18 has 4 edges: (13, 18), (12, 18), (18, 28), (18, 14)
Node 20 has 4 edges: (3, 20), (6, 20), (20, 2), (20, 23)
Node 24 has 5 edges: (6, 24), (16, 24), (24, 0), (24, 10), (24, 23)
Node 25 has 4 edges: (9, 25), (25, 5), (25, 23), (25, 2)
Node 27 has 3 edges: (27, 12), (27, 11), (27, 28)
Node 28 has 3 edges: (27, 28), (28, 27), (28, 29)

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<3, (1, 11, 20)>
<8, (13, 15, 12)>
<9, (6, 25, 21)>
<12, (13, 27, 18)>
<13, (8, 12, 18)>
<14, (7, 18, 22)>
<16, (3, 21, 24)>
<18, (13, 28, 14)>
<20, (3, 6, 2)>
<24, (6, 16, 23)>
<25, (9, 5, 23)>
<27, (12, 11, 28)>
<28, (27, 29, 18)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars found in the given graph, so the final answer is [13].
