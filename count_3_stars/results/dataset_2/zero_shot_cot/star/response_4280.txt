Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

<1, (10, 6, 0)>
<3, (11, 7, 13)>
<8, (14, 1, 0)>
<5, (9, 12, 10)>
