Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 17) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (7, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 5) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 19) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures that exist in the graph. 

First, let's check each node to see how many edges it has. 

- Node 0: 4 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 2 edges
- Node 3: 1 edge
- Node 4: 2 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 2 edges
- Node 7: 1 edge
- Node 8: 5 edges
- Node 9: 3 edges
- Node 10: 4 edges
- Node 11: 4 edges
- Node 12: 3 edges
- Node 13: 4 edges
- Node 14: 5 edges
- Node 15: 2 edges
- Node 16: 3 edges
- Node 17: 3 edges
- Node 18: 2 edges
- Node 19: 4 edges

Nodes with 3 or more edges are potential central nodes of 3-stars. Let's inspect these nodes further.

- Node 8: (8, 13, 14, 5, 3)
    - <8, (13, 14, 5)>
- Node 13: (13, 8, 16, 19, 14)
    - <13, (8, 16, 19)>
    - <13, (8, 14, 19)>
- Node 14: (14, 8, 13, 6, 9, 19)
    - <14, (8, 13, 6)>
    - <14, (8, 13, 9)>
    - <14, (8, 13, 19)>
    
Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph: <8, (13, 14, 5)>, <13, (8, 16, 19)>, <13, (8, 14, 19)>, <14, (8, 13, 6)>, <14, (8, 13, 9)>.
