Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be obtained by counting the number of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star.
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 5: <5, (1, 4, 0)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 9: <9, (3, 7, 0)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 6: <6, (1, 7, 2)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 3)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 3: <3, (9, 1, X)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 4: <4, (5, 7, 8)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 7: <7, (9, 6, 4)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 8: <8, (9, 4, 0)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 0: <0, (5, 9, 7)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 2: <2, (5, 4, 0)> (1 unique 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
