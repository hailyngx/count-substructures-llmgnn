Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 2) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (19, 4) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 11) (7, 17) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 15) (12, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. A central node in a 3-star graph is a node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the nodes that satisfy this condition: 

- Node 0 is connected to 4, 14, 15, and 16 (degree = 4).
- Node 1 is connected to 2, 10, and 17 (degree = 3).
- Node 2 is connected to 1, 4, 13, and 14 (degree = 4).
- Node 4 is connected to 2, 8, 11, and 19 (degree = 4).
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 3, 12, and 18 (degree = 4).
- Node 8 is connected to 4, 10, 11, and 13 (degree = 4).
- Node 9 is connected to 10, 14, 16, and 18 (degree = 4).
- Node 11 is connected to 3, 4, 7, and 8 (degree = 4).
- Node 13 is connected to 2, 5, 8, and 13 (degree = 4).
- Node 14 is connected to 0, 2, 9, and 14 (degree = 4).
- Node 16 is connected to 0, 5, 9, and 19 (degree = 4).
- Node 17 is connected to 1 and 7 (degree = 2).
- Node 18 is connected to 6 and 9 (degree = 2).
- Node 19 is connected to 4 and 16 (degree = 2).

Based on the analysis above, the central nodes are: 1, 17, 18, and 19.

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:

For central node 1:
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 10 is connected to node 1.
- Node 17 is connected to node 1.

For central node 17:
- Node 1 is connected to node 17.
- Node 7 is connected to node 17.

For central node 18:
- Node 6 is connected to node 18.
- Node 9 is connected to node 18.

For central node 19:
- Node 4 is connected to node 19.
- Node 16 is connected to node 19.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 10, 17)>
<17, (1, 7)>
<18, (6, 9)>
<19, (4, 16)>
