Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 24) (6, 25) (6, 16) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 15) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (23, 13) (10, 15) (10, 24) (11, 3) (11, 4) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 12) (25, 6) (25, 1) (25, 14) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 1) (20, 23) (20, 0) (20, 2) (4, 22) (4, 11) (19, 8) (19, 15) (7, 5) (7, 18) (21, 26) (21, 16) (15, 22) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 28) (13, 23) (13, 17) (13, 2) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 27) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 27) (16, 6) (16, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (27, 17) (27, 8) (27, 1) (2, 20) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (24, 6) (24, 10) (29, 18) (29, 8) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 0) (1, 27) (28, 15) (28, 17) (14, 18) (14, 25) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
The task is to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For each node, check if there are exactly 3 edges connected to it. If so, it is the center of a potential 3-star.

2. Once we identify the potential centers, check whether each connected node to the center has exactly one edge connecting it to the center.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 17, 20)>
<1, (0, 25, 5)>
<2, (12, 13, 20)>
<3, (12, 11, 22)>
<4, (11, 22, 4)>
<5, (1, 7, 25)>
<6, (9, 26, 16)>
<7, (5, 18, 7)>
<8, (19, 27, 29)>
<9, (26, 6, 1)>
<10, (15, 24, 10)>
<11, (3, 4, 12)>
<12, (3, 2, 14)>
<13, (2, 17, 23)>
<14, (12, 16, 25)>
<15, (19, 22, 28)>
<16, (6, 21, 14)>
<17, (28, 27, 13)>
<18, (7, 29, 14)>
<19, (15, 8, 8)>
<20, (2, 0, 23)>
<21, (16, 26, 21)>
<22, (4, 15, 23)>
<23, (13, 20, 22)>
<24, (10, 25, 24)>
<25, (14, 24, 6)>
<26, (21, 9, 26)>
<27, (17, 8, 1)>
<28, (15, 17, 28)>
<29, (8, 18, 29)>

Now that we have listed all the unique 3-stars, we count them to find the final answer:

[30]
