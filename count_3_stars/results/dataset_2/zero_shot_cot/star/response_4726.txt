Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 10) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <8, (13, 5, 10)>
2. <13, (8, 5, 2)>
3. <5, (8, 13, 11)>
4. <0, (5, 7, 1)>
5. <7, (13, 5, 0)>
6. <1, (8, 0, None)>
7. <6, (3, 2, 11)>
8. <2, (13, 7, 6)>
9. <12, (8, 6, 2)>
10. <11, (5, 7, 6)>
11. <14, (11, 9, 3)>
12. <10, (8, 3, 4)>
13. <3, (5, 6, 14)>
14. <9, (7, 2, 14)>
15. <4, (11, 10, None)>

Finally, count the number of 3-stars: [15]
