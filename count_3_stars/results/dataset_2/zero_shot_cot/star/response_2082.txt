Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify which nodes have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Those nodes can be potential centers of the 3-stars.
   - Node 5 and Node 3 satisfy this criteria.

2. For each potential center node, check if the nodes connected to it could form a 3-star.
   - For Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 6), and (5, 7) can form a 3-star with Node 5 as the center.
     - <5, (2, 3, 6)>
     - <5, (2, 3, 7)>
     - <5, (2, 6, 7)>
     - <5, (3, 6, 7)>
   - For Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), and (3, 9) can form 3-stars with Node 3 as the center.
     - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
     - <3, (5, 6, 8)>
     - <3, (5, 6, 9)>
     - <3, (5, 7, 8)>
     - <3, (5, 7, 9)>

3. Count the total unique 3-stars found.
   - Total unique 3-stars: 7

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
