Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 15) (9, 5) (1, 13) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 19) (18, 17) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 15) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 18) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <11, (16, 19, 14)>
2. <16, (11, 19, 5)>
3. <5, (9, 17, 15)>
4. <9, (5, 17, 15)>
5. <1, (13, -1, -1)>
6. <3, (4, -1, -1)>
7. <4, (3, 8, 12)>
8. <8, (4, 2, 7)>
9. <7, (8, 12, 14)>
10. <12, (4, 8, 0)>
11. <2, (8, 6, -1)>
12. <0, (12, 6, -1)>
13. <14, (11, 7, 19)>
14. <18, (17, -1, -1)>
15. <19, (11, 16, 14)>
16. <6, (4, 2, 0)>
17. <15, (5, 7, 6)>
18. <10, (12, 2, 19)>
19. <13, (1, 15, -1)>
20. <17, (11, 5, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [20]
