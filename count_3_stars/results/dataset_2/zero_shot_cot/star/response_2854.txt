Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 28) (9, 16) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 8) (3, 17) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 17) (1, 26) (1, 13) (10, 11) (10, 22) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 27) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 29) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 6) (20, 12) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 16) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 29) (21, 4) (21, 18) (18, 26) (18, 21) (18, 23) (18, 6) (25, 9) (25, 27) (25, 6) (5, 26) (5, 10) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 29) (19, 24) (2, 23) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 4) (22, 10) (22, 14) (22, 16) (23, 18) (23, 2) (23, 7) (8, 26) (8, 29) (24, 20) (24, 19) (24, 7) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 24) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 19) (29, 8) (13, 1) (13, 28) (16, 9) (16, 20) (16, 22) (28, 9) (28, 13) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 25) (4, 14) (4, 21) (4, 17) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 9 with leaves 25, 15, 28 <9, (25, 15, 28)>
2. Node 26 with leaves 1, 18, 5 <26, (1, 18, 5)>
3. Node 11 with leaves 10, 19, 27 <11, (10, 19, 27)>
4. Node 12 with leaves 27, 20, 29 <12, (27, 20, 29)>
5. Node 20 with leaves 12, 24, 5 <20, (12, 24, 5)>
6. Node 14 with leaves 0, 22, 29 <14, (0, 22, 29)>
7. Node 18 with leaves 26, 21, 23 <18, (26, 21, 23)>
8. Node 10 (this is a duplicate from before) with leaves 11, 22, 5 <10, (11, 22, 5)>
9. Node 27 (this is a duplicate from before) with leaves 11, 12, 25 <27, (11, 12, 25)>
10. Node 5 with leaves 26, 10, 20 <5, (26, 10, 20)>
11. Node 19 with leaves 11, 29, 24 <19, (11, 29, 24)>
12. Node 17 with leaves 3, 15, 2 <17, (3, 15, 2)>
13. Node 22 with leaves 10, 14, 16 <22, (10, 14, 16)>
14. Node 23 with leaves 18, 2, 7 <23, (18, 2, 7)>
15. Node 24 with leaves 20, 19, 7 <24, (20, 19, 7)>
16. Node 29 with leaves 12, 14, 19 <29, (12, 14, 19)>
17. Node 13 with leaves 1, 28, (Not a 3-star)
18. Node 16 with leaves 9, 20, 22 <16, (9, 20, 22)>
19. Node 28 with leaves 9, 13, (Not a 3-star)
20. Node 6 with leaves 27, 0, 18 <6, (27, 0, 18)>
21. Node 4 with leaves 14, 21, 17 <4, (14, 21, 17)>

There are 21 unique 3-stars in total.
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
