Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 16) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 25) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 6) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 25) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 23) (3, 19) (26, 18) (26, 12) (6, 8) (6, 27) (24, 29) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 23) (29, 24) (29, 1) (0, 18) (0, 3) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 14) (25, 21) (25, 22) (20, 27) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 28) (19, 2) (19, 3) (27, 21) (27, 6) (27, 20) (12, 21) (12, 22) (12, 26) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 28) (13, 14) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 22) (14, 5) (14, 16) (14, 13) (4, 10) (4, 20) (15, 17) (23, 7) (23, 3) (23, 1) (23, 20) (28, 20) (28, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are in 3-star formations. 
A 3-star formation will have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Based on the given edges, we can identify the following potential 3-star formations:
1. Node 5 with nodes 1, 8, 9
2. Node 9 with nodes 5, 16, 22
3. Node 3 with nodes 0, 16, 21
4. Node 21 with nodes 3, 7, 27
5. Node 17 with nodes 7, 10, 11
6. Node 8 with nodes 2, 5, 18
7. Node 22 with nodes 9, 11, 25
8. Node 16 with nodes 3, 9, 14
9. Node 25 with nodes 12, 21, 22
10. Node 20 with nodes 4, 23, 27
11. Node 13 with nodes 2, 12, 14
12. Node 29 with nodes 1, 24, 29
13. Node 18 with nodes 2, 8, 26
14. Node 12 with nodes 13, 21, 26
15. Node 14 with nodes 5, 13, 16
16. Node 28 with nodes 13, 20, 28

Thus, we have 16 unique 3-star formations in this graph.

[The number of 3-stars: <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 16, 22)>, <3, (0, 16, 21)>, <21, (3, 7, 27)>, <17, (7, 10, 11)>, <8, (2, 5, 18)>, <22, (9, 11, 25)>, <16, (3, 9, 14)>, <25, (12, 21, 22)>, <20, (4, 23, 27)>, <13, (2, 12, 14)>, <29, (1, 24, 29)>, <18, (2, 8, 26)>, <12, (13, 21, 26)>, <14, (5, 13, 16)>, <28, (13, 20, 28)>]
