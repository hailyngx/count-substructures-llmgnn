Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 15) (29, 14) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 15) (22, 17) (0, 1) (27, 12) (12, 27) (12, 21) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 28) (1, 0) (1, 26) (1, 25) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 10) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 10) (7, 19) (7, 3) (16, 19) (16, 21) (16, 6) (21, 12) (21, 16) (21, 11) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 10) (4, 25) (4, 6) (23, 18) (23, 6) (23, 24) (9, 28) (25, 1) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 28) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 3) (28, 20) (28, 9) (28, 25) (5, 10) (5, 3) (5, 25) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 21) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 15) (15, 29) (15, 22) (15, 6) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <2, (29, 13, 24)>
2. <29, (2, 17, 8)>
3. <18, (22, 23, 20)>
4. <22, (18, 15, 17)>
5. <1, (0, 26, 25)>
6. <26, (1, 14, 10)>
7. <17, (29, 22, 20)>
8. <19, (8, 7, 16)>
9. <8, (29, 19, 11)>
10. <14, (29, 26, 24)>
11. <7, (19, 3, -)>
12. <16, (19, 21, 6)>
13. <21, (12, 16, 11)>
14. <10, (26, 14, 4)>
15. <3, (7, 13, 5)>
16. <4, (10, 25, 6)>
17. <23, (18, 6, 24)>
18. <25, (1, 4, 5)>
19. <13, (2, 18, 3)>
20. <28, (20, 9, 25)>
21. <5, (10, 3, 25)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [21]
