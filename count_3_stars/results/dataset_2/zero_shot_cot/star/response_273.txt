Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5 with leaves 9, 1, 4
2. Node 9 with leaves 5, 8, 3
3. Node 4 with leaves 5, 7, 8
4. Node 7 with leaves 9, 4, 0
5. Node 1 with leaves 5, 7, 2
6. Node 3 with leaves 9, 4, 0
7. Node 8 with leaves 9, 4, 2
8. Node 6 with leaves 4, 0
9. Node 2 with leaves 7, 1, 8
10. Node 0 with leaves 4, 7, 3, 8, 6

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<1, (5, 7, 2)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<6, (4, 0)>
<2, (7, 1, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 3, 8, 6)>
