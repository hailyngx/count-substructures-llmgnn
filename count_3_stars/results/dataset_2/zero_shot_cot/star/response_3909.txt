Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, list out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 4, 8
- Node 1: 9, 6, 3
- Node 2: 9, 6, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 9, 1, 2, 8
- Node 4: 9, 7, 8, 0, 2
- Node 5: 9, 0
- Node 6: 9, 1, 7, 2
- Node 7: 6, 4, 2
- Node 8: 3, 4, 2, 0
- Node 9: 5, 0, 6, 4, 2, 1, 3

Next, let's identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connecting to them. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 9)>
- <6, (1, 2, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 2)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9.
