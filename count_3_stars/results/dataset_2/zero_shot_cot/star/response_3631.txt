Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, we note that each node must be part of a 3-star graph as the center. We need to identify the 3-star graphs in the given data. 

Let's go through the edges and list all possible 3-stars. 

1. For node 0: 
   - Potential 3-star: <0, (1, 2, 9)>
   
2. For node 1: 
   - Potential 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
   
3. For node 2: 
   - Potential 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>

4. For node 3: 
   - Potential 3-star: <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>
   
5. For node 4: 
   - Potential 3-star: <4, (6, 8, 9)>
   
6. For node 5:
   - No 3-star centered around node 5.
   
7. For node 6: 
   - Potential 3-star: <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>

8. For node 7: 
   - Potential 3-star: <7, (1, 2, 8)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>
   
9. For node 8: 
   - Potential 3-star: <8, (1, 2, 5)>

10. For node 9: 
   - No 3-star centered around node 9.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars found in the given graph. 

The total number of 3-stars: [11]
Unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (1, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
