Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's begin by listing all unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 2)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars: [10].
