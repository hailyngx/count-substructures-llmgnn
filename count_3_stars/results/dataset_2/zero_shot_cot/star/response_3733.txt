Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 20) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 29) (16, 10) (1, 16) (1, 21) (1, 24) (1, 13) (21, 1) (21, 15) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 23) (6, 0) (28, 29) (28, 26) (29, 16) (29, 28) (29, 17) (17, 29) (17, 23) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 0) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 4) (9, 22) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 22) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 7) (20, 11) (20, 3) (20, 18) (25, 12) (25, 24) (14, 26) (14, 24) (12, 16) (12, 25) (12, 3) (12, 8) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 1) (24, 25) (24, 14) (0, 6) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 20) (3, 12) (3, 0) (15, 21) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 23) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 27) (10, 2) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 13) (23, 6) (23, 17) (23, 19) (18, 20) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 13) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the central nodes with exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. Let's list them out:

<11, (24, 19, 20)>
<16, (12, 1, 29)>
<1, (16, 21, 24)>
<21, (1, 15, 20)>
<5, (6, 4, 10)>
<6, (5, 2, 23)>
<29, (16, 28, 17)>
<17, (29, 23, 17)>
<22, (9, 4, 0)>
<26, (28, 14, 4)>
<4, (5, 22, 26)>
<27, (4, 10, 7)>
<20, (11, 3, 18)>
<12, (16, 25, 3)>
<24, (11, 1, 25)>
<0, (6, 22, 3)>
<3, (20, 12, 0)>
<15, (21, 19, 18)>
<19, (11, 15, 23)>
<10, (16, 5, 27)>
<7, (9, 27, 13)>
<23, (6, 17, 19)>
<18, (20, 0, 15)>
<13, (1, 7, 18)>

Now count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [24].
