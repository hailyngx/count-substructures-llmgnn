Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 since it has degree 4:
- Nodes connected to node 5: 1, 2, 7, 8

Now, we will check the neighboring nodes of node 1, node 3, and node 7 to see if they form 3-stars:
1. Node 1:
- Nodes connected to node 1: 0, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1 with its neighbors form the following 3-stars:
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>

2. Node 3:
- Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3 with its neighbors form the following 3-stars:
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>

3. Node 7:
- Nodes connected to node 7: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 7 with its neighbors form the following 3-stars:
<7, (3, 4, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: 7
