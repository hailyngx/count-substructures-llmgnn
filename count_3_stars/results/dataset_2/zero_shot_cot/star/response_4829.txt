Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern.

Checking each node in the graph:
- Node 0 has 4 edges connected to it: (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 8), (0, 3), which means it is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 edges connected to it: (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), which means it is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected to it: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3), which forms a 3-star with central node 2 and leaves 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 3 has 5 edges connected to it, which means it is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected to it: (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), which means it is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 5 has 6 edges connected to it, which means it is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected to it: (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 4), which means it is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 6 edges connected to it, which means it is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 edges connected to it: (8, 9), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 7), which means it is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 edges connected to it, which means it is not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, there is only 1 unique 3-star in the given graph: <2, (0, 1, 3)>.

The final answer is [1].
