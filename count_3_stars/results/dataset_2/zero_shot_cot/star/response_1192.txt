Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star.

Nodes with number of edges connecting to them:
- Node 0: 4 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 5 edges
- Node 3: 5 edges
- Node 4: 3 edges
- Node 5: 5 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 2 edges
- Node 8: 4 edges
- Node 9: 4 edges

Now, we look for 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 0)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
