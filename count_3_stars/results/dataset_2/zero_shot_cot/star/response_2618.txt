Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 24) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 13) (9, 19) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 24) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 21) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 1) (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 19) (0, 15) (0, 6) (20, 21) (20, 4) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 26) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 11) (8, 7) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 28) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 21) (21, 6) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 11) (19, 9) (19, 29) (26, 18) (26, 27) (26, 17) (17, 23) (17, 26) (17, 16) (14, 18) (14, 22) (16, 17) (16, 4) (7, 8) (7, 23) (7, 10) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 28) (24, 15) (24, 18) (4, 20) (4, 16) (4, 28) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given edges, the 3-stars in the graph can be listed as follows:
<3, (1, 13, 25)>
<15, (0, 8, 25)>
<6, (0, 9, 21)>
<9, (6, 13, 22)>
<18, (14, 24, 26)>
<22, (9, 21, 25)>
<25, (1, 3, 15)>
<1, (2, 3, 25)>
<2, (12, 29, 1)>
<29, (2, 19, 29)>
<0, (6, 15, 0)>
<20, (4, 21, 20)>
<12, (2, 13, 8)>
<27, (12, 26, 27)>
<8, (12, 15, 8)>
<23, (7, 17, 23)>
<10, (7, 11, 10)>
<11, (8, 21, 11)>
<19, (9, 29, 19)>
<26, (17, 18, 26)>
<17, (16, 23, 26)>
<14, (18, 22, 14)>
<16, (4, 17, 16)>
<7, (10, 23, 7)>
<28, (4, 13, 28)>

Now, we need to count these unique 3-stars. 

The final count of 3-stars in the given graph is: [24]
