Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 0)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 3)>
<9, (2, 6, 3)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
