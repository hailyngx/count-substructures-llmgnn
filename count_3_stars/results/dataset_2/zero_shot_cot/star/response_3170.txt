Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (6, 2) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. From the given edges, we can identify the 3-star patterns as follows:
   - <5, (9, 2, 8)>
   - <9, (5, 4, 14)>
   - <4, (9, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (9, 4, 11)>
   - <3, (9, 4, 11)>
   - <8, (5, 4, 14)>
   - <13, (1, 3, 0)>
   - <11, (2, 1, 3)>
   - <2, (5, 3, 11)>
   - <14, (8, 9, 12)>
   - <6, (2, 10, 0)>
   - <10, (9, 1, 12)>
   - <12, (10, 14, 0)>
   
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars: 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
