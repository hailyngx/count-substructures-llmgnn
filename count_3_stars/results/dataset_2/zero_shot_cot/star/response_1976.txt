Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the potential 3-stars:  
<5, (9, 1, 4)>  
<9, (5, 6, 2)>  
<4, (5, 7, 8)>  
<7, (9, 4, 0)>  
<6, (9, 4, 3)>  
<1, (5, 3, -1)>  (This is not a valid 3-star as node -1 is not part of the graph)  
<3, (5, 9, 6)>  
<8, (4, 7, 2)>  
<2, (9, 6, 3)>  
<0, (9, 4, 7)>  

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:  
[9]
