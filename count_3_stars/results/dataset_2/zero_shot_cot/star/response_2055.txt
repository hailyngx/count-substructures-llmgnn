Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaf nodes.

1. Central node 5:
   <5, (9, 6, 4)>
   <5, (9, 4, 0)>
   <5, (9, 4, 7)>

2. Central node 9:
   <9, (5, 4, 2)>
   <9, (5, 4, 3)>

3. Central node 4:
   <4, (5, 9, 3)>
   <4, (5, 3, 0)>
   <4, (5, 0, 8)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [8].
