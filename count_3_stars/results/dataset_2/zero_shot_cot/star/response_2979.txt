Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 21) (11, 15) (11, 25) (16, 19) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 26) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 12) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 27) (0, 3) (0, 27) (0, 19) (27, 6) (27, 9) (27, 0) (20, 1) (20, 23) (25, 11) (25, 7) (25, 14) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 1) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 22) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 29) (7, 25) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (17, 5) (17, 2) (29, 4) (29, 19) (21, 11) (21, 28) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 18) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 26) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 2) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 14) (2, 17) (2, 26) (2, 13) (8, 7) (8, 28) (8, 24) (1, 20) (1, 22) (1, 7) (10, 25) (10, 13) (12, 6) (5, 17) (14, 25) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 21) (14, 24) (13, 2) (13, 10) (18, 3) (18, 28) 

Response:
The center nodes of the 3-stars can be found by identifying nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here they are:

- Nodes 3, 6, 9, 7, 1, 22, 26, 24, and 2.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- <3, (15, 6, 0)>
- <6, (3, 9, 27)>
- <9, (6, 4, 27)>
- <7, (25, 4, 1)>
- <1, (20, 22, 7)>
- <22, (23, 14, 1)>
- <26, (15, 19, 24)>
- <24, (3, 26, 8)>
- <2, (17, 26, 13)>

Therefore, there are 9 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
