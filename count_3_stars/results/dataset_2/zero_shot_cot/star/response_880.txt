Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 23) (20, 4) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 28) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 9) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 2) (1, 8) (1, 26) (26, 25) (26, 1) (26, 17) (18, 27) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 16) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 21) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (9, 27) (9, 29) (29, 18) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 24) (21, 10) (21, 17) (21, 11) (2, 25) (2, 23) (2, 3) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 14) (11, 24) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 28) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 7) (3, 20) (3, 2) (3, 16) (0, 18) (0, 19) (6, 29) (6, 15) (6, 16) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (28, 20) (28, 14) (15, 5) (15, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to the center node in the 3-star configurations. We'll list all possible 3-stars in the graph and then count the unique ones to find the total number of 3-stars.

The nodes that are connected to the center node (4) are: 5, 7, and 20.

Possible 3-stars:
- <4, (5, 7, 20)>
- <7, (4, 3, 23)>
- <20, (4, 25, 3)>
- <25, (20, 26, 2)>
- <8, (13, 19, 1)>
- <13, (8, - , -)> (Cannot form a 3-star as it only has 2 connected nodes)
- <12, (27, 19, 14)>
- <27, (12, 18, 9)>
- <23, (7, 18, 2)>
- <1, (8, 26, -)> (Cannot form a 3-star as it only has 2 connected nodes)
- <26, (25, 1, 17)>
- <18, (27, 23, 0)>
- <10, (17, 21, 16)>
- <5, (4, 19, 15)>
- <19, (8, 12, 5)>
- <9, (27, 29, -)> (Cannot form a 3-star as it only has 2 connected nodes)
- <29, (18, 9, 24)>
- <21, (10, 17, 11)>
- <2, (25, 23, 3)>
- <11, (8, 21, 24)>
- <14, (12, 11, 28)>
- <24, (7, 29, 11)>
- <3, (7, 20, 2)>
- <0, (18, 19, -)> (Cannot form a 3-star as it only has 2 connected nodes)
- <6, (29, 15, 16)>
- <16, (20, 10, 3)>
- <28, (20, 14, -)> (Cannot form a 3-star as it only has 2 connected nodes>
- <15, (5, 6, -)> (Cannot form a 3-star as it only has 2 connected nodes)

Count of unique 3-stars: [18]
