Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 10) (15, 0) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 6) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 27) (7, 4) (7, 9) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 27) (3, 0) (3, 26) (20, 17) (20, 28) (6, 27) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 8) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 18) (9, 7) (9, 22) (22, 9) (22, 17) (22, 12) (5, 29) (5, 11) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 11) (24, 4) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 14) (24, 10) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 2) (26, 21) (0, 15) (0, 3) (10, 15) (10, 24) (10, 25) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 16) (17, 1) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 23) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 19) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 12) (12, 22) (12, 2) (18, 28) (18, 23) (19, 16) (19, 29) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 24) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 18) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 29) (14, 1) (14, 24) (29, 5) (29, 19) (29, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph: 

1. We observe the edges connecting nodes to identify 3-stars.
2. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes that satisfy this condition. 
3. We then list out the unique 3-stars found.

Let's begin:

There are 3-stars with the following configurations:
<15, (0, 10, 27)>
<27, (3, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 11, 24)>
<7, (4, 9, 27)>
<1, (8, 14, 17)>
<3, (0, 26, 27)>
<6, (8, 21, 28)>
<9, (7, 22, 27)>
<22, (12, 17, 9)>
<5, (11, 13, 29)>
<13, (2, 11, 25)>
<24, (10, 14, 26)>
<26, (2, 3, 24)>
<0, (3, 10, 15)>
<10, (15, 24, 25)>
<21, (6, 16, 26)>
<17, (1, 20, 22)>
<16, (4, 19, 21)>
<2, (12, 13, 26)>
<12, (2, 22, 13)>
<18, (23, 28, 18)>
<19, (16, 29, 19)>
<11, (4, 13, 25)>
<23, (17, 18, 23)>
<25, (10, 11, 13)>
<8, (1, 14, 29)>
<14, (1, 24, 8)>
<29, (5, 8, 19)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [29]
