Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 10) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 18) (26, 21) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 20) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (18, 26) (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 12) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 24) (23, 25) (23, 6) (23, 13) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 4) (20, 0) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 21) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 19) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 5) (29, 0) (29, 14) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 6) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 3) (12, 4) (12, 22) (12, 25) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 27) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 11) (2, 0) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 17) (24, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 29) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 3) (27, 1) (27, 28) (25, 23) (25, 12) (13, 11) (13, 23) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

[<2, (4, 7, 22)>, <4, (7, 2, 20)>, <7, (4, 6, 14)>, <9, (10, 7, 26)>, <11, (10, 19, 24)>, <14, (7, 15, 29)>, <15, (14, 17, 21)>, <17, (15, 24, 5)>, <19, (1, 22, 11)>, <20, (0, 2, 4)>, <21, (3, 15, 26)>, <22, (19, 12, 2)>, <23, (6, 13, 25)>, <24, (17, 3, 11)>, <26, (9, 21, 18)>, <27, (1, 28, 27)>, <28, (16, 27, 28)>, <29, (0, 14, 29)>]

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
