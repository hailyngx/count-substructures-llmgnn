Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 3) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Mapping out the connections between nodes in a clearer format helps in identifying the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 11, 13, 14
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 12
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 13, 14
- Node 3: Connected to node 2
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 8, 10
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 11
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 5, 11, 12, 13
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 8, 10, 11, 12
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 12
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 11, 12, 14
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 12, 14
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, 9, 13
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 11
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 9, 10

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by identifying the unique patterns:

<0, (5, 11, 13)>
<0, (5, 13, 14)>
<1, (4, 12, 5)>
<2, (3, 5, 13)>
<2, (3, 13, 2)>
<4, (1, 8, 10)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 13)>
<5, (1, 11, 6)>
<6, (5, 11, 13)>
<6, (5, 12, 7)>
<7, (8, 10, 12)>
<9, (11, 12, 14)>
<10, (4, 7, 12)>
<11, (0, 5, 6)>
<11, (0, 9, 13)>
<11, (7, 12, 9)>
<12, (6, 8, 7)>
<13, (0, 2, 11)>
<14, (0, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
