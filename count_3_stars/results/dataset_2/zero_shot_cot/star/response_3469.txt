Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 16) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 15) (8, 14) (17, 1) (17, 7) (17, 4) (5, 15) (5, 2) (19, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Each such node will be the center of a 3-star.

By examining the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<3, (15, 11, 6)>
<15, (3, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 9, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 19)>
<2, (9, 1, 5)>
<17, (1, 7, 4)>
<10, (4, 16, 11)>
<1, (17, 2, 0)>
<11, (3, 6, 4)>
<4, (10, 17, 11)>
<8, (15, 14, 8)>
<5, (15, 2, 5)>
<12, (16, 12, 0)>
<18, (14, 0, 18)>
<source node 13 does not form a 3-star>
<0, (2, 18, 13)>
<16, (10, 12, 0)>
<14, (18, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
