Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 edges connected to nodes 9, 2, 1, and 7.
- Node 9 has 5 edges connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 2, and 1.
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected to nodes 9, 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 1 has 4 edges connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected to nodes 9, 6, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 has 4 edges connected to nodes 1, 4, 2, and 0.
- Node 2 has 5 edges connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 3, and 8.
- Node 0 has 3 edges connected to nodes 3, 8, and 7.
- Node 3 has 3 edges connected to nodes 0, 4, and 2.
- Node 7 has 3 edges connected to nodes 5, 9, and 0.

It seems there are no 3-stars in this graph based on the given information. Therefore, the count of 3-stars is [0].
