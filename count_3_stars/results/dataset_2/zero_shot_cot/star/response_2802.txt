Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0: (4, 7, 10)
2. Node 1: (4, 13, 14)
3. Node 2: (5, 12, 13)
4. Node 3: (6, 13, 4)
5. Node 4: (0, 7, 11)
6. Node 7: (4, 7, 14)
7. Node 10: (0, 7, 10)
8. Node 13: (8, 13, 3)
9. Node 14: (9, 11, 14)

Count of 3-stars: [9]
