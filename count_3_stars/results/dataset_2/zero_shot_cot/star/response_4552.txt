Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 24) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 19) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 11) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 16) (27, 23) (2, 9) (2, 25) (18, 5) (18, 20) (18, 8) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 28) (6, 1) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 13) (28, 5) (13, 28) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 29) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 23) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 29) (8, 18) (8, 9) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (16, 14) (16, 27) (16, 21) (24, 14) (24, 23) (24, 20) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 15) (22, 11) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 15) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 4) (4, 22) (4, 1) (4, 15) (29, 26) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 25) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 22) (15, 4) (15, 23) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 24) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 24) (23, 15) (5, 18) (5, 28) (25, 2) (25, 21) (25, 29) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-star structures. 

First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges (leaves of the star). 
From the given edges:
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 14, 6, 28, and 4.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 11, 2, and 8.
- Node 16 has edges with nodes 14, 27, and 21.
- Node 22 has edges with nodes 11, 19, and 4.
- Node 26 has edges with nodes 15, 20, and 29.

Therefore, the identified nodes are: 1, 9, 16, 22, 26.

Next, we will list the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (14, 6, 28)>
<9, (11, 2, 8)>
<16, (14, 27, 21)>
<22, (11, 19, 4)>
<26, (15, 20, 29)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
