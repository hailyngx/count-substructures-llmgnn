Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaf nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<9, (5, 11, 10)>
<8, (13, 10, 11)>
<13, (5, 8, 3)>
<4, (5, 12, 1)>
<7, (8, 3, 2)>
<12, (9, 4, 0)>
<2, (4, 10, 3)>
<6, (5, 14, 10)>
<0, (12, 14, 10)>
<14, (13, 6, 0)>
<10, (9, 8, 2)>
<11, (9, 8, 12)>
<3, (13, 7, 2)>
<1, (13, 4, -)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
