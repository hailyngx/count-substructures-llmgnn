Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (4, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (16, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes would serve as potential centers for 3-stars. The nodes with three edges are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 16.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. For center node 0: (0, 10, 15), (0, 10, 14), (0, 12, 16), (0, 12, 17), (0, 12, 2), (0, 12, 4).
2. For center node 1: (1, 10, 14), (1, 10, 15), (1, 13, 19).
3. For center node 3: (3, 9, 2).
4. For center node 4: (4, 12, 0).
5. For center node 5: (5, 0, 17), (5, 11, 17), (5, 11, 0).
6. For center node 7: (7, 2, 6).
7. For center node 8: (8, 10, 13).
8. For center node 16: (16, 12, 0).

Therefore, we have found a total of [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The list of unique 3-stars is <0, (10, 15, 14)>, <0, (12, 16, 17)>, <0, (12, 2, 4)>, <1, (10, 14, 15)>, <1, (13, 19)>, <3, (9, 2)>, <4, (12, 0)>, <5, (0, 17, 11)>, <7, (2, 6)>, and <8, (10, 13)>.
