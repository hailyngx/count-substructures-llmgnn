Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 29) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 14) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 22) (17, 18) (0, 7) (0, 20) (0, 5) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 19) (24, 2) (26, 24) (26, 2) (26, 25) (27, 4) (27, 25) (16, 1) (16, 25) (28, 22) (28, 2) (28, 23) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 14) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 13) (25, 29) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 28) (2, 24) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 9) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 24) (19, 15) (19, 9) (5, 0) (5, 20) (23, 28) (23, 29) (3, 20) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 23) (29, 14) (9, 21) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 11) (1, 24) (1, 16) (1, 18) (13, 25) (13, 15) (13, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 21) (14, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, indicating the presence of 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 neighbors: {4, 7, 10, 17, 28, 9, 1, 13, 18, 11, 6, 14}

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<4, (27, 22, 29)>
<7, (0, 29, 20)>
<10, (21, 14, 9)>
<17, (22, 18, 28)>
<28, (22, 2, 23)>
<9, (21, 12, 19)>
<1, (24, 16, 18)>
<13, (25, 15, 11)>
<18, (17, 1, 6)>
<11, (12, 9, 13)>
<6, (2, 15, 18)>
<14, (7, 10, 21)>
  
Counting the unique 3-stars found: [12].
