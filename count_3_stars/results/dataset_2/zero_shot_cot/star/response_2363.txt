Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 13) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (13, 11) (13, 16) (19, 4) (19, 12) (16, 5) (16, 13) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 9) (18, 1) (18, 15) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of ways we can choose a center node and then selecting 3 nodes to connect to it.

First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0: Connected to 14, 7
- Node 1: Connected to 5, 18, 8
- Node 2: Connected to 10, 9, 4
- Node 3: Connected to 17, 11, 9, 12
- Node 4: Connected to 2, 19, 16, 9
- Node 5: Connected to 1, 6, 8, 16
- Node 6: Connected to 5, 7, 12
- Node 7: Connected to 14, 6, 0, 15
- Node 8: Connected to 1, 5
- Node 9: Connected to 14, 3, 2, 15, 4
- Node 10: Connected to 17, 2
- Node 11: Connected to 3, 13
- Node 12: Connected to 3, 6, 19, 15
- Node 13: Connected to 11, 16
- Node 14: Connected to 0, 7, 9
- Node 15: Connected to 7, 9, 18, 12
- Node 16: Connected to 5, 13, 4
- Node 17: Connected to 10, 3
- Node 18: Connected to 1, 15
- Node 19: Connected to 4, 12

Now, we can count the 3-stars:
- <0, (14, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 18, 8)>
- <2, (10, 9, 4)>
- <3, (17, 11, 9)>
- <4, (2, 19, 16)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 12)>
- <7, (14, 6, 15)>
- <9, (14, 3, 15)>
- <12, (3, 6, 15)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
