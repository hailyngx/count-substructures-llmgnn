Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 12) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the graph. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

First, let's list all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 2, 3, 5, 8.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 6, 8, 11, 13.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 2, 6, 11, 14.
- Node 12 has edges with nodes 2, 5, 8, 11.
- Node 14 has edges with nodes 7, 8, 10, 12.

Next, let's find the 3-star patterns based on the central node and the connected leaves:
- <1, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (6, 11, 13)>
- <4, (6, 8, 13)>
- <4, (6, 11, 8)>
- <7, (2, 11, 14)>
- <7, (6, 11, 14)>
- <7, (2, 6, 14)>
- <12, (2, 5, 11)>
- <12, (2, 8, 11)>
- <12, (5, 8, 11)>
- <14, (7, 10, 12)>
- <14, (8, 10, 12)>
- <14, (7, 8, 12)>
- <14, (7, 10, 14)>

By counting the unique 3-star patterns listed above, we find that there are 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [16].
