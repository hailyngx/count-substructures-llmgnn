Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 4) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 17) (11, 16) (11, 28) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (14, 0) (14, 2) (17, 26) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 19) (1, 26) (1, 3) (1, 24) (1, 22) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 4) (20, 17) (20, 25) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 21) (25, 2) (18, 1) (18, 2) (22, 1) (22, 8) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 6) (27, 29) (27, 28) (27, 7) (2, 16) (2, 14) (2, 25) (2, 18) (0, 16) (0, 14) (15, 3) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 27) (28, 5) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 7) (23, 29) (5, 28) (5, 23) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 13) (13, 19) (13, 21) (13, 29) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 4) (29, 27) (29, 23) (29, 13) (8, 22) (8, 6) (24, 1) (24, 10) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 21) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 23) (10, 20) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 24) (6, 25) (6, 12) (6, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are at the center of a 3-star configuration. Since a 3-star consists of a central node and 3 leaves, we will identify all such configurations. Let's begin by listing the unique 3-star configurations:

<1, (3, 4, 24)>
<16, (0, 2, 12)>
<17, (19, 20, 28)>
<25, (2, 6, 21)>
<26, (1, 7, 9)>
<27, (7, 28, 29)>
<28, (5, 11, 17)>
<29, (13, 23, 27)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique configurations:
