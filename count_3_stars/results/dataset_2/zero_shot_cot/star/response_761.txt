Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to determine the 3-stars.

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8)
3. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 6)
4. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 8)
5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 3)
6. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0)
7. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 0)
8. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3)
9. Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2)
10. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0)

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 0, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
