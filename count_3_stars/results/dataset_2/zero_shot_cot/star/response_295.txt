Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 14) (3, 26) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 25) (13, 9) (13, 23) (10, 1) (11, 24) (11, 12) (11, 29) (12, 11) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 5) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 9) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 26) (20, 27) (20, 0) (20, 25) (5, 12) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 28) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 25) (25, 13) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 9) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 24) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 24) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 21) (14, 3) (14, 9) (24, 11) (24, 22) (24, 19) (24, 17) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 16) (26, 3) (26, 0) (26, 7) (26, 17) (9, 13) (9, 27) (9, 25) (9, 14) (23, 13) (7, 15) (7, 26) (7, 17) (21, 27) (21, 4) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (29, 11) (29, 16) (17, 0) (17, 28) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Observing the given edges, we can see that there is a 3-star <1, (10, 16, 8)>, which has nodes 1, 10, 16 forming a star around node 1.

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [1]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
