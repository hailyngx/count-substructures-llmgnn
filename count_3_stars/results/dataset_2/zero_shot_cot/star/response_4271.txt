Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 5) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 2) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 15 nodes and 60 edges, we need to find the number of 3-stars.

Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (0, 4, 2)>
- <2, (10, 4, 5)>
- <3, (9, 10, 12)>
- <5, (13, 0, 2)>
- <6, (7, 8, 12)>
- <7, (10, 8, 12)>
- <8, (11, 13, 7)>
- <9, (14, 1, 3)>
- <11, (14, 4, 8)>
- <13, (14, 5, 8)>
- <14, (9, 10, 11)>

After finding all the 3-stars, we count the total number, which is [11].
