Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 7) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 15) (4, 3) (18, 9) (18, 1) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 13) (10, 6) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 13) 

Response:
The key to identifying 3-stars in this graph is to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 11: <11, (16, 7, 6)> [1 3-star]
2. Node 16: <16, (11, 3, 9)> [1 3-star]
3. Node 7: <7, (11, 17, 12)> [1 3-star]
4. Node 12: <12, (7, 0, 6)> [1 3-star]
5. Node 0: <0, (12, 2, 2)> [1 3-star]
6. Node 4: <4, (15, 3, 3)> [1 3-star]
7. Node 18: <18, (9, 1, 1)> [1 3-star]
8. Node 13: <13, (17, 15, 10)> [1 3-star]
9. Node 3: <3, (16, 7, 19)> [1 3-star]
10. Node 6: <6, (11, 12, 10)> [1 3-star]
11. Node 1: <1, (12, 18, 8)> [1 3-star]
12. Node 15: <15, (11, 4, 13)> [1 3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
