Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (4, 16) (4, 14) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 15) (19, 18) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (2, 16) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 7) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's identify all the 3-stars present. 

1. Start by looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, list the connected nodes to form a 3-star if possible, with the central node listed first and the connected nodes in parentheses.

Let's go through the graph to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 15, 2. There is a 3-star: <1, (9, 15, 2)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 16, 1, 10. There is a 3-star: <2, (16, 1, 10)>
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 17. There is a 3-star: <3, (7, 12, 17)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 16, 14. There is no 3-star from node 4.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 17, 7, 14. There is a 3-star: <5, (17, 7, 14)>
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 18, 7. There is a 3-star: <6, (8, 18, 7)>
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 17, 1. There is a 3-star: <9, (11, 17, 1)>
8. Node 12 is connected to nodes 17, 10, 3. There is a 3-star: <12, (17, 10, 3)>
9. Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7. There is no 3-star from node 13.
10. Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 2, 15. There is no 3-star from node 16.
11. Node 17 is connected to nodes 11, 5, 9, 12. There is no 3-star from node 17.

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [5]
Unique 3-stars found: <1, (9, 15, 2)>, <2, (16, 1, 10)>, <3, (7, 12, 17)>, <5, (17, 7, 14)>, <6, (8, 18, 7)>
