Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by looking at each node and counting how many 3-stars it is a part of. 

- Node 0: (0, 6, 10) => <0, (6, 10, 5)>
- Node 1: (1, 4, 9), (1, 7, 14) => <1, (4, 9, 13)>, <1, (7, 14, 9)>
- Node 2: (2, 3, 6), (2, 8, 14) => <2, (3, 6, 10)>, <2, (8, 14, 1)>
- Node 3: (3, 2, 10), (3, 7, 13), (3, 9, 12) => <3, (2, 10, 6)>, <3, (7, 13, 1)>, <3, (9, 12, 1)>
- Node 4: (4, 0, 1) => <4, (0, 1, 9)>
- Node 5: (5, 8, 10) => <5, (8, 10, 6)>
- Node 6: (6, 0, 10) => already counted with Node 0
- Node 7: (7, 1, 13), (7, 11, 14) => <7, (1, 13, 9)>, <7, (11, 14, 9)>
- Node 8: (8, 2, 14) => already counted with Node 2
- Node 9: (9, 1, 14) => already counted with Node 1
- Node 10: (10, 5, 6) => already counted with Node 6
- Node 11: (11, 7, 14) => already counted with Node 7
- Node 12: (12, 3, 13) => <12, (3, 13, 7)>
- Node 13: (13, 1, 3) => already counted with Node 3
- Node 14: (14, 1, 8) => already counted with Node 1

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <0, (6, 10, 5)>, <1, (4, 9, 13)>, <1, (7, 14, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 10)>, <2, (8, 14, 1)>, <3, (2, 10, 6)>, <3, (7, 13, 1)>, <3, (9, 12, 1)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (8, 10, 6)>, <7, (1, 13, 9)>, <7, (11, 14, 9)>, <12, (3, 13, 7)>.

Counting them up, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
