Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 11) (1, 9) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 5) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 13) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 18) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

Here are the 3-stars present in the given graph:
<0, (7, 4, 19)>
<1, (9, 17, 5)>
<2, (9, 11, 15)>
<3, (7, 13, 18)>
<5, (17, 10, 14)>
<6, (10, 8, 13)>
<8, (6, 19, 15)>
<9, (2, 1, 11)>
<10, (15, 5, 6)>
<11, (9, 2, 8)>
<12, (16, 14, 13)>
<13, (6, 12, 4)>
<14, (11, 12, 5)>
<15, (10, 18, 8)>
<16, (19, 12, 18)>
<17, (1, 5, 0)>
<18, (15, 16, 13)>
<19, (8, 16, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
