Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 19) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 17) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 17) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 1) (18, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 10) 

Response:
As a 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on this definition. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:
1. Central node 11: (11, 6), (11, 8), (11, 4) -> <11, (6, 8, 4)>
2. Central node 16: No 3-star as there are no sets of 3 edges connected to node 16.
3. Central node 5: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 5.
4. Central node 9: (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 19) -> <9, (2, 10, 19)>
5. Central node 6: (6, 11), (6, 3), (6, 12) -> <6, (11, 3, 12)>
6. Central node 1: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 1.
7. Central node 8: (8, 11), (8, 10), (8, 12) -> <8, (11, 10, 12)>
8. Central node 13: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 13.
9. Central node 0: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 0.
10. Central node 7: (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 0) -> <7, (5, 3, 0)>
11. Central node 19: (19, 5), (19, 9), (19, 1) -> <19, (5, 9, 1)>
12. Central node 17: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 17.
13. Central node 2: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 2.
14. Central node 15: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 15.
15. Central node 10: (10, 9), (10, 3), (10, 8) -> <10, (9, 3, 8)>
16. Central node 12: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 12.
17. Central node 18: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 18.
18. Central node 4: No 3-star as there are only two edges connected to node 4.
19. Central node 14: (14, 7), (14, 2), (14, 15) -> <14, (7, 2, 15)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph [6].
Unique 3-stars found: <11, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (2, 10, 19)>, <6, (11, 3, 12)>, <8, (11, 10, 12)>, <7, (5, 3, 0)>, <19, (5, 9, 1)>.
