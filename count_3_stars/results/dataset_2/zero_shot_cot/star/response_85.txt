Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (19, 0) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars present.

1. <3, (6, 9, 14)>
2. <5, (1, 4, 2)>
3. <7, (10, 18, 15)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.]
