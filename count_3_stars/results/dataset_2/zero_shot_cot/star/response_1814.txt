Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 14) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be the centers of the 3-stars. Let's list the 3-stars in this graph:

<5, (13, 2, 1)>
<9, (4, 3, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (4, 13, 0)>
<1, (5, 4, 11)>
<3, (9, 2, 12)>
<10, (11, 8, 8)>
<11, (1, 10, 12)>
<8, (3, 10, 13)>
<13, (5, 7, 14)>
<2, (5, 3, 11)>
<0, (5, 7, 12)>
<6, (4, 8, 14)>
<14, (5, 13, 2)>
<12, (3, 11, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have 15 in total. So the answer is [15].
