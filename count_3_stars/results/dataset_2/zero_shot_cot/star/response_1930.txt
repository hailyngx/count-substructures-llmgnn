Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 15) (3, 25) (3, 24) (25, 9) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 22) (8, 23) (8, 20) (23, 8) (23, 29) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 20) (22, 25) (22, 4) (22, 16) (26, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 15) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 28) (10, 9) (10, 19) (4, 22) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 19) (2, 5) (2, 24) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 2) (24, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 27) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 6) (18, 21) (18, 27) (18, 29) (18, 13) (27, 7) (27, 18) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 15) (1, 12) (1, 24) (1, 0) (1, 13) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (29, 14) (29, 23) (29, 11) (29, 18) 

Response:
There are a total of [30] nodes and [90] edges in the given graph.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. I will list all the nodes adjacent to each node:
- Node 0: 5, 1, 6
- Node 1: 12, 24, 0, 13
- Node 2: 5, 24
- Node 3: 25, 24
- Node 4: 22, 6
- Node 5: 9, 2, 24, 0
- Node 6: 4, 0, 15
- Node 7: 15, 27
- Node 8: 23, 20
- Node 9: 5, 25, 15, 10
- Node 10: 9, 19
- Node 11: 13, 29, 15
- Node 12: 16, 1
- Node 13: 11, 18, 1
- Node 14: 17, 19, 29, 25
- Node 15: 9, 17, 11, 7, 6
- Node 16: 17, 22, 12, 19
- Node 17: 14, 20, 16, 15
- Node 18: 21, 27, 29, 13
- Node 19: 14, 10, 16
- Node 20: 17, 8, 28
- Node 21: 28, 18
- Node 22: 25, 4, 16
- Node 23: 8, 29
- Node 24: 5, 3, 2, 1
- Node 25: 9, 14, 3, 22
- Node 26: 28
- Node 27: 7, 18
- Node 28: 21, 26, 20
- Node 29: 14, 23, 11, 18

2. Now, I will identify the 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 0)>
<9, (5, 25, 15)>
<14, (17, 19, 29)>
<17, (14, 20, 16)>
<20, (8, 28, 17)>
<25, (9, 14, 3)>
<28, (21, 26, 20)>
<29, (23, 11, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
