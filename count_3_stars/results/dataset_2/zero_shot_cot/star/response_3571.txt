Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 3) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 11) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three edges connecting it to other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's identify the possible 3-star configurations:

Node 1:
- (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) [3-star: <1, (6, 11, 14)>]

Node 2:
- (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) [3-star: <2, (6, 5, 3)>]

Node 3:
- (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) [3-star: <3, (4, 2, 12)>]

Node 4:
- (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) [3-star: <4, (6, 9, 0)>]

Node 5:
- (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 10) [3-star: <5, (2, 7, 10)>]

Node 6:
- (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) [3-star: <6, (9, 1, 2)>]

Node 7:
- (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) [3-star: <7, (11, 3, 10)>]

Node 8:
- (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) [3-star: <8, (13, 14, 12)>]

Node 9:
- (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) [3-star: <9, (6, 4, 10)>]

Node 10:
- (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) [3-star: <10, (9, 1, 7)>]

Node 11:
- (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) [3-star: <11, (13, 1, 14)>]

Node 12:
- (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) [3-star: <12, (8, 1, 0)>]

Node 13:
- (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) [3-star: <13, (9, 8, 11)>]

Node 14:
- (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) [3-star: <14, (8, 13, 1)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
