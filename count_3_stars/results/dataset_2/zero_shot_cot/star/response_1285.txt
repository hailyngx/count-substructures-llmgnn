Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (12, 6) (12, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 10.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 9, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 10, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 11, and 13.

2. Count the number of 3-stars for each eligible central node:
- Node 1: (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 8), (1, 4, 10), (1, 7, 8), (1, 7, 10), (1, 8, 10) = 6 3-stars
- Node 2: (2, 6, 7), (2, 6, 9), (2, 6, 14), (2, 7, 9), (2, 7, 14), (2, 9, 14) = 6 3-stars
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it is connected to more than three nodes.
- Node 5: No 3-stars as it is connected to more than three nodes.
- Node 13: No 3-stars as it is connected to more than three nodes.

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: 6 (from Node 1) + 6 (from Node 2) = 12

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 10)>, <1, (4, 8, 10)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 14)>, <2, (9, 14)>.
