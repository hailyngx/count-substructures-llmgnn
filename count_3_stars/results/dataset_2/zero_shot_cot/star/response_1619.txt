Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in this graph can be derived using the fact that each 3-star graph consists of 4 nodes and 3 edges. The number of possible 3-star graphs can be calculated by finding the number of ways to choose the 4 nodes and then connecting them in the 3 possible configurations.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes with degree 3 (i.e., nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes).
2. For each of these nodes, count the number of 3-star graphs that can be formed with that node as the central node.
3. Sum up the counts for all the nodes identified in step 1.

Let's begin:

1. Nodes with degree 3: 9, 13, 21, 28, 29 (5 nodes)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-star graphs for each of these nodes as the central node:

For node 9: (9, 5, 8), (9, 5, 13), (9, 5, 12) [3 unique 3-stars]
For node 13: (13, 9, 8), (13, 9, 21), (13, 9, 29) [3 unique 3-stars]
For node 21: (21, 13, 15), (21, 13, 23), (21, 13, 26) [3 unique 3-stars]
For node 28: (28, 4, 6), (28, 4, 24), (28, 4, 18) [3 unique 3-stars]
For node 29: (29, 13, 1), (29, 13, 18), (29, 13, 26) [3 unique 3-stars]

Summing up the counts for all identified nodes: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [15].

Unique 3-stars: <9, (5, 8, 13)>, <13, (9, 8, 21)>, <21, (13, 15, 23)>, <28, (4, 6, 24)>, <29, (13, 1, 18)>.
