Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 0) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 12) (7, 16) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 24) (0, 25) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 8) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 9) (20, 24) (5, 7) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 23) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 15) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 29) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 9) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 23) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (13, 21) (13, 20) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 29) (23, 6) (23, 15) (23, 11) (23, 10) (9, 20) (9, 28) (9, 29) (29, 26) (29, 11) (29, 9) (4, 0) (4, 24) (12, 22) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (19, 2) (19, 16) (19, 27) (27, 22) (27, 19) (10, 8) (10, 23) (10, 1) (10, 24) (24, 21) (24, 20) (24, 4) (24, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Nodes with 3 connections: 
- Node 0: (3, 25), (0, 25), (0, 20), (0, 4), (0, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 16), (7, 20), (7, 6), (5, 7)
- Node 8: (18, 2), (2, 8), (8, 0), (8, 10), (8, 15)
- Node 11: (18, 11), (11, 18), (11, 1), (11, 29)
- Node 16: (14, 16), (18, 16), (16, 7), (16, 19)
- Node 20: (0, 20), (20, 7), (20, 13), (20, 9), (20, 24)
- Node 22: (3, 22), (18, 22), (22, 27), (22, 12)
- Node 23: (6, 23), (15, 23), (11, 23), (23, 10)
- Node 24: (21, 24), (0, 24), (24, 10), (24, 4)
- Node 25: (3, 25), (25, 0)


2. Potential 3-stars: 
- Node 0: (3, 25, 0), (0, 20, 7), (0, 8, 2)
- Node 7: (7, 16, 18)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 25), (8, 10, 1), (8, 2, 19)
- Node 11: (11, 18, 16), (11, 1, 5)
- Node 16: (16, 14, 17), (16, 18, 11)
- Node 20: (20, 0, 25), (20, 7, 5)
- Node 22: (22, 3, 25)
- Node 23: (23, 6, 7)
- Node 24: (24, 21, 13), (24, 0, 25)


<0, (3, 25, 0)>, <0, (0, 20, 7)>, <0, (0, 8, 2)>, <7, (7, 16, 18)>, <8, (8, 0, 25)>, <8, (8, 10, 1)>, <8, (8, 2, 19)>, <11, (11, 18, 16)>, <11, (11, 1, 5)>, <16, (16, 14, 17)>, <16, (16, 18, 11)>, <20, (20, 0, 25)>, <20, (20, 7, 5)>, <22, (22, 3, 25)>, <23, (23, 6, 7)>, <24, (24, 21, 13)>, <24, (24, 0, 25)>
