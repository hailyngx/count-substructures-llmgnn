Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 17) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 19) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 2) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 3) (16, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 1) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 2) (8, 16) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes with exactly three adjacent edges, as these nodes have the potential to be the center of a 3-star graph. 

Nodes with exactly three adjacent edges are: 4, 7, 5, 6, 0, 10, 15, 1, 11, 9, 18, 2, 3, 17, 12, 13, and 19.

Next, let's examine each of these nodes to see if they can form a 3-star:

- Node 4: 3-star found: <4, (7, 9, 17)>
- Node 7: 3-star found: <7, (4, 0, 19)>
- Node 5: No 3-star found.
- Node 6: No 3-star found.
- Node 0: No 3-star found.
- Node 10: No 3-star found.
- Node 15: No 3-star found.
- Node 1: No 3-star found.
- Node 11: No 3-star found.
- Node 9: 3-star found: <9, (4, 11, 18)>
- Node 18: No 3-star found.
- Node 2: No 3-star found.
- Node 3: No 3-star found.
- Node 17: No 3-star found.
- Node 12: No 3-star found.
- Node 13: No 3-star found.
- Node 19: No 3-star found.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The two unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<7, (4, 0, 19)>
