Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 19) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 0) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 9) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) (7, 2) (7, 14) (5, 10) (5, 15) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-star configurations. Since each 3-star has one central node and three leaves, we can start by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 11 (connected to 10, 19, 6, 4)
- Node 1 (connected to 17, 15, 8)
- Node 8 (connected to 1, 13, 9, 19)
- Node 13 (connected to 16, 8, 2, 14)
- Node 2 (connected to 13, 7, 0)
- Node 18 (connected to 4, 9, 15)
- Node 17 (connected to 1, 3, 6)
- Node 15 (connected to 1, 18, 19, 5)
- Node 9 (connected to 10, 8, 18, 0)
- Node 19 (connected to 11, 8, 15)
- Node 10 (connected to 11, 12, 9, 5)
- Node 6 (connected to 11, 17)
- Node 0 (connected to 3, 2, 9)
- Node 14 (connected to 13, 12, 7)
- Node 7 (connected to 2, 14)
- Node 5 (connected to 10, 15)

Now, we can construct the 3-star configurations based on the nodes mentioned above. Counting the unique 3-stars, we get:

[6] 
<1, (17, 15, 8)>
<13, (16, 2, 14)>
<2, (13, 7, 0)>
<18, (4, 15, 9)>
<10, (12, 5, 9)>
<15, (18, 19, 5)>
