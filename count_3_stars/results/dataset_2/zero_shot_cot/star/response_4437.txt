Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (19, 13) (19, 14) (9, 16) (9, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (18, 1) (18, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes:
- Node 11 has degree 5 (3-star)
- Node 16 has degree 3 (not a 3-star)
- Node 1 has degree 3 (not a 3-star)
- Node 3 has degree 1 (not a 3-star)
- Node 4 has degree 3 (not a 3-star)
- Node 8 has degree 2 (not a 3-star)
- Node 5 has degree 3 (not a 3-star)
- Node 6 has degree 4 (3-star)
- Node 13 has degree 4 (3-star)
- Node 0 has degree 3 (not a 3-star)
- Node 7 has degree 3 (not a 3-star)
- Node 19 has degree 2 (not a 3-star)
- Node 9 has degree 2 (not a 3-star)
- Node 12 has degree 2 (not a 3-star)
- Node 17 has degree 5 (3-star)
- Node 2 has degree 4 (3-star)
- Node 15 has degree 2 (not a 3-star)
- Node 18 has degree 2 (not a 3-star)
- Node 14 has degree 2 (not a 3-star)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 10, and 6
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 10, and 5
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 17, and 2
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 5, and 2
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 7
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 16, and 4
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 2
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<11, (16, 10, 6)>
<6, (11, 10, 5)>
<6, (11, 17, 2)>
<6, (13, 5, 2)>
<13, (1, 5, 7)>
<17, (11, 16, 4)>
<17, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
