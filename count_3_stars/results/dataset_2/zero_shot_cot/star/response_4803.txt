Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are two 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<8, (9, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
