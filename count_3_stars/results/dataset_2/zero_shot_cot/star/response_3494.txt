Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars, where each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 10, 12)>
<1, (4, 13, 16)>
<2, (8, 18, 19)>
<3, (6, 12, 18)>
<4, (1, 5, 16)>
<5, (4, 9, 18)>
<6, (3, 12, 18)>
<7, (11, 14, 9)>
<8, (2, 13, 16)>
<9, (0, 5, 12)>
<10, (0, 15, 11)>
<11, (7, 10, 14)>
<12, (0, 6, 9)>
<13, (1, 8, 19)>
<14, (7, 11, 17)>
<15, (10, 18, 0)>
<16, (1, 4, 17)>
<17, (14, 16, 12)>
<18, (2, 5, 15)>
<19, (2, 8, 13)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
[20]
