Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify unique sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 5)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (7, 5, 1)>
<8, (5, 0, 3)>
<1, (4, 2, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<0, (9, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
