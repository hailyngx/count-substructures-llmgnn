Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's list down the nodes that form 3-stars:
1. Node 1: (6, 1), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 7), (5, 1)
2. Node 4: (3, 4), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 5), (4, 2)
3. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 2)
4. Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 0)
5. Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 2)
6. Node 0: (6, 0), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 2)
7. Node 2: (4, 2), (7, 2), (5, 2), (2, 0)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
<1, (6, 1, 9)>
<1, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (1, 0, 7)>
<4, (3, 4, 7)>
<4, (4, 8, 5)>
<4, (4, 5, 2)>
<7, (7, 9, 1)>
<7, (7, 3, 4)>
<7, (7, 4, 2)>
<8, (8, 4, 5)>
<8, (8, 5, 0)>
<5, (5, 4, 8)>
<5, (5, 8, 2)>
<0, (6, 0, 1)>
<0, (0, 8, 2)>
<2, (4, 2, 7)>
<2, (5, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
