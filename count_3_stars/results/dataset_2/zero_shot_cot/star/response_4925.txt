Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 9) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (22, 26) (22, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (9, 16) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 20) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 25) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 18) (20, 9) (20, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (15, 26) (15, 10) (29, 16) (29, 6) (29, 3) (8, 21) (8, 6) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 13) (25, 28) (25, 23) (27, 7) (27, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 29) (6, 8) (6, 24) (6, 3) (24, 6) (24, 2) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 24) (1, 12) (1, 27) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 19) (18, 17) (18, 23) (18, 3) (23, 25) (23, 18) (23, 4) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 10) (4, 23) (3, 12) (3, 29) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to 9, 28, and 23.
- Node 5 is connected to 11, 17, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to 29, 8, and 24.
- Node 8 is connected to 21, 6, and 9.
- Node 14 is connected to 11, 7, and 0.
- Node 15 is connected to 26, 10, and 3.
- Node 16 is connected to 11, 29, and 9.
- Node 18 is connected to 17, 23, and 3.
- Node 19 is connected to 17, 2, and 13.
- Node 20 is connected to 9, 17, and 4.
- Node 21 is connected to 7, 8, and 1.
- Node 22 is connected to 26, 9, and (source does not loop back to this node).
- Node 24 is connected to 6, 2, and (source does not loop back to this node).
- Node 25 is connected to 28, 23, and (source does not loop back to this node).
- Node 27 is connected to 7, 1, and (source does not loop back to this node).

2. List out the unique 3-stars:
<4, (9, 28, 23)>
<5, (11, 17, 3)>
<6, (29, 8, 24)>
<8, (21, 6, 9)>
<14, (11, 7, 0)>
<15, (26, 10, 3)>
<16, (11, 29, 9)>
<18, (17, 23, 3)>
<19, (17, 2, 13)>
<20, (9, 17, 4)>
<21, (7, 8, 1)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
