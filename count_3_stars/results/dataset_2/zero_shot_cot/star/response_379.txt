Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 4) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 17) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 14) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 0) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 4) (5, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we first need to analyze the given graph and identify all unique 3-stars.

From the given edges, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0: 1, 12, 15, 4
Node 1: 0, 7, 15
Node 2: 12, 19
Node 3: 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 17
Node 5: 7
Node 6: 9, 10, 14, 17
Node 7: 1, 13, 16, 5
Node 8: 3, 12, 17
Node 9: 3, 6
Node 10: 6, 12, 15
Node 11: 13
Node 12: 0, 2, 8, 10, 18
Node 13: 7, 11, 17, 19
Node 14: 6, 15, 18
Node 15: 1, 10, 14, 0
Node 16: 7, 17
Node 17: 4, 6, 8, 13, 16
Node 18: 12, 14, 19
Node 19: 2, 13, 18

Based on this information, we can identify the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 15, 4)>
<1, (0, 15, 7)>
<2, (12, 19, 18)>
<3, (8, 9, 6)>
<4, (0, 17, 6)>
<5, (7)>
<6, (9, 10, 14)>
<7, (1, 13, 16)>
<8, (3, 12, 17)>
<9, (3, 6, 10)>
<10, (6, 12, 15)>
<11, (13)>
<12, (0, 8, 18)>
<13, (7, 17, 19)>
<14, (6, 15, 18)>
<15, (0, 1, 14)>
<16, (7, 17)>
<17, (4, 6, 8, 13)>
<18, (2, 12, 19)>
<19, (2, 13, 18)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have 19 in total. 
So, the final answer is [19].
