Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 12) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by checking each node for a potential center of a 3-star, then counting the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: There are no 3-stars centered at node 0.
2. Node 1: There are no 3-stars centered at node 1.
3. Node 2: There is 1 3-star centered at node 2 <2, (3, 5, 13)>.
4. Node 3: There is 1 3-star centered at node 3 <3, (2, 4, 14)>.
5. Node 4: There is 1 3-star centered at node 4 <4, (3, 5, 10)>.
6. Node 5: There is 1 3-star centered at node 5 <5, (2, 4, 8)>.
7. Node 6: There are no 3-stars centered at node 6.
8. Node 7: There are no 3-stars centered at node 7.
9. Node 8: There are no 3-stars centered at node 8.
10. Node 9: There are no 3-stars centered at node 9.
11. Node 10: There are no 3-stars centered at node 10.
12. Node 11: There are no 3-stars centered at node 11.
13. Node 12: There are no 3-stars centered at node 12.
14. Node 13: There are no 3-stars centered at node 13.
15. Node 14: There are no 3-stars centered at node 14.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are <2, (3, 5, 13)>, <3, (2, 4, 14)>, <4, (3, 5, 10)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>.
