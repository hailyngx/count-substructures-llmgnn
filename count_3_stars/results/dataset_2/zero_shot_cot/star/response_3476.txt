Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. First, let's identify all the nodes connected to node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 2, and 3.

2. Next, let's check if any of the nodes connected to node 0 form 3-stars. We find a 3-star with node 0 as the center:
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<0, (9, 2, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<0, (2, 8, 3)>

3. Then, let's move on to the other nodes and identify any 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 8, 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 3, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 2, 3, 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 3, 0.

4. Based on the connections, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (5, 9, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 2)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<0, (9, 2, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<0, (2, 8, 3)>

5. Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we have found 6 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
