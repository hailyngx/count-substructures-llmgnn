Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 10) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-star graphs.

The nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 4, 7, and 8. 

Next, let's find the 3-stars with these nodes as centers:

1. <4, (12, 10, 14)>
2. <7, (6, 5, 13)>
3. <8, (5, 0, 12)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [3].
