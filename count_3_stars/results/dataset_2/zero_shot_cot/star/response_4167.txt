Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 19) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 18) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 14) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to the rest by exactly 3 edges. These nodes will act as the center of the 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 17.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 15, and 18.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 16, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 12, 13, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 19, and 8.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 16, and 17.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 19.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 17.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 10.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 14.

Next, we look for all 3-stars within the graph. 

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 5, 17)>
<1, (6, 15, 18)>
<2, (9, 16, 0)>
<3, (12, 13, 18)>
<8, (13, 19, 8)>
<10, (5, 16, 17)>
<14, (3, 5, 19)>
<15, (1, 6, 17)>
<19, (4, 12, 14)>
