Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 29) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 22) (20, 1) (20, 27) (20, 28) (7, 1) (7, 19) (12, 25) (6, 17) (28, 20) (28, 10) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 4) (14, 21) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 15) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 11) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 18) (9, 19) (19, 7) (19, 9) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 16) (15, 5) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 2) (4, 14) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (16, 18) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 10) (10, 28) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 26) (11, 18) (11, 22) (11, 27) (11, 2) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 11) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 11) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 21) (2, 15) (2, 11) (2, 21) (23, 25) (21, 14) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 2) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 18, and 20. <1, (7, 18, 20)>
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 17, and 6. <3, (0, 17, 6)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 24. <8, (9, 13, 24)>
4. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 29. <13, (5, 8, 29)>
5. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 27. <14, (0, 4, 27)>
6. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 26. <15, (2, 5, 26)>
7. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 18, and 29. <16, (10, 18, 29)>
8. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 22, and 27. <11, (2, 22, 27)>
9. Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 14, and 25. <21, (2, 14, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
