Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 7) (1, 7) (21, 15) (21, 16) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 28) (13, 14) (20, 15) (20, 22) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 29) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 25) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 17) (28, 13) (28, 11) (28, 24) (29, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 0) (9, 29) (9, 14) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 26) (10, 7) (0, 29) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 21) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 14) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 22) (25, 18) (26, 8) (26, 29) (26, 10) (26, 2) (6, 17) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 23) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 3) (3, 0) (3, 23) (24, 28) (24, 16) (24, 17) (2, 13) (2, 26) (2, 19) (19, 2) (19, 7) (12, 14) (7, 27) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 19) (22, 8) (22, 20) (22, 11) (22, 17) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can do this by checking the degree of each node. 

The nodes with degree 3 are: 
- Node 0
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 16
- Node 22
- Node 26
- Node 28
- Node 29

Now, we will list the 3-stars with one of these nodes as the center. 

<0, (16, 0, 3)>
<7, (27, 1, 19)>
<8, (15, 13, 18)>
<16, (21, 0, 24)>
<22, (11, 17, 20)>
<26, (29, 2, 10)>
<28, (13, 24, 11)>
<29, (4, 9, 26)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
