Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (0, 13, 2)>
<4, (1, 11, 12)>
<5, (9, 7, 11)>
<6, (9, 1, 10)>
<7, (5, 8, 14)>
<8, (9, 7, 13)>
<9, (5, 6, 10)>
<10, (1, 9, 13)>
<11, (5, 12, 14)>
<12, (4, 2, 11)>
<13, (8, 10, 3)>
<14, (0, 7, 11)>

After listing down all the unique 3-stars, we count them and put the final answer inside brackets.
