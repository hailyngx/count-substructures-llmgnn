Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 18) (4, 9) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 6) (15, 19) (15, 13) (13, 15) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 17) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (5, 17) (5, 12) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 10, 11)>
<4, (9, 18, 4)>
<6, (2, 6, 8)>
<10, (3, 10, 18)>
<11, (3, 11, 18)>
<12, (8, 9, 12)>
<14, (7, 10, 14)>
<15, (13, 15, 19)>
<16, (0, 9, 16)>
<17, (0, 17, 19)>
<19, (14, 15, 19)>
