Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify central nodes with exactly three neighbors (leaves).
2. Count the number of 3-stars for each central node.

Let's start by identifying the central nodes:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 14, 5, 13, 7
- Node 3 has neighbors: 14, 13
- Node 4 has neighbors: 8, 12, 10, 14
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 11, 12
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 14
- Node 6 has neighbors: 5, 10, 2, 11, 0
- Node 0 has neighbors: 6, 11, 13, 2
- Node 14 has neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 12 has neighbors: 4, 8
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 6, 0, 9, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 5, 2, 11, 10, 9
- Node 11 has neighbors: 8, 6, 0, 7, 13
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 7, 13
- Node 10 has neighbors: 4, 6, 7
- Node 13 has neighbors: 1, 3, 0, 11, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:

- For central node 1: <1, (2, 5, 7)>
- For central node 5: <5, (1, 6, 14)>
- For central node 14: <14, (1, 4, 5)>
- For central node 6: <6, (5, 10, 2)>
- For central node 7: <7, (5, 10, 11)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
