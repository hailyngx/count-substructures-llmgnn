Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star configuration. 

Let's list all unique 3-star configurations:

<0, (2, 5, 10)>
<1, (6, 9, 11)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 12)>
<4, (12, 13, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 13)>
<7, (2, 3, 10)>
<8, (2, 5, 14)>
<9, (1, 3, 12)>
<10, (0, 7, 9)>
<11, (1, 7, 11)>
<12, (3, 4, 9)>
<13, (4, 6, 9)>
<14, (2, 5, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-star configurations. 

There are 14 unique 3-star configurations, so the final answer is [14].
