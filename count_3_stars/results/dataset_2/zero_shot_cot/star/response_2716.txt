Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph from the provided edges, we need to identify each 3-star pattern which consists of a center node and three leaf nodes.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<6, (3, 8, 0)>
<1, (3, 0, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<0, (6, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 3, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
