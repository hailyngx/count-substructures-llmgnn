Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 26) (2, 16) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 22) (18, 27) (18, 14) (22, 29) (22, 6) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 25) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (5, 24) (5, 21) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 26) (28, 29) (28, 9) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 7) (19, 8) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 0) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (20, 27) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 26) (26, 27) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 12) (1, 13) (1, 25) (25, 29) (25, 10) (25, 1) (25, 0) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 4) (24, 23) (24, 5) (24, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 0) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 5) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 26) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can ignore all other edges for now since they don't form 3-stars.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7
- Node 27: Connected to nodes 18, 20, and 26
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 16, 21, and 0
- Node 29: Connected to nodes 28, 25, and 22
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 27, 14, and 7
- Node 22: Connected to nodes 29, 6, and 21
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 11, 25, and 8
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 11, 13, and 23
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 8, 4, and 1
- Node 23: Connected to nodes 8, 24, and 19
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 24, 21, and 0
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 22, 17, and 26
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 29, 9 and 25
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 28, 14, and 20
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 8, 12, and 0
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 17, 14, and 20

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by finding all unique combinations of the center node and its three leaves.

There are <16, (2, 4, 7)>, <27, (18, 20, 26)>, <2, (16, 21, 0)>, <29, (28, 25, 22)>, <18, (27, 14, 7)>, <22, (29, 6, 21)>, <10, (11, 25, 8)>, <8, (11, 13, 23)>, <13, (8, 4, 1)>, <23, (8, 24, 19)>, <5, (24, 21, 0)>, <6, (22, 17, 26)>, <28, (29, 9, 25)>, <9, (28, 14, 20)>, <19, (8, 12, 0)>, <3, (17, 14, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
