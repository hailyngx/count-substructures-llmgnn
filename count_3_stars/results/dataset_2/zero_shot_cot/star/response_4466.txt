Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
The central node of a 3-star graph needs to be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (0, 5, 1)>
<7, (6, 2, 9)>
<1, (4, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 0, 5)>
<5, (4, 1, 3)>
<6, (7, 5, 2)>
<2, (7, 6, 9)>
<8, (7, 5, 6)>
<9, (7, 1, 2)>
<0, (4, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
