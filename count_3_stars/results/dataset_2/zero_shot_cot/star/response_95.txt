Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (3, 10) (3, 19) (2, 28) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 16) (15, 20) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 29) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 24) (0, 23) (0, 6) (14, 23) (14, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 7) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 21) (16, 18) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 10) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 26) (21, 11) (17, 15) (17, 25) (17, 6) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 28) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 26) (26, 21) (26, 10) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 27) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 21) (11, 22) (12, 21) (12, 5) (12, 28) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 22) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 24) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 27) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 13) (24, 4) (24, 22) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 12) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 16) (23, 25) (27, 6) (27, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 3

There are 6 instances of 3-stars in this graph. Here they are:
<2, (28, 11, 21)>
<4, (18, 13, 24)>
<5, (14, 12, 22)>
<9, (29, 7, 10)>
<16, (18, 8, 23)>
<29, (20, 9, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
