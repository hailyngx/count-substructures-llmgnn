Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 23) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 16) (27, 22) (27, 11) (27, 28) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 24) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 14) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 29) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 16) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 17) (6, 15) (6, 23) (6, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 20) (28, 9) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 20) (29, 22) (29, 28) (29, 3) (8, 15) (8, 5) (8, 6) (11, 27) (11, 17) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 0) (14, 26) (14, 18) (14, 22) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 24) (24, 21) (24, 23) (24, 20) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 29) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 19) (19, 25) (19, 17) (19, 10) (20, 4) (20, 28) (20, 24) (20, 10) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 10) (0, 25) (12, 21) (16, 15) (16, 2) (10, 19) (10, 20) (10, 1) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

<[1, (4, 7, 10)]>
<[2, (16, 18, 21)]>
<[5, (8, 15, 17)]>
<[6, (8, 15, 23)]>
<[9, (22, 26, 28)]>
<[14, (18, 22, 26)]>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
