Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 2.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 8.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 3, and 0.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, and 0.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
- There are <6, (9, 7, 2)> and <9, (6, 8, 7)> in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
