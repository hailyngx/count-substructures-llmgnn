Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

The 3-star structures are as follows:
<5, (8, 1, 3)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<7, (5, 4, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 2)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (9, 7, 3)>
<8, (9, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 3, 0)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we have found 9 unique 3-star structures. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
