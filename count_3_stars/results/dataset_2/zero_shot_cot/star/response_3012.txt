Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 10) (16, 5) (16, 0) (7, 17) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (12, 13) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (14, 5) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 6, 10)>
<2, (1, 17, 19)>
<3, (1, 18, 19)>
<6, (1, 8, 11)>
<8, (6, 14, 7)>
<10, (1, 0, 19)>
<11, (6, 13, 19)>
<13, (9, 17, 12)>
<15, (6, 17, 18)>
<16, (0, 5, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10].
