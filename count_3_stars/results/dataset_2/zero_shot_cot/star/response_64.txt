Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (15, 11) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 8) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 9) (1, 16) (5, 10) (5, 14) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 18) (17, 8) (17, 16) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 19) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (13, 19) (13, 3) (13, 18) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 13) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that have exactly three incident edges, which indicates they are the central nodes of potential 3-stars. Then, we check each of those nodes to see if they satisfy the criteria of being connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the steps we will follow:
1. Identify nodes with exactly three incident edges.
2. Check each identified node to confirm if it forms a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of 3-stars.

Let's start by finding the nodes with three incident edges:
Nodes with three incident edges are: 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18.

Next, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star.

Checking node 4:
- (4, 7), (4, 14), (4, 6) - forms a 3-star: <4, (7, 14, 6)>

Checking node 7:
- (7, 4), (7, 19), (4, 6) - forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 19, 6)>

Checking node 8:
- (8, 15), (8, 17), (8, 18) - does not form a 3-star.

Checking node 11:
- (11, 10), (11, 12), (11, 15) - forms a 3-star: <11, (10, 12, 15)>

Checking node 12:
- (12, 11), (12, 0), (12, 9) - forms a 3-star: <12, (11, 0, 9)>

Checking node 15:
- (15, 11), (15, 2), (15, 19) - forms a 3-star: <15, (11, 2, 19)>

Checking node 16:
- (16, 1), (16, 17), (16, 3) - does not form a 3-star.

Checking node 18:
- (18, 0), (18, 8), (18, 16) - forms a 3-star: <18, (0, 8, 16)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <4, (7, 14, 6)>, <7, (4, 19, 6)>, <11, (10, 12, 15)>, <12, (11, 0, 9)>
