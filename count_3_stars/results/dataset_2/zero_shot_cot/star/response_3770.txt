Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The central nodes with their connecting leaves are as follows:
<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 1, 3)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (6, 0)>

So, there are 9 3-stars in total.  
Thus, the final answer is [9].
