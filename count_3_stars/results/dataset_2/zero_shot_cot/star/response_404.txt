Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) 

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them (leaves of the star):
- Node 5 has 5 edges connected (3 possible 3-stars).
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 7 has 5 edges connected (3 possible 3-stars).
- Node 1 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 8 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 13 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 0 has 5 edges connected (3 possible 3-stars).
- Node 14 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 11 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 12 has 4 edges connected (1 possible 3-star).
- Node 2 has 5 edges connected (3 possible 3-stars).
- Node 10 has 3 edges connected (0 possible 3-stars).

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 6, 4)>
- <5, (9, 3, 10)>
- <5, (9, 4, 7)>
- <7, (4, 1, 6)>
- <0, (9, 8, 14)>
- <0, (9, 14, 12)>
- <0, (4, 8, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 6, 4)>, <5, (9, 3, 10)>, <5, (9, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 1, 6)>, <0, (9, 8, 14)>, <0, (9, 14, 12)>, <0, (4, 8, 14)>.
