Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 4 to form 3-stars. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we are looking for nodes that share an edge with node 4. The nodes connected to node 4 are 0, 1, 3, 5, and 9. 

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 4: <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 5)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (5, 0, 9)>
This gives us 4 unique 3-stars centered at node 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
