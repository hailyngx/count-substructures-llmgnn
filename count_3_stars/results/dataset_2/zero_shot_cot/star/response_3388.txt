Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 12) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 15) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 20) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 20) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 9) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 5) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (28, 17) (28, 29) (28, 27) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 13) (29, 0) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 13) (21, 16) (21, 24) (7, 0) (12, 3) (27, 17) (27, 28) (27, 14) (0, 11) (0, 29) (0, 7) (0, 9) (9, 23) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 24) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 13) (26, 23) (26, 14) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 5) (1, 25) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 6) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 29) (19, 13) (15, 25) (15, 23) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (13, 29) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 19) (5, 17) (5, 16) (24, 23) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 20) (20, 11) (20, 22) (20, 24)
