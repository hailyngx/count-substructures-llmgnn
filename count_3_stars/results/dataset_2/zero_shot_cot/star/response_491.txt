Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<7, (4, 5, 12)>
<13, (5, 0, 10)>
<10, (4, 13, 11)>
<11, (4, 7, 10)>
<12, (7, 5, 6)>
<0, (13, 9, 14)>
<5, (7, 13, 12)>
<9, (4, 8, 11)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (13, 10, 11)>
<3, (4, 13, 12)>
<6, (8, 10, 12)>

There are total [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
