Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's start by looking at each node and its neighbors to see if there are any 3-stars centered around that node.
- Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 3) -> No 3-star
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 2) -> No 3-star
- Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 1) -> No 3-star
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 0) -> <3, (9, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 2) -> No 3-star
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0) -> <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 0) -> No 3-star
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3) -> No 3-star
- Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3) -> <8, (5, 6, 4)>
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 3) -> No 3-star

Therefore, there are three 3-stars in the given graph: <3, (9, 4, 7)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, and <8, (5, 6, 4)>.
So, there are [3] 3-stars in total.
