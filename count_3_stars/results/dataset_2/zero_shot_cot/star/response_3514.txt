Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 19) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 8) (28, 6) (28, 29) (28, 27) (28, 20) (29, 28) (3, 11) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 21) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 15) (17, 18) (20, 1) (20, 28) (20, 17) (20, 21) (21, 11) (21, 20) (18, 26) (18, 11) (18, 17) (14, 26) (14, 27) (14, 16) (14, 5) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 25) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 5) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (12, 10) (12, 25) (12, 8) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 15) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 13) (8, 26) (8, 12) (24, 7) (24, 17) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 19) (25, 2) (25, 12) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 15) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (9, 26, 20)>
<2, (22, 13, 10)>
<3, (11, 18, 21)>
<4, (7, 22, 27)>
<5, (14, 22, 5)>
<6, (9, 28, 13)>
<7, (4, 24, 27)>
<8, (26, 12, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 16)>
<10, (2, 10, 19)>
<11, (3, 11, 18)>
<12, (25, 12, 8)>
<13, (2, 13, 19)>
<14, (5, 27, 14)>
<15, (17, 15, 5)>
<16, (9, 16, 14)>
<17, (20, 17, 24)>
<18, (11, 18, 17)>
<19, (1, 19, 10)>
<20, (17, 20, 21)>
<21, (11, 21, 20)>
<22, (4, 22, 2)>
<24, (7, 24, 17)>
<25, (2, 25, 12)>
<26, (8, 26, 14)>
<27, (7, 27, 14)>
<28, (6, 28, 27)>
<29, (28, 29, 27)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
