Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 1) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<2, (6, 13, 3)>
<3, (6, 8, 11)>
<4, (9, 10, 12)>
<6, (9, 14, 3)>
<8, (7, 10, 14)>
<9, (6, 4, 11)>
<10, (5, 7, 12)>
<11, (9, 8, 3)>
<12, (4, 10, 14)>
<13, (5, 2, 1)>
<14, (6, 8, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
[11]
