Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 15) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 18) (2, 14) (2, 12) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 18) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 19) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 19) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 9) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (10, 0) (10, 9) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<3, (11, 8, 16)>
<7, (14, 12, 0)>
<1, (17, 15, 5)>
<13, (12, 5, 1)>
<8, (4, 3, 18)>
<17, (14, 1, 19)>
<0, (7, 12, 18)>
<15, (16, 1, 19)>
<18, (8, 12, 0)>
