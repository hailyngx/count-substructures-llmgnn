Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-star graphs. Each central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The central nodes in the given graph are: 6, 9, 4, 8, 0, 14, 3, 1, 2, 13.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by examining each central node's connections:

1. Central node 6 has connections with nodes 9, 5, 14, 2, 13, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <6, (9, 5, 14)>
   - <6, (9, 5, 2)>
   - <6, (9, 5, 13)>
   - <6, (9, 14, 2)>
   - <6, (9, 14, 13)>
   - <6, (5, 14, 2)>
   - <6, (5, 14, 13)>
   - <6, (14, 2, 13)>
   (Total: 8)

2. Central node 9 has connections with nodes 6, 8, 11, 3, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <9, (6, 8, 11)>
   - <9, (6, 8, 3)>
   - <9, (6, 11, 3)>
   (Total: 3)

3. Central node 4 has connections with nodes 14, 1, 3, forming the following 3-star:
   - <4, (14, 1, 3)>
   (Total: 1)

4. Central node 8 has connections with nodes 9, 10, 5, 0, 12, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <8, (9, 10, 5)>
   - <8, (9, 10, 0)>
   - <8, (9, 5, 0)>
   - <8, (10, 5, 0)>
   - <8, (5, 0, 12)>
   (Total: 5)

5. Central node 0 has connections with nodes 11, 8, 12, forming the following 3-star:
   - <0, (11, 8, 12)>
   (Total: 1)

6. Central node 14 has connections with nodes 6, 10, 4, 5, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <14, (6, 10, 4)>
   - <14, (6, 10, 5)>
   - <14, (6, 4, 5)>
   (Total: 3)

7. Central node 3 has connections with nodes 9, 4, 7, 12, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <3, (9, 4, 7)>
   - <3, (9, 4, 12)>
   - <3, (4, 7, 12)>
   (Total: 3)

8. Central node 1 has connections with nodes 11, 4, 7, 12, 2, 13, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <1, (11, 4, 7)>
   - <1, (11, 4, 12)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 12)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 2)>
   - <1, (4, 7, 13)>
   - <1, (7, 12, 2)>
   - <1, (7, 12, 13)>
   (Total: 7)

9. Central node 2 has connections with nodes 6, 10, 1, 13, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <2, (6, 10, 1)>
   - <2, (6, 10, 13)>
   - <2, (6, 1, 13)>
   (Total: 3)

10. Central node 13 has connections with nodes 6, 11, 1, 2, forming the following 3-stars:
   - <13, (6, 11, 1)>
   - <13, (6, 11, 2)>
   - <13, (6, 1, 2)>
   (Total: 3)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (9, 5, 14)>, <6, (9, 5, 2)>, <6, (9, 5, 13)>, <6, (9, 14, 2)>, <6, (9, 14, 13)>, <6, (5, 14, 2)>, <6, (5, 14, 13)>, <6, (14, 2, 13)>, <9, (6, 8, 11)>, <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 11, 3)>, <4, (14, 1, 3)>, <8, (9, 10, 5)>, <8, (9, 10, 0)>, <8, (9, 5, 0)>, <8, (10, 5, 0)>, <8, (5, 0, 12)>, <0, (11, 8, 12)>, <14, (6, 10, 4)>, <14, (6, 10, 5)>, <14, (6, 4, 5)>, <3, (9, 4, 7)>, <3, (9, 4, 12)>, <3, (4, 7, 12)>, <1, (11, 4, 7)>, <1, (11, 4, 12)>, <1, (4, 7, 12)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <1, (4, 7, 13)>, <1, (7, 12, 2)>, <1, (7, 12, 13)>, <2, (6, 10, 1)>, <2, (6, 10, 13)>, <2, (6, 1, 13)>, <13, (6, 11, 1)>, <13, (6, 11, 2)>, <13, (6, 1, 2)>.
