Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 24) (26, 21) (5, 13) (5, 19) (3, 27) (3, 2) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 13) (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 10) (22, 20) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 19) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 7) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 2) (20, 28) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 10) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 12) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 18) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 12) (1, 11) (1, 29) (17, 0) (17, 27) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 4) (7, 22) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 24) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 25) (27, 2) (4, 16) (4, 19) (12, 28) (12, 13) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 25) (24, 14) (24, 29) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 9) (18, 21) (29, 1) (29, 24) (0, 15) (0, 17) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 27) (2, 10) (14, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three edges, as these nodes have the potential to be the center of a 3-star. Here is the list of such nodes:
- Node 15: Connected to 4 nodes (20, 23, 0, 13)
- Node 16: Connected to 4 nodes (11, 19, 4, 10)
- Node 20: Connected to 4 nodes (15, 22, 2, 28)
- Node 23: Connected to 4 nodes (15, 8, 13, 19)
- Node 24: Connected to 5 nodes (9, 6, 25, 14, 29)
- Node 6: Connected to 4 nodes (28, 24, 7, 10)
- Node 7: Connected to 4 nodes (22, 8, 6, 25)
- Node 27: Connected to 4 nodes (3, 17, 25, 2)
- Node 2: Connected to 5 nodes (3, 11, 20, 27, 10)

Now, let's count the 3-stars with the identified nodes as the center:
- For Node 15, there is one 3-star: <15, (20, 23, 0)>
- For Node 16, there are two 3-stars: <16, (11, 19, 4)> and <16, (11, 4, 10)>
- For Node 20, there is one 3-star: <20, (15, 22, 2)>
- For Node 23, there is one 3-star: <23, (15, 8, 13)>
- For Node 24, there are two 3-stars: <24, (9, 6, 25)> and <24, (6, 25, 14)>
- For Node 6, there is one 3-star: <6, (28, 24, 7)>
- For Node 7, there is one 3-star: <7, (22, 8, 25)>
- For Node 27, there is one 3-star: <27, (3, 17, 25)>
- For Node 2, there is one 3-star: <2, (3, 11, 27)>

Now, we sum up the counts of 3-stars: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
