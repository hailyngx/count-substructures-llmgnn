Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 1) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Based on the given edge list, let's list all nodes along with their neighboring nodes:
- Node 0: 10, 6, 9, 4
- Node 1: 8, 13, 2, 7, 14
- Node 2: 8, 10, 1
- Node 3: 6, 7, 14
- Node 4: 13, 11, 5, 0
- Node 5: 13, 6, 4
- Node 6: 5, 14, 3, 0, 12
- Node 7: 10, 3, 14, 1
- Node 8: 13, 2, 10, 1
- Node 9: 10, 11, 0, 12
- Node 10: 8, 11, 0, 7, 2, 9
- Node 11: 10, 9, 4
- Node 12: 6, 9
- Node 13: 8, 5, 4, 1, 14
- Node 14: 13, 6, 3, 7, 1

2. Now let's identify the 3-star patterns by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- <0, (10, 6, 9)>
- <1, (8, 13, 2)>
- <4, (13, 11, 5)>
- <7, (10, 3, 14)>

Counting the unique 3-star patterns above, we find a total of [4] 3-stars.
