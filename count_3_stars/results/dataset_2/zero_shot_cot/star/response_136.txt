Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 12) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 8) (0, 10) (0, 3) (27, 24) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 22) (10, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 1) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 6) (21, 8) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 7) (16, 1) (29, 9) (29, 7) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 13) (23, 26) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 18) (2, 17) (22, 25) (22, 28) (22, 19) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 4) (3, 0) (3, 17) (7, 28) (7, 29) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 24) (17, 3) (17, 8) (15, 26) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 8) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 24) (13, 27) (13, 25) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 14) (8, 26) (8, 10) (8, 21) (8, 17) (8, 18) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 10 has edges to nodes 0, 11, and 6.
- Node 13 has edges to nodes 27, 25, and 10.
- Node 23 has edges to nodes 26, 20, and 25.
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 26, 21, and 17.
- Node 4 has edges to nodes 5, 19, and 24.
- Node 17 has edges to nodes 6, 2, and 24.
- Node 14 has edges to nodes 9, 13, and 12.
- Node 12 has edges to nodes 9, 14, and  <(12, 14, 9)>.

From the analysis above, we have identified 8 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
