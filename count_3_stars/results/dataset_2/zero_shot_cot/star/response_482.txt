Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each central node and its connected leaves. 

Let's start by examining each node to see if it is a central node of a 3-star:

- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes: 9, 2, 7, 1.
- Node 1 is connected to 6 other nodes: 9, 6, 2, 8, 7, 0.
- Node 2 is connected to 5 other nodes: 8, 4, 1, 7, 0.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: 5, 6, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to 2 other nodes: 6, 2.
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes: 9, 8, 3.
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 3, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes: 9, 2, 0, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to 5 other nodes: 5, 9, 2, 3, 1.
- Node 9 is connected to 5 other nodes: 5, 8, 1, 7, 0.

After examining each node, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<1, (9, 6, 2)>
<2, (8, 4, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (9, 2, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
