Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 16) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 11) (15, 0) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (10, 3, 15)>
<1, (11, 6, 15)>
<2, (16, 17, 14)>
<3, (0, 6, 12)>
<4, (10, 17, 19)>
<5, (12, 17, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 10, 11)>
<8, (6, 10, 8)>
<9, (3, 9, 16)>
<10, (0, 4, 13)>
<11, (7, 1, 13)>
<12, (5, 6, 3)>
<13, (10, 11, 19)>
<14, (16, 17, 18)>
<15, (1, 0, 13)>
<16, (2, 9, 14)>
<17, (2, 5, 19)>
<18, (14, 19, 16)>
<19, (17, 13, 18)>

After identifying the unique 3-stars, we count them to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 20 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
