Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be counted by considering each node as the center of a potential 3-star and checking how many edges are connected to its neighbors. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars in the given graph: 
- Node 0: (0, 4, 5), (0, 3, 6), (0, 1, 5) [3 <0, (1, 5, 0)>, <0, (4, 0, 3)>, <0, (5, 0, 1)>]
- Node 1: (1, 3, 7), (1, 0, 9), (1, 7, 8) [3 <1, (3, 7, 1)>, <1, (0, 1, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 1)>]
- Node 2: (2, 3, 4), (2, 8, 9) [2 <2, (3, 4, 2)>, <2, (8, 9, 2)>]
- Node 3: (3, 1, 5), (3, 2, 6) [2 <3, (1, 5, 3)>, <3, (2, 6, 3)>]
- Node 4: (4, 0, 8), (4, 7, 8) [2 <4, (0, 8, 4)>, <4, (7, 8, 4)>]
- Node 5: (5, 0, 3) [1 <5, (0, 3, 5)>]
- Node 6: (6, 3, 9), (6, 0, 9) [2 <6, (3, 9, 6)>, <6, (0, 9, 6)>]
- Node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 4, 9) [2 <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 9, 7)>]
- Node 8: (8, 1, 9) [1 <8, (1, 9, 8)>]
- Node 9: (9, 1, 7) [1 <9, (1, 7, 9)>]

Therefore, there are a total of 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [15].
