Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 10) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all sets of nodes where the center is connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (9, 10, 11)>
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 13, 14)>
<10, (6, 11, 8)>
<11, (6, 10)>
<8, (10, 13, 14)>
<13, (3, 8, 4)>
<2, (13, 12, 14)>
<12, (9, 6, 1)>
<14, (3, 8, 2)>
<7, (9, 1)>
<4, (5, 9, 13)>
<0, (9, 1, 8)>
