Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 14) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

1. From node 4: (4, 2), (4, 9), (4, 11)
2. From node 7: (7, 10), (7, 14), (7, 13), (7, 1)
3. From node 6: (6, 14), (6, 12), (6, 0)
4. From node 13: (13, 7), (13, 6), (13, 8)
5. From node 1: (1, 7), (1, 5), (1, 0)
6. From node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 12)
7. From node 2: (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 5)
8. From node 11: (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 3)
9. From node 14: (14, 7), (14, 6), (14, 9)
10. From node 12: (12, 6), (12, 1), (12, 3)
11. From node 10: (10, 7), (10, 13), (10, 1)
12. From node 0: (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 5)

Now we count the unique 3-stars:
<4, (2, 9, 11)>
<7, (10, 14, 13)>
<6, (14, 12, 0)>
<13, (7, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 5, 0)>
<5, (1, 2, 12)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
