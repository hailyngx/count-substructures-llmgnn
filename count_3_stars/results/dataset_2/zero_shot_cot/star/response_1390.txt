Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-star configurations. 

After analyzing the given edges, the possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<5, (9, 4, 14)>
<9, (5, 2, 7)>
<1, (3, 11, 14)>
<3, (1, 0, 13)>
<8, (1, 4, 14)>
<13, (3, 10, 8)>
<4, (5, 1, 8)>
<11, (1, 2, 0)>
<0, (9, 3, 12)>
<10, (13, 6, -)>
<2, (9, 4, 11)>
<12, (9, 0, 2)>
<6, (4, 10, 14)>
<14, (5, 1, 8)>
<7, (9, 8, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
