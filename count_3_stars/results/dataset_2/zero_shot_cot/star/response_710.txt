Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 16) (4, 14) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 16) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 16) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 7) (19, 12) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 7) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 13) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 13) (15, 4) (15, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 12) (10, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 0) (1, 9) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (4, 15, 18)>
2. <2, (0, 8, 18)>
3. <3, (1, 9, 13)>
4. <5, (6, 11, 12)>
5. <6, (4, 5, 16)>
6. <7, (11, 13, 18)>
7. <8, (2, 4, 16)>
8. <9, (1, 3, 5)>
9. <10, (13, 16, 13)>
10. <11, (5, 7, 14)>
11. <12, (0, 5, 19)>
12. <13, (6, 7, 10)>
13. <14, (4, 11, 17)>
14. <15, (0, 4, 15)>
15. <16, (6, 13, 17)>
16. <17, (14, 16, 17)>
17. <18, (7, 11, 18)>
18. <19, (12, 12, 0)>

There are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
