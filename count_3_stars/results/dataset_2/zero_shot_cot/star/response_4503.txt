Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 14. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<9, (5, 2, 3)>
<1, (9, 6, 0)>
<3, (9, 7, 12)>
<8, (11, 7, 8)>
<13, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 10, 6)>
<6, (5, 1, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (9, 13, 4)>
<7, (3, 13, 0)>
<11, (8, 6, 14)>
<14, (6, 7, 12)>
<12, (3, 6, 14)>
<10, (4, 14, 10)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
