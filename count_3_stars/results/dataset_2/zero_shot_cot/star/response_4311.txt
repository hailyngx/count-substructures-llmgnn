Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Central node 4: (4, 7, 8)
- Central node 7: (7, 5, 6)
- Central node 1: (1, 3, 6)
- Central node 3: (3, 1, 8)
- Central node 8: (8, 9, 4)
- Central node 2: (2, 9, 1)

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

List of unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 8, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 1)>
<3, (1, 8, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 1, 2)>
