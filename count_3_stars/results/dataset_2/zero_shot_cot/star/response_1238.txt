Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with degree 3 because they can potentially form the center of a 3-star graph. From the given edges, nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9 have degree 3. 

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph. We will check each potential center (nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9) and see if they are connected to exactly three unique nodes.

For node 1:
- <1, (5, 9, 6)>
- <1, (5, 9, 0)>
Total: 2

For node 2:
- <2, (5, 4, 3)>
Total: 1

For node 3:
No 3-stars exist with node 3 as the center.

For node 4:
- <4, (9, 7, 3)>
- <4, (9, 7, 2)>
Total: 2

For node 9:
- <9, (4, 7, 1)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
Total: 2

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 9, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 0)>, <2, (5, 4, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 1)>, and <9, (4, 7, 8)>.
