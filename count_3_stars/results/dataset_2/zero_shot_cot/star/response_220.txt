Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<6, (4, 0, 9)>
<9, (6, 4, 11)>
<5, (6, 8, 14)>
<7, (11, 12, 13)>
<12, (7, 10, 13)>
<2, (8, 3, 12)>
<8, (5, 3, 7)>
<0, (6, 4, 10)>
<10, (9, 0, 12)>
<11, (9, 7, 13)>
<3, (8, 12, 14)>
<14, (9, 5, 10)>
<4, (6, 0, 9)>
<13, (7, 1, 12)>
<1, (8, 13, 14)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
