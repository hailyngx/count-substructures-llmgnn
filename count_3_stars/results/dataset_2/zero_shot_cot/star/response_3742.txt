Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 23) (0, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 11) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 28) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 11) (20, 29) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 28) (21, 25) (21, 19) (21, 26) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 1) (26, 21) (26, 14) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 19) (9, 15) (9, 29) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 10) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 28) (28, 13) (28, 2) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 22) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 4) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 17) (1, 25) (1, 18) (22, 14) (22, 28) (22, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 22) (4, 3) (4, 17) (11, 25) (11, 12) (23, 27) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<2, (15, 7, 28)>
<5, (16, 18, 14)>
<13, (8, 28, 7)>
<16, (15, 5, 28)>
<18, (5, 19, 1)>
<19, (21, 18, 14)>
<21, (25, 19, 26)>
<25, (1, 11, 21)>
<27, (15, 12, 23)>
<28, (13, 2, 16)>
<29, (15, 20, 9)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
