Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 1) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 8) (22, 19) (22, 11) (23, 9) (23, 27) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 16) (19, 27) (26, 14) (26, 19) (26, 13) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 0) (28, 5) (13, 17) (13, 26) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 10) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 5) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 15) (10, 24) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 5) (9, 23) (9, 4) (29, 7) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 18) (24, 11) (24, 10) (24, 7) (24, 2) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 24) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (5, 28) (5, 21) (5, 15) (5, 4) (8, 3) (8, 20) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (25, 12) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 25) (18, 20) (18, 6) (2, 24) (2, 4) (27, 23) (27, 19) 

Response:
At first, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes as leaves. Then, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 14
- Node 7
- Node 16
- Node 26
- Node 22
- Node 19
- Node 13
- Node 21
- Node 10

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
<14, (17, 26, 10)>
<17, (14, 20, 1)>
<1, (17, 3, 16)>
<3, (1, 21, 0)>
<22, (19, 11, -)>
<22, (19, 11, -)>
<19, (22, 26, 16)>
<19, (22, 26, 16)>
<26, (14, 19, 13)>
<26, (14, 19, 13)>
<11, (22, 24, 7)>
<11, (22, 24, 7)>
<13, (17, 26, 7)>
<13, (17, 26, 7)>
<21, (3, 6, 5)>
<21, (3, 6, 5)>
<10, (14, 20, 15)>
<10, (14, 20, 15)>

Therefore, there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
