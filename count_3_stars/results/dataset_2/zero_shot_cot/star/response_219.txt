Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's analyze the graph:

From the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (6, 1, 4)>
<0, (3, 2, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 2, 0)>
<7, (5, 1, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>

There are total 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
