Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 19) (11, 14) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (3, 4) (3, 18) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 17) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 15) (12, 17) (12, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (19, 10) (19, 17) (7, 13) (7, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 1) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<0, (1, 8, 18)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 14)>
<3, (4, 18, 3)>
<4, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 13, 16)>
<6, (2, 10, 12)>
<7, (9, 13, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (16, 18, 7)>
<10, (6, 19, 2)>
<11, (14, 4, 11)>
<12, (6, 17, 12)>
<13, (7, 5, 8)>
<14, (11, 2, 15)>
<15, (16, 14, 17)>
<16, (5, 9, 15)>
<17, (12, 15, 19)>
<18, (2, 3, 18)>
<19, (17, 10, 19)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [19].
