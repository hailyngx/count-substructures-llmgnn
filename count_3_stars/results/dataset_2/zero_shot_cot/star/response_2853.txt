Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 17) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (13, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 5) (17, 18) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 11, 18, 5, 14
- Node 1: 6, 13
- Node 2: 18, 8, 12, 16
- Node 3: 19
- Node 4: 6, 10, 5
- Node 5: 15, 6, 4, 0
- Node 6: 5, 1, 12, 4
- Node 7: 14, 12, 17
- Node 8: 15, 2, 14, 16
- Node 9: 11, 14
- Node 10: 11, 4
- Node 11: 9, 10, 0
- Node 12: 6, 2, 7, 19
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 9, 0, 8, 7
- Node 15: 16, 8, 5
- Node 16: 15, 2, 18, 8
- Node 17: 18, 7
- Node 18: 2, 16, 0, 17
- Node 19: 3, 12

Now, let's identify the 3-stars counted:
<0, (11, 18, 5)>
<0, (11, 18, 14)>
<0, (11, 5, 14)>
<2, (8, 16, 15)>
<6, (1, 12, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 12)>
<6, (12, 2, 7)>
<6, (12, 4, 5)>
<6, (12, 4, 2)>
<6, (12, 4, 7)>
<11, (10, 0, 4)>
<11, (10, 4, 5)>
<11, (10, 0, 18)>
<14, (8, 0, 15)>
<14, (8, 0, 5)>
<14, (8, 16, 15)>
<16, (18, 0, 15)>
<16, (18, 0, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
