Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 15) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 3) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 2) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:
1. <0, (9, 14, 18)>
2. <1, (6, 12, 13)>
3. <2, (3, 15, 16)>
4. <3, (0, 4, 11)>
5. <4, (3, 5, 19)>
6. <5, (4, 7, 12)>
7. <6, (1, 12, 13)>
8. <7, (5, 10, 17)>
9. <9, (0, 11, 15)>
10. <11, (3, 9, 17)>
11. <12, (5, 6, 16)>
12. <13, (1, 6, 16)>
13. <14, (0, 18, 19)>
14. <15, (2, 3, 15)>
15. <16, (2, 12, 17)>
16. <17, (7, 11, 16)>
17. <18, (0, 14, 18)>
18. <19, (4, 5, 14)>
