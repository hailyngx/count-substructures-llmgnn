Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 19) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 16) (0, 14) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 15) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 4) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 1) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<9, (8, 18, 7)>
<14, (17, 0, 3)>
<17, (14, 19, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (13, 16, 2)>
<18, (9, 15, 16)>
<0, (14, 17, 3)>
<3, (14, 0, 15)>
<11, (8, 12, 15)>
<8, (9, 11, 19)>
<13, (4, 15, 7)>
<19, (17, 8, 10)>
<16, (14, 18, 4)>
<1, (6, 19, 10)>
<2, (5, 11, 13)>
<12, (6, 11, 2)>
<7, (9, 6, 13)>
<10, (18, 19, 1)>
<15, (18, 11, 13)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
