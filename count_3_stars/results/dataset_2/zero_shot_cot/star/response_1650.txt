Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing out all the 3-stars in this graph:

<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>
<1, (6, 5, 7)>
<3, (9, 8, 4)>
<4, (9, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>
<5, (6, 8, 2)>
<2, (9, 8, 5)>
<0, (6, 4, 8)>
<7, (9, 1, 5)>

Since these are all the unique 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
