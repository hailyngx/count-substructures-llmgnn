Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 21) (26, 28) (26, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 14) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 20) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 5) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 15) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 4) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 18) (0, 17) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 1) (20, 0) (18, 2) (18, 3) (18, 4) (4, 23) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 8) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 16) (21, 9) (21, 4) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 15) (5, 10) (5, 24) (13, 11) (13, 27) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 28) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 25) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 8) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 12) (8, 27) (6, 14) (6, 11) (25, 22) (25, 16) (25, 19) (27, 22) (27, 13) (27, 8) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 12) (19, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern.

Let's label the nodes as follows based on the given edges:
Node 0: {0}
Node 1: {1}
Node 2: {2}
Node 3: {3}
Node 4: {4}
Node 5: {5}
Node 6: {6}
Node 7: {7}
Node 8: {8}
Node 9: {9}
Node 10: {10}
Node 11: {11}
Node 12: {12}
Node 13: {13}
Node 14: {14}
Node 15: {15}
Node 16: {16}
Node 17: {17}
Node 18: {18}
Node 19: {19}
Node 20: {20}
Node 21: {21}
Node 22: {22}
Node 23: {23}
Node 24: {24}
Node 25: {25}
Node 26: {26}
Node 27: {27}
Node 28: {28}
Node 29: {29}

By examining the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (17, 20, 7)>
<1, (20, 29, 24)>
<3, (1, 18, 4)>
<4, (23, 18, 8)>
<5, (24, 10, 15)>
<6, (14, 11, 6)>
<8, (4, 28, 27)>
<9, (22, 15, 21)>
<10, (11, 15, 5)>
<12, (17, 16, 24)>
<13, (11, 27, 13)>
<14, (2, 6, 14)>
<16, (7, 12, 25)>
<17, (0, 14, 17)>
<18, (2, 3, 4)>
<20, (14, 29, 1)>
<21, (9, 4, 22)>
<22, (9, 23, 25)>
<24, (1, 5, 12)>
<25, (16, 19, 22)>
<26, (7, 28, 22)>
<27, (8, 13, 27)>
<28, (26, 8, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24], as there are 24 unique 3-star patterns present in the graph.
