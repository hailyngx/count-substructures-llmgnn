Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 0) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 23) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 8) (27, 15) (27, 11) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 24) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 9) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (17, 1) (17, 8) (25, 7) (25, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 22) (20, 29) (20, 19) (20, 6) (20, 10) (18, 19) (18, 28) (19, 29) (19, 20) (19, 18) (19, 22) (6, 7) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 2) (24, 7) (24, 6) (22, 29) (22, 19) (22, 12) (22, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (23, 21) (23, 15) (23, 4) (12, 5) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 26) (10, 20) (10, 28) (14, 5) (14, 12) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 26) (11, 27) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 26) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 8) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 22) (8, 16) (28, 18) (28, 2) (28, 10) (26, 12) (26, 4) (26, 11) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Find all nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them:
   - Node 7 has edges with nodes 21, 25, and 6.
   - Node 3 has edges with nodes 21, 16, and 9.
   - Node 20 has edges with nodes 29, 19, and 6.
   - Node 19 has edges with nodes 29, 20, and 18.
   - Node 22 has edges with nodes 29, 19, and 12.
   - Node 2 has edges with nodes 13, 6, and 28.
   - Node 24 has edges with nodes 7, 6, and 25.
   - Node 4 has edges with nodes 23, 0, and 16.
   - Node 26 has edges with nodes 12, 4, and 11.

2. From the above step, identify the 3-stars: 
   - <7, (21, 25, 6)>
   - <3, (21, 16, 9)>
   - <20, (29, 19, 6)>
   - <19, (29, 20, 18)>
   - <22, (29, 19, 12)>
   - <2, (13, 6, 28)>
   - <24, (7, 6, 25)>
   - <4, (23, 0, 16)>
   - <26, (12, 4, 11)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars found: 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
