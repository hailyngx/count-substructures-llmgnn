Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 17) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 10) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (11, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (15, 19, 8)>
<4, (7, 13, 10)>
<7, (4, 12, 11)>
<8, (3, 13, 5)>
<12, (7, 16, 17)>
<16, (0, 12, 10)>
<19, (3, 18, 6)>
<0, (16, 1, 6)>
<9, (15, 7, 2)>
<1, (0, 9, 2)>
<14, (4, 1)>
<2, (9, 1)>
<11, (7)>
<17, (12)>
<5, (8)>
<13, (4)>
<18, (19)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [16].
