Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (11, 15) (11, 9) (0, 5) (0, 13) (7, 10) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 16) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 4) (19, 18) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (8, 5) (8, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) 

Response:
We will count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: [5, 13]
- Node 1: [3, 4, 13]
- Node 2: [9, 16]
- Node 3: [1, 14, 15, 16]
- Node 4: [1, 12, 15, 19]
- Node 5: [0, 6, 8, 10]
- Node 6: [5, 9, 12, 16]
- Node 7: [10]
- Node 8: [5, 10]
- Node 9: [2, 6, 11, 14]
- Node 10: [5, 7, 8, 15]
- Node 11: [9, 15]
- Node 12: [4, 6, 13, 14, 18]
- Node 13: [0, 1, 12]
- Node 14: [3, 9, 12]
- Node 15: [3, 4, 10, 11]
- Node 16: [2, 3, 6, 17]
- Node 17: [16]
- Node 18: [12, 19]
- Node 19: [4, 18]

Step 2: Check each node if it forms a 3-star:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 14, 15)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (1, 12, 19)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 8, 10)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 11, 14)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (7, 8, 15)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (4, 13, 18)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (2, 6, 17)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
- Total unique 3-stars: 6
