Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (6, 15) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (10, 7) (0, 17) (0, 5) (9, 19) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of unique potential 3-stars in the graph. Since we are given that each 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all possible combinations of 3 nodes adjacent to each center node.

Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (15, 19, 12)>
<4, (11, 16, 3)>
<7, (4, 18, 2)>
<15, (3, 19, 6)>
<16, (13, 4, n/a)>
<17, (15, 2, 0)>
<18, (7, 2, 8)>
<19, (3, 15, 9)>
<1, (13, 14, n/a)>
<5, (11, 0, n/a)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars: 10
Therefore, the answer is [10].
