Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (6, 7, 12)>
<7, (4, 2, 5)>
<12, (9, 4, 14)>
<0, (4, 5, 14)>
<2, (7, 3, 11)>
<5, (7, 13, 0)>
<1, (6, 13, 12)>
<11, (9, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 13, 2)>
<10, (6, 9, 14)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
