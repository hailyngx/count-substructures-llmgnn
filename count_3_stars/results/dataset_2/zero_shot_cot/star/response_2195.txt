Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 21) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 29) (23, 19) (1, 16) (26, 16) (26, 7) (26, 17) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 7) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 5) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 10) (28, 6) (28, 20) (28, 25) (3, 7) (3, 22) (21, 8) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 11) (19, 8) (19, 23) (19, 4) (19, 0) (2, 24) (2, 14) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 12) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 22) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 27) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 14) (0, 19) (0, 29) (16, 1) (16, 26) (7, 26) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 27) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 11) (13, 10) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 12) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 10) (27, 17) (27, 7) (27, 24) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 25) (10, 20) (10, 13) (10, 24) (10, 12) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 24) (12, 10) (18, 15) (18, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <5, (6, 20, 29)>
2. <6, (5, 7, 28)>
3. <7, (6, 26, 27)>
4. <8, (9, 19, 23)>
5. <9, (4, 8, 25)>
6. <10, (12, 13, 24)>
7. <11, (9, 13, 27)>
8. <12, (10, 24, 29)>
9. <13, (10, 11, 10)>
10. <14, (2, 23, 25)>
11. <15, (17, 18, 20)>
12. <16, (1, 26, 0)>
13. <17, (15, 26, 27)>
14. <18, (15, 20, 18)>
15. <19, (4, 8, 23)>
16. <20, (5, 15, 18)>
17. <23, (8, 14, 29)>
18. <24, (2, 10, 12)>
19. <25, (14, 9, 28)>
20. <26, (16, 17, 7)>
21. <27, (7, 17, 24)>
22. <28, (5, 6, 20)>
23. <29, (0, 12, 23)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find there are [23].
