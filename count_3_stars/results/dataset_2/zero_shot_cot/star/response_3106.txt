Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 4) (16, 14) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 4) (9, 10) (18, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 16) (3, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars present in the graph:

<14, (17, 8, 1)>
<17, (14, 12, 19)>
<10, (0, 9, 16)>
<11, (19, 13, 5)>
<5, (11, 6, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 12)>
<0, (10, 5, 16)>
<1, (14, 6, 15)>
<15, (1, 12, 4)>
<8, (14, 19, 3)>
<19, (11, 8, 4)>
<16, (14, 0, 3)>
<9, (10, ... - not connected to 3 nodes>
<18, (... - not connected to 3 nodes)>
<7, (... - not connected to 3 nodes)>
<4, ... - not connected to 3 nodes)>
<12, ... - not connected to 3 nodes)>
<13, ... - not connected to 3 nodes)>
<3, ... - not connected to 3 nodes)>

Since each 3-star is unique, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
