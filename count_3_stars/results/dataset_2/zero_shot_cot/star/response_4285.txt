Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 8) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 14), (1, 5), (1, 9) => 5 potential 3-stars
2. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 0) => 2 potential 3-stars
3. Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 3), (4, 11) => 4 potential 3-stars
4. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 10), (5, 14) => 5 potential 3-stars
5. Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 9), (6, 10), (6, 0) => 4 potential 3-stars
6. Node 8: (8, 7), (8, 13), (8, 2), (8, 11), (8, 0) => 5 potential 3-stars
7. Node 13: (13, 4), (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 10), (13, 9) => 6 potential 3-stars

Adding up the individual counts, we get a total of 5 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 31 potential 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<1, (7, 2, 5)>
<3, (4, 0, 13)>
<4, (7, 11, 3)>
<6, (7, 0, 9)>
<8, (7, 13, 11)>
<13, (4, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 14, 10)>

So, there are [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
