Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 7) (10, 13) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (20, 4) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 5) (26, 22) (26, 21) (26, 7) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 12) (7, 13) (7, 22) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 26) (3, 28) (3, 23) (8, 19) (9, 17) (9, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 15) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 14) (5, 28) (5, 1) (5, 14) (29, 25) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 4) (29, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 29) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 24) (15, 25) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (23, 3) (23, 9) (23, 27) (23, 15) (2, 24) (4, 20) (4, 19) (4, 29) (4, 24) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 18) (11, 21) (11, 15) (24, 14) (24, 2) (24, 4) (18, 29) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list down all nodes and their degree:

Node 0 - degree 4  
Node 1 - degree 3  
Node 2 - degree 2  
Node 3 - degree 2  
Node 4 - degree 5  
Node 5 - degree 4  
Node 6 - degree 4  
Node 7 - degree 5  
Node 8 - degree 2  
Node 9 - degree 3  
Node 10 - degree 5  
Node 11 - degree 3  
Node 12 - degree 4  
Node 13 - degree 4  
Node 14 - degree 4  
Node 15 - degree 3  
Node 16 - degree 3  
Node 17 - degree 3  
Node 18 - degree 2  
Node 19 - degree 4  
Node 20 - degree 1  
Node 21 - degree 3  
Node 22 - degree 4  
Node 23 - degree 4  
Node 24 - degree 4  
Node 25 - degree 3  
Node 26 - degree 4  
Node 27 - degree 3  
Node 28 - degree 3  
Node 29 - degree 5  

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

<0, (13, 10, 7)>  
<1, (0, 5, 18)>  
<2, (24, 4, 29)>  
<3, (28, 23, 9)>  
<4, (20, 19, 24)>  
<5, (15, 1, 14)>  
<6, (10, 0, 29)>  
<7, (13, 22, 26)>  
<8, (19, 8, 4)>  
<9, (17, 12, 23)>  
<11, (21, 16, 15)>  
<13, (22, 10, 0)>  
<14, (28, 16, 5)>  
<17, (10, 12, 9)>  
<18, (29, 1, 18)>  
<20, (4, 19, 20)>  
<21, (26, 21, 11)>  
<22, (13, 26, 7)>  
<23, (3, 9, 27)>  
<24, (14, 2, 4)>  
<25, (27, 15, 29)>  
<26, (22, 21, 7)>  
<28, (3, 14, 5)>  

Therefore, there are 23 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the answer is [23].
