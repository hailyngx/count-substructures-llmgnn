Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 1) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) 

Response:
The central nodes with three connected nodes form 3-stars. Let's list them:

<0, (14, 11, 8)>
<14, (6, 8, 1)>
<4, (10, 11, 6)>
<12, (5, 10, 3)>
<1, (12, 6, 10)>
<6, (4, 1, 7)>
<3, (12, 9, 5)>
<5, (14, 12, 2)>
<8, (0, 14, 5)>
<10, (4, 12, 1)>
<9, (0, 7, 11)>
<13, (10, 9, 4)>

There are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
