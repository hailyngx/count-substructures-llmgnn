Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by examining each node. A 3-star is formed when a node has exactly three neighbors. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: Degree is 2
- Node 1: Degree is 4
- Node 2: Degree is 4
- Node 3: Degree is 4
- Node 4: Degree is 3
- Node 5: Degree is 3
- Node 6: Degree is 3
- Node 7: Degree is 5
- Node 8: Degree is 5
- Node 9: Degree is 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 3, 8)>
