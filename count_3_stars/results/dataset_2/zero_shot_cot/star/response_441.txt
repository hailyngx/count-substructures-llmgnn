Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:
1. Central: 5, Leaves: 1, 3, 4
2. Central: 9, Leaves: 1, 2, 7
3. Central: 4, Leaves: 0, 2, 7
4. Central: 7, Leaves: 0, 4, 6
5. Central: 2, Leaves: 1, 3, 4
6. Central: 8, Leaves: 2, 3, 5
7. Central: 0, Leaves: 3, 4, 6
8. Central: 1, Leaves: 2, 5, 9
9. Central: 6, Leaves: 0, 1, 7

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>.
