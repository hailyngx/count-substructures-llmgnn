Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <4, (7, 12, 5)>
2. <7, (4, 12, 11)>
3. <12, (4, 7, 14)>
4. <5, (4, 7, 1)>
5. <13, (1, 10, 6)>
6. <3, (4, 5, 0)>
7. <1, (8, 5, 13)>
8. <6, (13, 1, 10)>
9. <0, (12, 5, 3)>
10. <2, (7, 3, 9)>
11. <14, (8, 12, 2)>
12. <9, (13, 2, 14)>
13. <11, (7, 0, 0)>

Since there are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final count is [13].
