Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 11) (5, 7) (5, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 8) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 8) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 16) (10, 7) (10, 14) (8, 15) (8, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 12, and 19: <2, (18, 12, 19)>
2. Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 11: <18, (2, 4, 11)>
3. Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 0: <12, (2, 7, 0)>
4. Node 0 is connected to nodes 12, 14, and 17: <0, (12, 14, 17)>
5. Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 19: <14, (0, 6, 19)>
6. Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 13, and 11: <4, (18, 13, 11)>
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 10, and 9: <7, (12, 10, 9)>
8. Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 17, and 3: <13, (4, 17, 3)>
9. Node 3 is connected to nodes 18, 13, and 17: <3, (18, 13, 17)>
10. Node 11 is connected to nodes 18, 4, and 3: <11, (18, 4, 3)>
11. Node 17 is connected to nodes 0, 13, and 3: <17, (0, 13, 3)>
12. Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 13, and 8: <6, (14, 13, 8)>
13. Node 19 is connected to nodes 2, 14, and 9: <19, (2, 14, 9)>
14. Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 15, and 19: <9, (7, 15, 19)>
15. Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 14, and 0: <10, (7, 14, 0)>
16. Node 8 is connected to nodes 15, 6, and an extra connection: <8, (15, 6, extra)>. Since there is an extra connection, this is not a valid 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [15]
