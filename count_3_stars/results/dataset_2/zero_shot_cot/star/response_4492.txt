Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 12) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 2) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 4) (19, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 4) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are each connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (13, 1, 11)>
<1, (7, 0, 6)>
<2, (18, 10, 17)>
<3, (14, 5, 4)>
<4, (6, 16, 17)>
<5, (11, 16, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 16)>
<7, (13, 12, 1)>
<8, (13, 11, 0)>
<9, (13, 14, 19)>
<10, (2, 18, 15)>
<12, (13, 7, 17)>
<15, (10, 11, 16)>
<14, (1, 3, 9)>
<16, (10, 5, 4)>
<17, (2, 9, 4)>
<18, (2, 12, 17)>
<19, (9, 13, 14)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [18] total 3-stars in the given graph.
