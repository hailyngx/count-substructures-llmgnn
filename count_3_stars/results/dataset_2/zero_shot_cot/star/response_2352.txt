Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 13) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 23) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 7) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 18) (20, 3) (20, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (19, 26) (19, 15) (26, 19) (26, 16) (26, 4) (28, 12) (28, 24) (21, 3) (21, 11) (21, 15) (21, 4) (7, 25) (7, 5) (7, 24) (7, 2) (7, 17) (11, 21) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 22) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (2, 7) (2, 22) (22, 3) (22, 0) (22, 11) (22, 2) (1, 27) (1, 18) (16, 26) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 23) (14, 29) (15, 19) (15, 21) (15, 17) (17, 6) (17, 7) (17, 15) (17, 4) (27, 1) (27, 29) (27, 10) (29, 8) (29, 14) (29, 27) (29, 12) (4, 9) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 17) (13, 9) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 12) (24, 28) (24, 7) (10, 23) (10, 27) (12, 6) (12, 28) (12, 8) (12, 29) (12, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Identify all the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 3 has neighbors 25, 21, 20, and 23.
- Node 5 has neighbors 6, 7, and 14.
- Node 7 has neighbors 25, 5, 24, and 2.
- Node 11 has neighbors 21, 23, 14, and 22.
- Node 17 has neighbors 6, 7, 15, and 4.
- Node 26 has neighbors 19, 16, and 4.
- Node 29 has neighbors 8, 14, 27, and 12.

2. Identify the 3-stars based on the central nodes and their neighbors:
- <3, (25, 21, 20)>
- <3, (25, 21, 23)>
- <3, (25, 20, 0)> (The edge (25, 7) is a duplicate and not counted)
- <3, (21, 15, 11)>
- <3, (25, 7, 2)>
- <5, (6, 7, 14)>
- <7, (5, 6, 14)>
- <21, (3, 11, 15)>
- <23, (3, 11, 14)>
- <29, (14, 27, 12)> (The edge (29, 8) is a duplicate and not counted)

Count of 3-stars: [10]
Unique 3-stars: <<3, (25, 21, 20)>, <3, (25, 21, 23)>, <3, (25, 20, 0)>, <3, (21, 15, 11)>, <3, (25, 7, 2)>, <5, (6, 7, 14)>, <7, (5, 6, 14)>, <21, (3, 11, 15)>, <23, (3, 11, 14)>, <29, (14, 27, 12)>]
