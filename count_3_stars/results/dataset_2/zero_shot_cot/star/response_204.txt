Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is part of a 3-star structure. 

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 13, 1)>
<9, (5, 10, 0)>
<13, (5, 8, 12)>
<4, (13, 6, 3)>
<7, (5, 12, 11)>
<12, (9, 13, 7)>
<0, (9, 8, 6)>
<14, (13, 7, 10)>
<3, (5, 4, 11)>
<11, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (12, 0, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have 11 in total. 
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
