Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we will search for such configurations in the graph.

Let's first list out the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 14, 5)>
<3, (0, 12, 9)>
<8, (2, 14, 9)>
<13, (10, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 5, 6)>
<7, (8, 13, 12)>
<12, (1, 14, 7)>
<0, (3, 10, 6)>
<14, (1, 8, 12)>
<2, (1, 8, 6)>
<11, (9, 5, 0)>
<9, (3, 4, 2)>
<10, (1, 13, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 11)>
<6, (4, 0, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The final answer is: [15]
