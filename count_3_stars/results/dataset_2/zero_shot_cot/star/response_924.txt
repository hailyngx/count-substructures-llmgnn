Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 19) (7, 8) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 18) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting how many nodes have exactly three edges attached to them. Let's go through the nodes and find all the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 0 (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 11) <0, (6, 9, 11)>
- Node 3 (3, 5), (3, 16), (3, 18) <3, (5, 16, 18)>
- Node 4 (4, 5), (4, 14), (4, 17) <4, (5, 14, 17)>
- Node 7 (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 17) <7, (6, 8, 17)>
- Node 10 (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 16) <10, (12, 13, 16)>
- Node 15 (15, 17), (15, 18), (15, 0) <15, (17, 18, 0)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [5].
