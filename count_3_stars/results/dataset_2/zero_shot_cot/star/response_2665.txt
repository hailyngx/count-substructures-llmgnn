Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 2) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (18, 8) (18, 7) (12, 15) (12, 6) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 11) (7, 18) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each unique 3-star and then count them.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 13)>
<2, (8, 15, 17)>
<3, (6, 14, 15)>
<4, (5, 8, 18)>
<5, (0, 1, 16)>
<6, (3, 12, 17)>
<8, (2, 5, 18)>
<9, (10, 11, 13)>
<10, (9, 16, 17)>
<11, (9, 10, 17)>
<12, (3, 6, 15)>
<13, (0, 1, 9)>
<14, (0, 3, 13)>
<15, (2, 12, 14)>
<16, (0, 5, 10)>
<17, (2, 6, 10)>
<18, (5, 7, 8)>
<19, (11, 17, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found 18 in total. 
So, the final answer is [18].
