Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 8) (15, 20) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 29) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 4) (20, 19) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 2) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 2) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 7) (26, 20) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 17) (6, 22) (21, 10) (21, 23) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 12) (10, 21) (10, 19) (25, 0) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (24, 1) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 11) (2, 28) (2, 9) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 29) (19, 20) (19, 10) (19, 25) (19, 7) (17, 26) (17, 23) (17, 4) (22, 3) (22, 28) (22, 6) (22, 12) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 17) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 22) (4, 20) (4, 17) (8, 27) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: (0, 27), (0, 11), (0, 25), (0, 23)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 12), (3, 22)
- Node 20: (20, 15), (20, 26), (20, 4), (20, 19)
- Node 26: (26, 20), (26, 13), (26, 18), (26, 25)
- Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 15), (5, 18), (5, 29)
- Node 19: (19, 20), (19, 10), (19, 25), (19, 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (27, 11, 25)> 
<27, (0, 25, 29)> 
<3, (1, 5, 12)> 
<20, (15, 26, 4)> 
<26, (20, 13, 18)> 
<5, (3, 15, 18)> 
<19, (20, 10, 25)>
