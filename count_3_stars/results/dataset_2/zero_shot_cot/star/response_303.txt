Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the 3-star structures:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
