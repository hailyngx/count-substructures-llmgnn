Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the unique nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

Upon analyzing the given information, the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are: 
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 14, 11, 6)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 10, 5)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 11, 13, x)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 11, 13, 9)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 0, 2, 5)

Let's count the unique 3-stars:
<4, (14, 11, 6)>
<7, (0, 10, 5)>

The final answer is [2].
