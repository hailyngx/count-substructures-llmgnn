Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 21) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 21) (0, 11) (0, 23) (20, 29) (20, 24) (20, 28) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 11) (5, 26) (5, 18) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 23) (28, 20) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 22) (28, 27) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (16, 9) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 23) (16, 27) (29, 20) (29, 1) (29, 10) (8, 3) (8, 10) (22, 28) (22, 12) (12, 22) (12, 17) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 27) (1, 7) (1, 29) (1, 24) (17, 6) (17, 12) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 18) (14, 4) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 19) (21, 27) (27, 28) (27, 16) (27, 19) (27, 21) (13, 7) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 29) (10, 8) (10, 13) (4, 14) (4, 24) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 18) (24, 20) (24, 19) (24, 1) (24, 4) (23, 0) (23, 6) (23, 16) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 14, and 8.  
2. Node 5 is connected to nodes 26, 18, and 6.  
3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 25, 10, and 1.  
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 26, 16, and 8.  
5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 29, and 8.  
6. Node 11 is connected to nodes 15, 18, and 0.  
7. Node 12 is connected to nodes 22, 17, and 0.  
8. Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 0.  
9. Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 4.  
10. Node 16 is connected to nodes 9, 15, and 28.  
11. Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 5, and 14.  
12. Node 20 is connected to nodes 29, 24, and 28.  
13. Node 21 is connected to nodes 26, 25, and 19.  
14. Node 24 is connected to nodes 20, 19, and 4.  
15. Node 26 is connected to nodes 9, 21, and 5.  
16. Node 28 is connected to nodes 20, 6, and 16.  
17. Node 29 is connected to nodes 20, 1, and 10.

Therefore, there are a total of [17] unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<3, (25, 14, 8)>, <5, (26, 18, 6)>, <7, (25, 10, 1)>, <9, (26, 16, 8)>, <10, (7, 29, 8)>, <11, (15, 18, 0)>, <12, (22, 17, 0)>, <13, (7, 10, 0)>, <14, (3, 15, 4)>, <16, (9, 15, 28)>, <18, (11, 5, 14)>, <20, (29, 24, 28)>, <21, (26, 25, 19)>, <24, (20, 19, 4)>, <26, (9, 21, 5)>, <28, (20, 6, 16)>, <29, (20, 1, 10)>.
