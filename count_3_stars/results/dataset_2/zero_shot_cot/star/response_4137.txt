Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 8) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them as these nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star. 
The nodes with degree 3 are: 4, 7, 13, 1, 3, 10, 11, 5, 2, 12, and 14.

Next, for each of these nodes, we will check if they are indeed the center of a 3-star by examining their neighbors to see if they form a 3-star pattern. 

For node 4:
- (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 5) form a 3-star <4, (7, 10, 5)>

For node 7:
- (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 8) form a 3-star <7, (4, 5, 8)>

For node 13:
- (13, 9), (13, 8), (13, 3) form a 3-star <13, (9, 8, 3)>

For node 1:
- (1, 8), (1, 3), (1, 14) do not form a 3-star.

For node 3:
- (3, 13), (3, 1), (3, 14) do not form a 3-star.

For node 10:
- (10, 4), (10, 9), (10, 1) form a 3-star <10, (4, 9, 1)>

For node 11:
- (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 10) form a 3-star <11, (4, 8, 10)>

For node 5:
- (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 6) form a 3-star <5, (4, 7, 6)>
- (5, 14) can be part of another 3-star, but we already counted this pattern.

For node 2:
- (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 12) form a 3-star <2, (4, 5, 12)>

For node 12:
- (12, 6), (12, 9), (12, 2) form a 3-star <12, (6, 9, 2)>

For node 14:
- (14, 1), (14, 3), (14, 5) form a 3-star <14, (1, 3, 5)>
- (14, 12) can be part of another 3-star, but we already counted this pattern.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <4, (7, 10, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <13, (9, 8, 3)>, <10, (4, 9, 1)>, <11, (4, 8, 10)>, <2, (4, 5, 12)>, <12, (6, 9, 2)>, <14, (1, 3, 5)>.
