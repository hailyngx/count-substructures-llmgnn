Response:
Let's label the nodes first for ease of reference. The graph has the following edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 22 and 17.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 15 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 18 and 23.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 26, 17, 11, and 27.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 16, and 24.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 22, 25, 10, and 23.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 24, 23, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 20 and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 18, 10, and 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 26 and 24.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 22, 4, 8, and 5.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 8 and 3.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 17 and 6.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 21 and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 28, 20, and 13.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 21, and 19.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 26, 4, and 24.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 29, 3, 0, and 12.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 22, 2, and 8.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and 19.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 7 and 14.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 13, 23, and 15.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 18, 27, 5, 10, and 0.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 21, 2, 6, and 5.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 9, 28, 16, 6, and 27.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 29 and 5.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 9, 29, 16, and 3.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 22, 29, 3, and 24.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 24 and 14.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 26, 17, 27, and 25.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars present in the graph:

- <11, (3, 8, 17)>
- <12, (6, 17, 27)>
- <13, (14, 21, 28)>
- <15, (1, 19, 21)>
- <16, (4, 24, 26)>
- <20, (7, 14, 20)>
- <22, (5, 10, 23)>
- <24, (6, 27, 28)>
- <26, (3, 16, 29)>
- <2, (18, 22, 23)>
- <5, (10, 22, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
