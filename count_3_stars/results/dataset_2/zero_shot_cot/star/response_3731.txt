Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 8) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 5, 11)>, <1, (6, 8, 10)>, <2, (0, 3, 12)>, <3, (2, 7, 14)>, <4, (9, 12, 13)>, <5, (0, 6, 13)>, <6, (1, 5, 10)>, <7, (3, 11, 14)>, <8, (1, 3, 10)>, <9, (4, 10, 12)>, <10, (1, 6, 8)>, <11, (0, 7, 4)>, <12, (2, 4, 9)>, <13, (2, 4, 5)>, <14, (3, 7, 4)>.

Hence, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
