Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 10) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 1) (18, 16) (18, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 3) (17, 19) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (19, 0) (19, 17) (19, 16) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 11) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 19) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are leaves in the given graph:
Node 1: connected to nodes 9, 11, 5
Node 4: connected to nodes 9, 10, 15
Node 7: connected to nodes 3, 10, 13
Node 8: connected to nodes 2, 13, 17, 12
Node 13: connected to nodes 7, 8, 12
Node 2: connected to nodes 8, 17, 0
Node 10: connected to nodes 4, 7, 15, 6, 5
Node 15: connected to nodes 4, 10
Node 9: connected to nodes 4, 16, 1
Node 18: connected to nodes 16, 6
Node 3: connected to nodes 7, 0, 17
Node 0: connected to nodes 2, 3, 19
Node 17: connected to nodes 8, 2, 3, 19
Node 11: connected to nodes 1, 5, 6
Node 19: connected to nodes 0, 17, 16
Node 5: connected to nodes 10, 1, 11
Node 16: connected to nodes 9, 18, 19
Node 12: connected to nodes 8, 13, 6
Node 6: connected to nodes 10, 18, 11, 12

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
There are 4 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<4, (9, 10, 15)>
<7, (3, 10, 13)>
<8, (2, 13, 17)>
<10, (4, 7, 15)>
