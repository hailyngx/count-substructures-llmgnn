Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (14, 3) (14, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 5) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 9) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (8, 15) (8, 18) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 2) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) (1, 18) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 10, 14)>
<3, (0, 7, 15)>
<4, (7, 9, 11)>
<5, (2, 12, 19)>
<11, (4, 16, 19)>
<18, (1, 8, 13)>
