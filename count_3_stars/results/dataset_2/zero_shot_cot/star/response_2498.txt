Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 26) (15, 0) (27, 10) (27, 2) (27, 5) (3, 28) (3, 7) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 29) (10, 27) (17, 1) (17, 4) (0, 15) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 9) (9, 22) (9, 20) (9, 28) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 8) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 9) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 16) (21, 2) (21, 24) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 5) (2, 27) (2, 21) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 27) (5, 16) (5, 2) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 25) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 13) (14, 12) (25, 22) (25, 11) (18, 23) (18, 13) (18, 8) (29, 23) (29, 6) (29, 4) (12, 26) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 12) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 29) (4, 24) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 4) (8, 26) (8, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Observing the edges information, we can identify the 3-stars:

<15, (1, 26, 0)>
<27, (10, 2, 5)>
<3, (28, 7, 0)>
<22, (23, 9, 25)>
<23, (18, 4, 29)>
<10, (27, 2, 5)>
<17, (1, 4, 0)>
<20, (0, 26, 9)>
<9, (22, 20, 28)>
<26, (15, 20, 8)>
<28, (3, 9, 1)>
<1, (15, 17, 7)>
<6, (21, 29, 12)>
<21, (6, 16, 2)>
<7, (3, 1, 2)>
<16, (21, 4, 5)>
<2, (27, 21, 5)>
<5, (27, 16, 2)>
<11, (19, 25, 13)>
<19, (6, 11, 24)>
<14, (12, 26, 13)>
<25, (22, 11, 23)>
<18, (23, 13, 8)>
<29, (23, 6, 4)>
<12, (26, 6, 14)>
<13, (11, 19, 18)>
<4, (23, 17, 16, 29)>
<24, (21, 19, 4)>
<8, (26, 18)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 30 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
