Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the central node in each 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of the center node connected to three other nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 

Here are the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 6
- Node 1
- Node 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars: 
<5, (2, 8, 3)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<1, (9, 6, 3)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 3)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
