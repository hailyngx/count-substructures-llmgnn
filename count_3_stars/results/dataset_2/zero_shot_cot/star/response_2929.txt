Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 17) (6, 1) (9, 16) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 7) (18, 15) (18, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 7) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (4, 11) (4, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (6, 8, 12)>
<8, (3, 10, 13)>
<10, (14, 15, 17)>
<12, (1, 4, 9)>
<13, (8, 16, 18)>
<14, (1, 10, 15)>
<15, (10, 17, 18)>
<16, (11, 13, 0)>
<17, (10, 15, 7)>
<18, (13, 15, 5)>
<19, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
