Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them since these nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 7
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 0

Next, let's list all the possible 3-stars in the graph:

<7, (4, 1, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (7, 3, 5)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (1, 9, 5)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [5].
