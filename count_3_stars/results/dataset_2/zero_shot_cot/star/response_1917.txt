Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <6, (1, 2, 7)>
2. <6, (3, 2, 1)>
3. <6, (2, 9, 7)>
4. <6, (8, 4, 1)>
5. <6, (7, 9, 5)>
6. <6, (2, 0, 5)>
7. <9, (8, 7, 2)>
8. <1, (6, 2, 4)>
9. <3, (6, 4, 0)>
10. <4, (1, 8, 0)>
11. <8, (9, 6, 0)>
12. <0, (4, 8, 5)>
13. <7, (6, 9, 5)>
14. <2, (6, 9, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
