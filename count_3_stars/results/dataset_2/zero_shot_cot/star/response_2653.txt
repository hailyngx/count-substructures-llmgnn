Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 5: (5, 1, 4), (5, 3, 0)
- From node 9: (9, 8, 4), (9, 3, 7)
- From node 4: (4, 8, 9), (4, 1, 6)
- From node 7: (7, 9, 3)
- From node 8: (8, 9, 4), (8, 0, 5), (8, 1, 6)
- From node 2: (2, 8, 0), (2, 6, 3)
- From node 0: (0, 5, 3), (0, 8, 1)
- From node 1: (1, 5, 4), (1, 8, 6)
- From node 6: (6, 4, 1), (6, 2, 3)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get 9. Therefore, the answer is [9].

Unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (1, 4, 3)>, 
<9, (8, 4, 3)>, 
<4, (8, 1, 6)>, 
<7, (9, 3)>, 
<8, (9, 4, 0)>, 
<2, (8, 0, 6)>, 
<0, (5, 8, 3)>, 
<1, (5, 4, 8)>, 
<6, (4, 2, 1)>
