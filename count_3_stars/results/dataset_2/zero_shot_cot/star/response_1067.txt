Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star in the graph, we need to find a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 9, 2, and 3
- Node 9 has edges to nodes 5, 8, and 4
- Node 4 has edges to nodes 9, 7, and 8
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 9, 4, and 2
- Node 0 has edges to nodes 9, 7, and 8
- Node 7 has edges to nodes 4, 0, and 6
- Node 1 has edges to nodes 2, 7, and 0
- Node 3 has edges to nodes 5, 8, and 0
- Node 6 has edges to nodes 7, 8, and 0

Now, we can see the following 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 0)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>

There are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
