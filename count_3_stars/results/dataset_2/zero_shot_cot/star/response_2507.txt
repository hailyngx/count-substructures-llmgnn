Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 12) (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 6) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 17) (20, 12) (20, 21) (25, 17) (25, 12) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 24) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 0) (17, 7) (17, 25) (17, 1) (17, 3) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 3) (21, 20) (21, 6) (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16) (10, 29) (2, 22) (2, 26) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 27) (28, 8) (28, 0) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 12) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (5, 0) (5, 16) (27, 19) (27, 18) (27, 26) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 26) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 29) (26, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 12) (12, 13) (12, 20) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 0) (24, 8) (24, 15) (24, 18) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 9) (18, 7) (18, 27) (18, 24) (14, 1) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 26) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the steps to identify the 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.

- Node 0 has edges: (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 12)
- Node 3 has edges: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 29)
- Node 4 has edges: (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16)
- Node 6 has edges: (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 3)
- Node 8 has edges: (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 24)
- Node 11 has edges: (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 12)
- Node 12 has edges: (12, 13) (12, 20) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 0)
- Node 13 has edges: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 12)
- Node 15 has edges: (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16)
- Node 17 has edges: (17, 7) (17, 25) (17, 1) (17, 3)
- Node 19 has edges: (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 27)
- Node 21 has edges: (21, 20) (21, 6)
- Node 22 has edges: (22, 13) (22, 2) (22, 6)
- Node 23 has edges: (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 9)
- Node 24 has edges: (24, 8) (24, 15) (24, 18)
- Node 26 has edges: (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 29) (26, 16)
- Node 28 has edges: (28, 8) (28, 0)
- Node 29 has edges: (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 26)

2. Identify the 3-stars by looking at nodes with three edges connected to them and their neighboring nodes.

- The 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 12, 19)>
<3, (17, 6, 23)>
<4, (19, 16, 23)>
<6, (22, 21, 3)>
<8, (13, 24, 28)>
<11, (7, 26, 12)>
<12, (13, 25, 11)>
<13, (22, 12, 8)>
<15, (1, 24, 16)>
<17, (7, 25, 1)>
<19, (4, 27, 0)>
<21, (20, 6)>
<22, (13, 6, 2)>
<23, (4, 3, 9)>
<24, (8, 15, 18)>
<26, (2, 16, 27)>
<28, (8, 0)>
<29, (10, 26, 3)>

To find the total number of 3-stars, we count the unique occurrences. There are [18] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
