Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 10) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 0: <8, (4, 2, 0)>
2. Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 9: <13, (4, 3, 9)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 3: <4, (8, 13, 3)>
4. Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 5, and 9: <2, (8, 5, 9)>
5. Node 3 is connected to nodes 13, 4, and 11: <3, (13, 4, 11)>
6. Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 14: <11, (2, 3, 14)>
7. Node 9 is connected to nodes 13, 2, and 10: <9, (13, 2, 10)>
8. Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 14: <1, (11, 6, 14)>
9. Node 7 is connected to nodes 13, 2, and 14: <7, (13, 2, 14)>
10. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 11: <5, (2, 3, 11)>
11. Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 10: <12, (9, 5, 10)>

[Number of 3-stars: [11]]
