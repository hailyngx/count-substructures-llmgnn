Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Check all nodes in the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes (2, 3, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes (0, 1, 8, 9)
- Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes (1, 4, 5, 9)
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes (3, 5, 8)
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes (0, 3, 4)
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 7, 8)
- Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes (1, 6, 9)
- Node 8 is connected to 5 other nodes (0, 2, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 9 is connected to 6 other nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8)
- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes (2, 5, 8, 9)

2. Identify 3-stars:
- Based on the connections, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 0)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: [8] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
