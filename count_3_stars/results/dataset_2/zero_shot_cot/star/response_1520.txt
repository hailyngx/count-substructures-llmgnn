Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 8) (27, 4) (27, 24) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 6) (7, 15) (7, 6) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 17) (19, 26) (19, 9) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 13) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 13) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 29) (18, 26) (18, 29) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 7) (21, 3) (21, 25) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 23) (10, 22) (10, 16) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 12) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 24) (2, 17) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 29) (22, 10) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 9) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 9) (20, 16) (14, 23) (14, 8) (24, 27) (24, 2) (24, 0) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 20) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 4) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 25, and 26. <1, (5, 25, 26)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 17, and 20. <2, (11, 17, 20)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 27. <4, (5, 6, 27)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 15, and 27. <7, (6, 15, 27)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 14, 15, and 28. <8, (14, 15, 28)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 19, 20, and 25. <9, (19, 20, 25)>
7. Node 10 is connected to nodes 16, 20, and 22. <10, (16, 20, 22)>
8. Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 23, and 29. <12, (2, 23, 29)>
9. Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 28, and 29. <13, (5, 28, 29)>
10. Node 18 is connected to nodes 26, 29, and 18. <18, (26, 29, 18)>
11. Node 21 is connected to nodes 3, 25, and 21. <21, (3, 25, 21)>
12. Node 24 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 27. <24, (0, 2, 27)>
