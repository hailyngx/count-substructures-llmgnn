Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

- Node 6 has 5 edges: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 0)
  <6, (9, 5, 3)>
- Node 9 has 5 edges: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1)
  <9, (6, 8, 4)>
- Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8)
- Node 7 has 4 edges: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 1)
- Node 8 has 5 edges: (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 5)
  <8, (6, 9, 4)>
- Node 2 has 2 edges: (2, 5), (2, 1)

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph. 
<6, (9, 5, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <8, (6, 9, 4)>
