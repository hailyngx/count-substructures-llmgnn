Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (9, 23) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 11) (5, 1) (5, 7) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 18) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (21, 6) (21, 8) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 29) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 27) (20, 23) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 22) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 24) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 19) (6, 27) (4, 3) (4, 16) (27, 20) (27, 6) (27, 18) (27, 1) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 2) (13, 20) (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 1) (17, 28) (17, 19) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 22) (14, 2) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 23) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 25) (16, 10) (1, 5) (1, 27) (1, 13) (29, 26) (29, 0) (29, 13) (25, 16) (22, 12) (22, 14) (23, 9) (23, 20) (23, 19) (8, 21) (24, 0) (24, 28) (10, 3) (10, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 3 (connected to 11, 15, 4)
- Node 6 (connected to 7, 21, 27)
- Node 7 (connected to 5, 12, 14)
- Node 12 (connected to 7, 13, 16)
- Node 13 (connected to 20, 12, 1)
- Node 14 (connected to 9, 26, 7)
- Node 16 (connected to 12, 4, 10)
- Node 18 (connected to 15, 27, 19)
- Node 19 (connected to 6, 17, 23)
- Node 20 (connected to 0, 13, 23)
- Node 26 (connected to 28, 14, 29)
- Node 27 (connected to 20, 6, 1)
- Node 29 (connected to 26, 0, 13)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (11, 15, 4)>
<6, (7, 21, 27)>
<7, (5, 12, 14)>
<12, (7, 13, 16)>
<13, (20, 12, 1)>
<14, (9, 26, 7)>
<16, (12, 4, 10)>
<18, (15, 27, 19)>
<19, (6, 17, 23)>
<20, (0, 13, 23)>
<26, (28, 14, 29)>
<27, (20, 6, 1)>
<29, (26, 0, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
