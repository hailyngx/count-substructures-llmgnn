Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
Given graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. Let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 0, and 6: <4, (7, 0, 6)>
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 6: <7, (4, 9, 6)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 1: <6, (4, 9, 1)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 1: <9, (7, 6, 1)>
5. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 5: <0, (4, 3, 5)>
6. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 9: <1, (4, 6, 9)>
7. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 3: <2, (5, 1, 3)>
8. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 3: <8, (6, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
