Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, there are 4 different 3-stars. 

The 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 3)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
