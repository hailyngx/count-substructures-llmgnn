Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Let's identify and count them.

1. <1, (3, 4, 7)>
2. <3, (1, 4, 7)>
3. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
4. <7, (1, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
