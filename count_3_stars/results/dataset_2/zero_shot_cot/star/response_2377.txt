Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present. 

1. <4, (8, 6, 2)>
2. <7, (0, 3, 13)>
3. <8, (4, 7, 0)>
4. <5, (6, 13, 2)>
5. <6, (8, 5, 1)>
6. <0, (7, 8, 5)>
7. <14, (5, 1, 12)>
8. <3, (7, 6, 0)>
9. <13, (7, 5, 12)>
10. <12, (4, 5, 14)>
11. <1, (6, 14, 12)>
12. <2, (4, 5, 13)>
13. <9, (4, 3, 11)>
14. <10, (12, 2, 0)>

Hence, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
