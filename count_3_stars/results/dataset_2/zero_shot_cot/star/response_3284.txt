Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <5, (0, 7, 10)>, <9, (1, 12, 13)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <7, (3, 4, 11)>, <6, (4, 13, 14)>, and <1, (2, 3, 9)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
