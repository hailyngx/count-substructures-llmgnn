Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observing the provided edges, we can infer the following 3-stars:

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<4, (8, 10, 11)>
<5, (1, 6, 14)>
<6, (4, 5, 10)>
<7, (3, 8, 11)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<10, (0, 4, 6)>
<11, (3, 4, 14)>
<12, (1, 2, 9)>
<13, (0, 3, 7)>
<14, (4, 10, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
