Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 17) (0, 2) (27, 22) (27, 9) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 21) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 18) (23, 1) (28, 29) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 12) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 4) (26, 23) (26, 19) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (6, 21) (6, 7) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 15) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 24) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 10) (4, 19) (4, 13) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 1) (16, 27) (16, 24) (16, 2) (16, 15) (24, 5) (24, 16) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 9) (1, 23) (1, 10) (1, 13) (14, 20) (14, 28) (14, 22) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 28) (22, 14) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 13) (15, 21) (15, 16) (9, 27) (9, 2) (9, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 18) (12, 29) (12, 3) (12, 21) (12, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (2, 17, 27)>
<27, (22, 16, 9)>
<20, (25, 14, 22)>
<25, (20, 21, 5)>
<8, (23, 10, 5)>
<23, (26, 18, 1)>
<28, (29, 14, 19)>
<29, (5, 12, 28)>
<17, (18, 0, 7)>
<19, (4, 28, 26)>
<26, (19, 23, 9)>
<3, (11, 12, 6)>
<11, (3)>
<6, (21, 7)>
<21, (25, 12, 6)>
<5, (29, 24, 8)>
<7, (6, 17, 10)>
<4, (19, 13)>
<10, (1, 7, 8)>
<16, (24, 2, 15)>
<24, (5, 16)>
<2, (9, 16, 0)>
<1, (10, 13, 23)>
<14, (22, 20, 28)>
<22, (14, 27, 28)>
<18, (13, 17, 10)>

Count of 3-stars: [26]
