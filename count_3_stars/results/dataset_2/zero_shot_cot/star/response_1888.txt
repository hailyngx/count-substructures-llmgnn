Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 29) (27, 22) (27, 26) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (10, 23) (10, 25) (10, 29) (17, 21) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 28) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 8) (5, 11) (5, 28) (5, 20) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 23) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 26) (28, 2) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 23) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 25) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 24) (24, 26) (24, 20) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 3) (9, 4) (11, 5) (11, 23) (23, 10) (23, 14) (23, 28) (23, 11) (16, 2) (16, 28) (16, 19) (25, 10) (25, 22) (25, 13) (19, 16) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 20) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 22) (29, 15) (29, 10) (20, 5) (20, 24) (20, 12) (20, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 13) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (14, 15, 21)>
<2, (3, 18, 28)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (11, 20, 28)>
<7, (6, 15, 22)>
<8, (0, 12, 18)>
<10, (23, 25, 29)>
<13, (4, 13, 25)>
<16, (2, 19, 28)>
<17, (7, 21, 27)>
<20, (12, 13, 24)>
<26, (21, 24, 27)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [12].
