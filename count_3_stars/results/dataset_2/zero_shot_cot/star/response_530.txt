Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 5 is connected to 4, 8, 0, 3. This forms a 3-star: <5, (4, 8, 0)>.
2. Node 9 is connected to 4, 2, 3. This forms a 3-star: <9, (4, 2, 3)>.
3. Node 6 is connected to 1, 7, 3, 2, 4. This forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 7, 3)>.
4. Node 1 is connected to 6, 3, 4. This forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 3, 4)>.
5. Node 3 is connected to 5, 9, 6, 1, 0. This forms a 3-star: <3, (5, 9, 6)>.
6. Node 4 is connected to 5, 9, 6, 1, 8, 2. This forms a 3-star: <4, (5, 9, 6)>.
7. Node 8 is connected to 5, 4, 0. This forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 4, 0)>.
8. Node 0 is connected to 5, 3, 8, 2. This forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 3, 8)>.
9. Node 2 is connected to 9, 6, 4, 0, 7. This forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 6, 4)>.
10. Node 7 is connected to 6, 2. This node is not part of any 3-star pattern.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 10 unique 3-stars:

<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<8, (5, 4, 0)>
<0, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
