Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 16) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 2) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 15) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (15, 11) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 3) (12, 1) (16, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Considering the given edges, nodes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16 are such nodes.

2. For each of these nodes, list out the edges to find the 3-stars:
   - For central node 1: (1, 13), (1, 10), (1, 19), (1, 12).
     <1, (13, 10, 19)>
     <1, (13, 10, 12)>
   - For central node 5: (5, 14).
     <5, (14, 14, 14)>
   - For central node 6: (6, 14), (6, 4), (6, 16).
     <6, (14, 4, 16)>
   - For central node 7: (7, 9), (7, 3).
     <7, (9, 3, 3)>
   - For central node 8: (8, 13), (8, 3).
     <8, (13, 3, 3)>
   - For central node 16: (16, 6).
     <16, (6, 6, 6)>

3. Count all unique 3-stars:
