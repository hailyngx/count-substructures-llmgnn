Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 4) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (1, 0) (1, 17) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 14) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 16) (16, 12) (16, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (6, 18) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by examining the nodes. 

We have the following 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 14)>
<2, (0, 4, 18)>
<4, (0, 10, 2)>
<7, (11, 14, 16)>
<10, (4, 15, 19)>
<11, (7, 8, 10)>
<12, (4, 16, 19)>
<13, (8, 15, 19)>
<14, (0, 3, 7)>
<15, (10, 13, 14)>
<16, (7, 12, 19)>
<18, (2, 6, 9)>
<19, (3, 12, 16)>

Therefore, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
