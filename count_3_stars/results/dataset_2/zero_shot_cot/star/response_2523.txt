Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 10, and 14.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 14, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 11, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 13, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 14, 11, and 5.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 14, 2, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking at each potential 3-star centered at the mentioned nodes:

- 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (5, 9, 10)> [1]
- 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (9, 11, 14)> [1]
- 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (5, 10, 11)> [1]
- 3-star centered at node 3: Not a 3-star since node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes.
- 3-star centered at node 4: Not a 3-star since node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes.
- 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (6, 0, 11)> [1]
- 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (5, 2, 8)> [1]

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
