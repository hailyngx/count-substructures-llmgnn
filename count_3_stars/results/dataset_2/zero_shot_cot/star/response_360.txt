Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 20) (3, 25) (3, 12) (3, 22) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 16) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 23) (29, 9) (29, 28) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 0) (13, 25) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (14, 8) (14, 1) (26, 10) (26, 21) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 23) (22, 3) (22, 19) (22, 27) (18, 3) (18, 8) (24, 25) (24, 13) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 15) (4, 2) (4, 23) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (20, 9) (20, 27) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 27) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 23) (27, 22) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 21) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 23) (23, 28) (23, 19) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 15) (12, 3) (12, 28) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star.

Let's start by manually identifying the 3-stars based on the given edges:

- For node 1: <1, (0, 11, 14)>
- For node 2: <2, (4, 15, 19)>
- For node 3: <3, (12, 18, 22)>
- For node 5: <5, (9, 15, 16)>
- For node 7: <7, (0, 10, 21)>
- For node 8: <8, (14, 18, 27)>
- For node 9: <9, (5, 20, 29)>
- For node 10: <10, (7, 17, 26)>
- For node 11: <11, (1, 2, 28)>
- For node 13: <13, (16, 17, 24)>
- For node 15: <15, (2, 5, 23)>
- For node 16: <16, (5, 13, 17)>
- For node 17: <17, (10, 13, 16)>
- For node 18: <18, (3, 8, 22)>
- For node 19: <19, (2, 23, 27)>
- For node 21: <21, (0, 21, 26)>
- For node 22: <22, (3, 19, 27)>
- For node 23: <23, (4, 15, 21)>
- For node 24: <24, (13, 25, 4)>
- For node 25: <25, (1, 13, 24)>
- For node 26: <26, (10, 21, 27)>
- For node 27: <27, (8, 19, 21)>
- For node 28: <28, (11, 23, 29)>
- For node 29: <29, (9, 28, 20)>

Next, count the total number of unique 3-stars found. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
