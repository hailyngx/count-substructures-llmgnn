Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 19) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 12) (23, 20) (23, 8) (23, 27) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 24) (18, 28) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 17) (26, 18) (26, 2) (13, 21) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 6) (24, 18) (24, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 20) (10, 25) (10, 21) (10, 14) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 1) (2, 5) (2, 22) (2, 26) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 12) (7, 3) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 10) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 6) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 29) (12, 25) (12, 8) (12, 0) (28, 4) (28, 18) 

Response:
At first, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

1 is connected to: 17, 29, 27
2 is connected to: 5, 22, 26
3 is connected to: 15, 7, 0, 22
4 is connected to: 8, 18, 28
5 is connected to: 9, 19, 2, 27
6 is connected to: 11, 15, 13, 17, 29
7 is connected to: 3
8 is connected to: 23, 4, 12
9 is connected to: 5, 14, 20
10 is connected to: 25, 21, 14
11 is connected to: 19, 6
12 is connected to: 25, 8, 0
13 is connected to: 21, 6
14 is connected to: 16, 9, 10
15 is connected to: 3, 6, 17
16 is connected to: 14
17 is connected to: 15, 22, 1, 6
18 is connected to: 4, 26, 24, 28
19 is connected to: 11, 5, 20
20 is connected to: 9, 25, 19, 23
21 is connected to: 13, 10, 29
22 is connected to: 3, 2, 17
23 is connected to: 8, 20, 27
24 is connected to: 18, 0
25 is connected to: 20, 27, 12, 10
26 is connected to: 18, 2
27 is connected to: 5, 25, 23, 1
28 is connected to: 4, 18
29 is connected to: 1, 21, 6

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<5, (9, 19, 27)>
<9, (5, 14, 20)>
<10, (25, 21, 14)>
<14, (16, 9, 10)>
<17, (15, 22, 1)>
<18, (4, 26, 28)>
<21, (13, 29, 10)>
<27, (5, 25, 23)>
<29, (1, 21, 6)>
<6, (11, 15, 13)>
<8, (23, 4, 12)>
<2, (5, 22, 26)>
<3, (15, 7, 0)>
<0, (3, 24, 12)>
<4, (8, 18, 28)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
