Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify each 3-star configuration and then count them. 

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 9, 0)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 1, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<7, (3, 8, 2)>

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
