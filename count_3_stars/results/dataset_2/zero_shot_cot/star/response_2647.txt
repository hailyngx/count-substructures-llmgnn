Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star in this graph must have degree 3 and its adjacent nodes must have degree 1.

Let's go step by step through the nodes to identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 has degree 4, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has degree 4, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
3. Node 2 has degree 4, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.
4. Node 3 is adjacent to nodes 6, 9, 4, and 5.
5. Node 4 is adjacent to nodes 9, 1, 3, and 0.
6. Node 5 is adjacent to nodes 6, 3, and 8.
7. Node 6 is adjacent to nodes 9, 5, and 3.
8. Node 7 has degree 3, but its adjacent nodes have degrees 3, 4, and 4, so it cannot form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 is adjacent to nodes 6, 1, 7, 5, and 2.
10. Node 9 is adjacent to nodes 6, 4, 2, and 3.

Based on the analysis above, we can see that the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<3, (6, 9, 4)>
<3, (6, 9, 5)>
<3, (6, 4, 0)>
<3, (6, 5, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<8, (6, 1, 7)>
<8, (6, 1, 5)>
<8, (6, 7, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
