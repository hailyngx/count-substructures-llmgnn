Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.
1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 0)
2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 7), (9, 0)
3. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3)
4. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2)
5. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 8)
6. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 8)
7. Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8)
8. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 6)
9. Node 2: (2, 7), (2, 3), (2, 8)
10. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 1)

Next, count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 
To form a 3-star, the central node must have exactly 3 connecting edges. 
From above, we have 9 potential central nodes for 3-stars, but not all of them form valid 3-stars.

Count: [5] 
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
