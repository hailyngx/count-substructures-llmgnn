Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 9) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 14) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 28) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 0) (23, 26) (23, 18) (23, 4) (17, 29) (17, 0) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 12) (0, 8) (0, 17) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 14) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 15) (20, 11) (20, 27) (20, 5) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 15) (10, 27) (15, 11) (15, 22) (15, 10) (15, 13) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 28) (26, 23) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 25) (4, 23) (4, 2) (27, 29) (27, 20) (27, 10) (27, 28) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 25) (18, 13) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 2) (28, 7) (28, 2) (28, 27) (28, 19) (12, 29) (12, 24) (12, 18) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 20) (25, 24) (25, 18) (19, 7) (19, 28) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is directly connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list out all the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (9, 14, 21)>
<2, (4, 6, 22)>
<3, (5, 13, 18)>
<7, (19, 21, 28)>
<10, (15, 22, 27)>
<11, (15, 16, 20)>
<12, (18, 24, 29)>
<16, (6, 11, 24)>
<17, (0, 17, 29)>
<20, (11, 20, 27)>
<21, (1, 7, 10)>
<22, (10, 15, 22)>
<23, (4, 18, 26)>
<24, (12, 16, 25)>
<27, (10, 20, 27)>
<28, (7, 19, 27)>
<29, (12, 17, 29)>

Since each 3-star only needs to be counted once, we have found 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
