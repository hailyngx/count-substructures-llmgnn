Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 13) (22, 23) (22, 20) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 27) (17, 10) (17, 24) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 16) (20, 22) (20, 15) (20, 7) (21, 0) (28, 14) (28, 13) (26, 25) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 1) (19, 8) (19, 16) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 4) (18, 15) (18, 25) (18, 1) (3, 22) (3, 27) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 27) (7, 1) (1, 23) (1, 8) (1, 18) (1, 7) (1, 29) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 25) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 14) (2, 25) (0, 21) (0, 6) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 0) (24, 17) (24, 13) (25, 26) (25, 18) (25, 29) (25, 2) (25, 14) (27, 11) (27, 23) (27, 3) (27, 7) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 2) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 14) (14, 28) (14, 2) (14, 25) (14, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with three incident edges:
- Nodes 5, 10, 23 have 3 incident edges.
- Nodes 1, 8, 15, 16, 27 have 4 incident edges. We will need to check their connections for potential 3-stars.

2. Check nodes with 3 incident edges:
- <5, (9, 2, 4)>
- <10, (11, 17, 8)>
- <23, (22, 1, 6)>

3. Check nodes with 4 incident edges:
- Node 1:
  - (1, 23), (1, 8), (1, 18)
  - No additional 3-star.
- Node 8:
  - (8, 10), (8, 19), (8, 16)
  - <8, (10, 19, 16)>
- Node 15:
  - (15, 20), (15, 18), (15, 6)
  - No additional 3-star.
- Node 16:
  - (16, 15), (16, 8), (16, 19)
  - No additional 3-star.
- Node 27:
  - (27, 11), (27, 23), (27, 3)
  - No additional 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<10, (11, 17, 8)>
<23, (22, 1, 6)>
<8, (10, 19, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
