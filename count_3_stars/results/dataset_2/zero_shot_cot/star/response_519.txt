Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 12) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in order to form a 3-star. We will then count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes and their connections to the center node are as follows:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 8
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 13, 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 11
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 10
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 5
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 10
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 11
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 10
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 14
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 3
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 5
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 5
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 11
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[There are a total of <6, (10, 11, 8)>, <9, (2, 13, 12)>, <4, (7, 0, 11)>, <7, (4, 0, 10)>, <1, (3, 14, 5)>, <3, (4, 1, 10)>, <5, (1, 13, 11)>, <2, (9, 13, 10)>, <8, (6, 1, 14)>, <13, (9, 7, 3)>, <0, (4, 7, 5)>, and <11, (6, 4, 5)> 3-stars in the graph, so the answer is [11].]
