Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 5, and 2. <6, (9, 5, 2)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 1. <9, (6, 4, 1)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 0. <4, (9, 8, 0)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 2, and 7.  <8, (4, 2, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 1. <5, (6, 4, 1)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 3. <2, (6, 8, 3)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 2, and 7. <0, (4, 2, 7)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 0. <7, (9, 8, 0)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 5, and 7. <1, (9, 5, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 7. <3, (6, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [10].
