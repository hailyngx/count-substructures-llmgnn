Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6, 13}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 10}
- Node 2: {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 4: {2, 7, 10, 14}
- Node 5: {0, 8, 13}
- Node 6: {0, 3, 8, 9, 11, 13}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 4, 12, 14}
- Node 8: {2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11}
- Node 9: {2, 3, 6, 11}
- Node 10: {1, 4, 8, 10, 13}
- Node 11: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 12: {7, 13}
- Node 13: {0, 5, 6, 10, 12}
- Node 14: {4, 7}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Total number of 3-stars: [9]
- Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 5, 13)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 8, 13)>
<7, (4, 12, 14)>
<8, (5, 10, 11)>
<10, (1, 4, 13)>
<12, (7, 13, 14)>
<13, (0, 5, 6)>
<14, (4, 7, 12)>
