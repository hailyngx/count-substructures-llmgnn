Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 14) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 13) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (10, 16) (10, 8) (12, 5) (12, 13) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (19, 15) (19, 7) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 7) 

Response:
Considering that a 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the given graph and count them. Let's proceed step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges:
- Nodes 11, 16, 15, 6, 4, 8, 14, and 2 have more than three edges, so they cannot be central nodes of 3-stars.
- Nodes 9, 10, 5, 17, 1, 13, 12, 0, and 19 have exactly three edges, these are potential central nodes.

2. Forming 3-stars:
- Considering each potential central node, we can find the corresponding leaves based on the given edges.

3. Count the 3-stars:
- Count the total number of distinct 3-stars in the graph.

Let's proceed with identifying and counting the 3-stars. 

[The number of 3-stars is: [3]]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (14, 1, 11)>
<5, (4, 2, 12)>
<7, (8, 18, 19)>
