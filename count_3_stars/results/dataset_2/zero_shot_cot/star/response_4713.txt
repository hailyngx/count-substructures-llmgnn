Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 2) (16, 4) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 0) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 17) (19, 1) (19, 18) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 18) (14, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 0) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 17, and 15: <10, (1, 17, 15)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 5, and 15: <17, (10, 5, 15)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 19, and 6: <18, (4, 19, 6)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
