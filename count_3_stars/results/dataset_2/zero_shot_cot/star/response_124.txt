Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3 because they will be the centers of the 3-stars. 
The nodes with degree 3 are 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 0.

Now, let's find the 3-stars by checking each central node and its connected nodes. 
- For node 5: (5, 9, 2), (5, 9, 8), (5, 9, 0)
- For node 9: (9, 5, 6), (9, 5, 4), (9, 5, 3), (9, 5, 7), (9, 5, 0)
- For node 4: (4, 9, 7), (4, 9, 0)
- For node 7: (7, 9, 6), (7, 9, 4), (7, 9, 3)
- For node 3: (3, 9, 8), (3, 9, 7), (3, 9, 1)
- For node 6: (6, 9, 7), (6, 9, 2)
- For node 0: (0, 5, 8), (0, 5, 9), (0, 9, 4), (0, 9, 8)

So, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
- <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <9, (5, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>
- <4, (9, 7, 0)>
- <7, (9, 6, 4)>, <7, (9, 6, 3)>
- <3, (9, 8, 1)>
- <6, (9, 7, 2)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (9, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
