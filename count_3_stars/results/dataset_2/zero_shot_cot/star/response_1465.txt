Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
So first, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars by finding nodes with exactly three neighbors. 
Here are the nodes with three neighbors: 
- Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 12, 4, 0, 3, 10
- Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 8, 4, 11, 7
- Node 10 has neighbors: 5, 11, 6, 7, 13
- Node 11 has neighbors: 9, 10, 6, 12
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 4, 6, 14, 13, 7
- Node 6 has neighbors: 10, 11, 8, 1, 14
- Node 7 has neighbors: 9, 10, 2, 8, 3, 1
- Node 14 has neighbors: 2, 1, 6, 13
- Node 13 has neighbors: 10, 1, 14

Based on the above, let's list the 3-star structures found in the given graph:

<5, (9, 12, 4)>
<10, (5, 11, 6)>
<1, (2, 4, 14)>
<7, (9, 2, 8)>
