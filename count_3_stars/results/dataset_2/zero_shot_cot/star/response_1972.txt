Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 0), (1, 8) -> <1, (3, 6, 10)>
2. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 14), (3, 4) -> <3, (1, 11, 7)>
3. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 13), (8, 14), (8, 6), (8, 7) -> <8, (1, 13, 14)>
4. Node 13: (13, 1), (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 4), (13, 0) -> <13, (1, 8, 12)>
5. Node 10: (10, 1), (10, 12), (10, 2) -> <10, (1, 12, 2)>
6. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 10), (2, 6), (2, 12) -> <2, (9, 10, 6)>
7. Node 11: (11, 5), (11, 3), (11, 7), (11, 0) -> <11, (5, 3, 7)>
8. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 14), (6, 2) -> <6, (1, 8, 14)>
9. Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 13), (4, 0) -> <4, (3, 13, 0)>
10. Node 12: (12, 13), (12, 10), (12, 2) -> <12, (13, 10, 2)>
11. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 11), (5, 14) -> <5, (9, 11, 14)>
12. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 11), (7, 14) -> <7, (3, 8, 11)>
13. Node 14: (14, 5), (14, 3), (14, 8), (14, 6), (14, 7) -> <14, (5, 3, 8)>
14. Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 13), (0, 11), (0, 4) -> <0, (1, 13, 11)>
