Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the given edges, we find the following unique 3-star structures in the graph:

<1, (4, 7, 14)>
<2, (4, 6, 11)>
<3, (5, 14, -)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 12)>
<6, (2, 5, 10)>
<7, (4, 10, 11)>
<8, (4, 8, 12)>
<9, (4, 8, 11)>
<10, (0, 6, 7)>
<11, (2, 7, 9)>
<12, (0, 5, 14)>
<13, (1, 11, -)>
<14, (1, 7, 12)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found: [14].
