Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<4, (1, 7, 0)>
<7, (6, 9, 3)>
<8, (9, 1, 2)>
<5, (6, 3, 2)>
<2, (9, 1, 7)>
<0, (7, 8, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [10].
