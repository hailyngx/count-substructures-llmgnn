Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 0) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 12) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 1) (7, 17) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for vertices that are connected to exactly three other vertices. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 6, 17, and 10: <9, (6, 17, 10)>
2. Vertex 10 is connected to vertices 9, 5, and 15: <10, (9, 5, 15)>
3. Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 5, 15, and 12: <8, (5, 15, 12)>
4. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 13, 14, and 8: <4, (13, 14, 8)>
5. Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 19, 14, and 10: <2, (19, 14, 10)>

There are a total of 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
