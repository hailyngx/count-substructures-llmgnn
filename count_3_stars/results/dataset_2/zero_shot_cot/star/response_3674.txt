Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.
2. For each node identified in step 1:
   a. Check the nodes connected to it by edges.
   b. If three connected nodes form a 3-star with the identified node as the center, count it.
3. Output the final count.

Here are the steps broken down based on the given graph:

Nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them: 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7
(Note: Nodes 5, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 are potential centers of 3-stars.)

Potential 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- <9, (5, 2, 1)>
- <4, (5, 7, 3)>
- <7, (5, 4, 0)>
- <6, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (9, 4, 0)>
- <0, (7, 2, 8)>
- <1, (5, 9, 2)>
- <3, (4, 2, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
