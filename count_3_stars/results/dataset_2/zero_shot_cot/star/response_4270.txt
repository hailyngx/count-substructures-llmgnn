Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 1, as these nodes can be the centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with degree 1: 7, 0

Next, let's check each node from the list above and see if they have exactly three neighbors. 

For node 7: (7, 6), (7, 1) are the only edges incident to node 7. So, node 7 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

For node 0: (0, 4), (0, 8), (0, 3) are the only edges incident to node 0. So, node 0 can be the center of a 3-star. The 3-star centered at node 0 will have leaves 4, 8, 3.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (4, 8, 3)>
