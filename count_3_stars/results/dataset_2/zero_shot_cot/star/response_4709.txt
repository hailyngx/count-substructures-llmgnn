Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 9) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 15) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 5) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 19) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 14) (14, 2) (14, 5) (19, 1) (19, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 16) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 9) (18, 10) (18, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges.
Let's iterate through all nodes and check if they are connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star.

The nodes that form a 3-star are:
- Node 1: (1, 8), (1, 15), (1, 16)
- Node 3: (3, 8), (3, 11), (3, 16)
- Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 2), (5, 15), (5, 12), (5, 14)
- Node 6: (6, 10), (6, 17), (6, 18), (6, 16)
- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 9), (7, 17)
- Node 8: (8, 13), (8, 3), (8, 1)
- Node 9: (9, 7), (9, 10), (9, 16)
- Node 10: (10, 17), (10, 6), (10, 18), (10, 9)
- Node 11: (11, 13), (11, 3), (11, 15)
- Node 12: (12, 0), (12, 5), (12, 19)
- Node 13: (13, 8), (13, 11)
- Node 14: (14, 2), (14, 5)
- Node 15: (15, 4), (15, 11), (15, 1), (15, 5)
- Node 16: (16, 3), (16, 1), (16, 6), (16, 9)
- Node 17: (17, 7), (17, 10), (17, 6)
- Node 19: (19, 1), (19, 12)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (8, 15, 16)>
<3, (8, 11, 16)>
<5, (2, 4, 15)>
<6, (10, 17, 18)>
<7, (0, 9, 17)>
<8, (1, 3, 13)>
<9, (7, 10, 16)>
<10, (6, 9, 17)>
<11, (3, 13, 15)>
<12, (0, 5, 19)>
<13, (8, 11, 13)>
<14, (2, 5, 14)>
<15, (1, 4, 5)>
<16, (1, 3, 9)>
<17, (6, 7, 10)>
<19, (1, 12, 19)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
