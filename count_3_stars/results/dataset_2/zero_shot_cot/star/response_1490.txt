Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. The central node needs to be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can see that nodes 6, 4, 7, and 3 are connected to exactly three other nodes each, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.

Now, let's identify the leaves of each potential 3-star based on the central nodes:

- For central node 6:
  - Leaves: 9, 5, 7, 3, 4, 0
  - Possible 3-stars: <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (9, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 4, 0)> 

- For central node 4:
  - Leaves: 6, 8, 5, 3, 2
  - Possible 3-stars: <4, (6, 8, 5)>, <4, (6, 3, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 3)>

- For central node 7:
  - Leaves: 6, 9, 3, 2
  - Possible 3-star: <7, (6, 9, 3)>

- For central node 3:
  - Leaves: 6, 4, 7, 2
  - Possible 3-star: <3, (6, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found a total of 7 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
Unique 3-stars: <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (9, 3, 4)>, <6, (9, 7, 0)>, <6, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 4, 0)>, <4, (6, 8, 5)>, <4, (6, 3, 2)>, <4, (8, 5, 3)>, <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <3, (6, 4, 7)>
