Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 5) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 9) (17, 23) (3, 25) (3, 29) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 15) (18, 22) (18, 14) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 5) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 8) (23, 2) (15, 25) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 11) (20, 17) (20, 11) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 27) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 10) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 4) (26, 19) (26, 10) (26, 4) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 0) (29, 17) (29, 3) (29, 6) (4, 1) (4, 26) (4, 24) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 16) (0, 19) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 2) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 11) (16, 27) (16, 0) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 10) (9, 17) (9, 15) (28, 13) (28, 27) (10, 6) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 12) (24, 4) (24, 7) (11, 15) (11, 20) (11, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:
1. Count the degree of each node:
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 5
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 29: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 21: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2

2. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (degree 4):
- <5, (14, 8, 15, 27)>
- <10, (6, 26, 2, 12)>
- <0, (19, 7, 16, 21)>
- <23, (14, 17, 8, 2)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<5, (14, 8, 15, 27)>, <10, (6, 26, 2, 12)>, <0, (19, 7, 16, 21)>, <23, (14, 17, 8, 2)>>.
