Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. We know that in a 3-star, the center has exactly 3 edges connected to other nodes.  

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (1, 4, 0)>
<9, (3, 7, 0)>
<6, (8, 0, -)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 3)>
<8, (6, 2, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
