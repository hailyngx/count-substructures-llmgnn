Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 24) (13, 0) (22, 0) (22, 3) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 27) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 22) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 26) (20, 5) (25, 19) (8, 4) (8, 18) (8, 27) (26, 3) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 17) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 16) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 16) (28, 0) (28, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 24) (12, 14) (5, 20) (5, 2) (19, 25) (19, 6) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 23) (16, 29) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 2) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 16) (21, 11) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 14) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 29) (27, 6) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 11) (6, 19) (6, 27) (6, 14) (6, 23) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (24, 13) (24, 12) (24, 10) (11, 21) (11, 0) (11, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 28) (23, 10) (23, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star structures in the given graph.

<3, (1, 4, 22)>
<7, (12, 15, 27)>
<12, (7, 14, 17)>
<14, (1, 2, 6)>
<16, (15, 21, 29)>
<18, (1, 8, 15)>
<21, (13, 16, 26)>
<26, (3, 17, 21)>
<29, (17, 16, 27)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [9].
