Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes but the other three nodes are not directly connected to each other. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. For each node, find its neighbors:
- Node 0: {9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 1: {7, 3}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 6}
- Node 3: {5, 4, 7, 1, 6, 0}
- Node 4: {7, 8, 0, 3}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 3}
- Node 6: {3, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 1, 3}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 4, 0}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 8, 0}

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 0: <3, (5, 7, 0)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 8: <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 4: <0, (9, 8, 4)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars:
[3] 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
