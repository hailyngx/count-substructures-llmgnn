Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 16) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 15) (5, 10) (5, 11) (13, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 18) (9, 8) (9, 13) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 12) (4, 11) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 15) (6, 12) (6, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 16) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 18) (18, 7) (18, 14) (18, 16) (15, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-star structures. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 3, 17)>
<1, (0, 3, 17)>
<2, (10, 8, 19)>
<3, (1, 0, 17)>
<4, (11, 6, 14)>
<5, (10, 11, 5)>
<6, (12, 14, 16)>
<7, (11, 0, 18)>
<8, (2, 10, 15)>
<9, (8, 13, 19)>
<10, (2, 5, 11)>
<11, (10, 4, 7)>
<12, (15, 6, 19)>
<13, (9, 8, 19)>
<14, (6, 18, 16)>
<15, (2, 12, 8)>
<16, (3, 17, 14)>
<17, (3, 0, 16)>
<18, (7, 14, 16)>
<19, (2, 8, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. 
There are 20 unique 3-stars as listed above, so the total number of 3-stars is [20].
