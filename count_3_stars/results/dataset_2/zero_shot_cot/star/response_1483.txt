Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 25) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 19) (9, 12) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 3) (27, 26) (7, 21) (7, 2) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 18) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 2) (25, 11) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 18) (25, 24) (26, 5) (26, 27) (26, 22) (17, 5) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 4) (29, 21) (29, 17) (22, 27) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 3) (10, 5) (10, 21) (10, 8) (19, 9) (19, 22) (14, 22) (14, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 28) (13, 21) (13, 12) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 1) (28, 23) (8, 10) (8, 6) (15, 6) (23, 28) (23, 6) (2, 7) (2, 20) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 3) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 4) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 24) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 23) (3, 27) (3, 22) (3, 12) (3, 18) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 17) (18, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5: (5, 9, 17)
2. Node 0: (0, 27, 28)
3. Node 21: (21, 7, 29)
4. Node 25: (25, 20, 28)
5. Node 22: (22, 27, 26)
6. Node 10: (10, 5, 21)
7. Node 19: (19, 9, 22)
8. Node 14: (14, 2, 22)
9. Node 1: (1, 0, 7)
10. Node 13: (13, 12, 21)
11. Node 8: (8, 10, 6)
12. Node 4: (4, 0, 24)
13. Node 3: (3, 27, 12)
14. Node 18: (18, 21, 17)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
