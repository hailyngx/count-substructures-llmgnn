Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 12) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 16) (10, 3) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 6) (18, 14) (13, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's find all unique 3-stars and then count them. 

Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <11, (9, 8, 2)>
2. <16, (4, 10, 6)>
3. <6, (9, 3, 18)>
4. <9, (11, 6, 12)>
5. <3, (6, 1, 10)>
6. <4, (16, 8, 0)>
7. <8, (11, 4, 16)>
8. <17, (19, 5, 7)>
9. <7, (17, 15, 14)>
10. <14, (7, 18, 15)>
11. <2, (11, 19, 6)>
12. <19, (3, 17, 2)>
13. <15, (7, 14, 5)>
14. <10, (16, 3, 1)>
15. <5, (17, 15, 12)>
16. <12, (9, 19, 15)>
17. <18, (6, 14, 7)>
18. <13, (1, 7, 13)>
19. <0, (4, 12, 0)>

There are a total of 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
