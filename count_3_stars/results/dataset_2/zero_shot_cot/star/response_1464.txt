Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars.
2. For each potential center node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges to form a 3-star.

Let's follow these steps to find the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 2.
- Node 4 and Node 1 do not have exactly three connections.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 3.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 2.

Checking each potential center node:
- 3-stars centered at Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 7)>
- 3-stars centered at Node 9: <9, (6, 8, 2)>
- 3-stars centered at Node 5: <5, (6, 7, 8)>
- 3-stars centered at Node 2: <2, (9, 1, 3)>
- 3-stars centered at Node 0: <0, (9, 4, 2)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
