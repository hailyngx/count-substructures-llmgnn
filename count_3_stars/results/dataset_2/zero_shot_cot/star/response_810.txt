Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 4) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 12, and 11:
   <5, (9, 2, 12)> - One 3-star here.

2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 11, and 7:
   <9, (5, 6, 11)> - One 3-star here.

3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 12, and 4:
   <6, (9, 14, 12)> - One 3-star here.

4. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 0, and 8:
   <1, (3, 14, 0)> - One 3-star here.

5. Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 10, and 14:
   <13, (9, 2, 10)> - One 3-star here.

6. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 14, and 10:
   <3, (1, 7, 14)> - One 3-star here.

7. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 13, and 12:
   <2, (5, 8, 13)> - One 3-star here.

8. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 13, and 4:
   <0, (1, 13, 4)> - One 3-star here.

9. Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3, 13, and 2:
   <14, (6, 1, 13)> - One 3-star here.

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [9].
