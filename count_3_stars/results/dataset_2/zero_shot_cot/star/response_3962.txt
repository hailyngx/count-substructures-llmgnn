Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 6) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 2) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 19) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 9) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (18, 0) (5, 17) (5, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its neighbors in the given graph. The central node will be the node with exactly three neighbors.

The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 10: 17, 15, 12, 13
- Node 17: 10, 19, 5, 7
- Node 4: 8, 15, 3
- Node 8: 4, 11, 7
- Node 15: 10, 4, 6
- Node 6: 15, 13
- Node 0: 18, 19, 2
- Node 7: 17, 8, 16, 9, 2
- Node 16: 7, 13, 5
- Node 3: 4, 9, 19
- Node 14: 9, 19, 13
- Node 12: 10, 13, 9
- Node 13: 10, 6, 16, 14, 12
- Node 18: 0
- Node 5: 17, 16
- Node 11: 8, 2
- Node 2: 0, 7, 11
- Node 19: 17, 0, 3, 14
- Node 9: 7, 3, 14, 12

From the list above, we can see that only Node 18 has exactly three neighbors: 0, 19, and 2. Therefore, Node 18 is the center of a 3-star.

Next, we need to find the leaves of the 3-star centered at Node 18. The leaves are the nodes that are connected to the center (Node 18). The 3-star centered at Node 18 is <18, (0, 19, 2)>.

Therefore, there is only one 3-star in the given graph.
