Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 6) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 14.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 3.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 11.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 12.
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 2.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 1.
   - Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 7.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 14.
   - Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 3.
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 13.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 14.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 10.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 0, and 1.
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 1.
   
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - <5, (9, 13, 14)>
   - <9, (5, 2, 3)>
   - <4, (7, 13, 11)>
   - <7, (9, 4, 12)>
   - <12, (7, 8, 2)>
   - <2, (9, 12, 1)>
   - <13, (5, 4, 7)>
   - <3, (9, 11, 14)>
   - <11, (4, 12, 3)>
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
