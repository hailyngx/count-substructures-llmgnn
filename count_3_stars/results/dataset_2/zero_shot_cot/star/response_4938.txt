Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 20) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 25) (12, 7) (12, 21) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 4) (29, 28) (29, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 8) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 18) (25, 2) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 20) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 27) (6, 11) (6, 16) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 22) (18, 0) (18, 25) (18, 15) (18, 3) (3, 18) (3, 5) (3, 22) (3, 4) (17, 23) (17, 2) (22, 10) (22, 3) (22, 8) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 27) (20, 19) (8, 0) (8, 10) (8, 22) (8, 15) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 27) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 17) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 21) (4, 28) (4, 11) (4, 25) (4, 3) (4, 19) (19, 29) (19, 20) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 24) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 24) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 20) (27, 16) (21, 12) (21, 15) (21, 19) (24, 19) (24, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern.

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:
1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Determine the neighbors of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star pattern with the central node.

Let's go through the steps now.

[<7, (0, 12, 25)>]
[<4, (3, 11, 25)>]
[<19, (4, 20, 21)>]
[<3, (4, 5, 18)>]
[<18, (0, 15, 25)>]
[<21, (12, 15, 19)>]
[<5, (1, 3, 24)>]
[<1, (2, 16, 27)>]
[<10, (8, 22, 27)>]
[<25, (2, 4, 7)>]
[<24, (5, 19, 0)>]
[<27, (1, 10, 16)>]
[<8, (10, 15, 22)>]
[<12, (7, 21, 15)>]
[<0, (7, 18, 24)>]
[<15, (8, 18, 21)>]
[<2, (1, 17, 25)>]
[<11, (4, 6, 3)>]
[<16, (1, 6, 27)>]
[<22, (3, 8, 10)>]
[<20, (9, 19, 27)>]
[<9, (20, 26, 28)>]
[<26, (9, 10, 23)>]
[<23, (20, 26, 17)>]
[<29, (19, 28, 17)>]
[<17, (23, 2, 29)>]
[<6, (11, 16, 1)>]

Count of 3-stars: [28]
