Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 15) (18, 10) (18, 19) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (3, 17) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 16) (15, 6) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 15) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying all the 3-stars in the graph:
- Central node 0: (0, 1, 7), (0, 4, 11), (0, 7, 13)
- Central node 1: (1, 0, 2)
- Central node 2: (2, 1, 12), (2, 9, 11)
- Central node 4: (4, 11, 19), (4, 14, 17)
- Central node 5: (5, 7, 9), (5, 7, 19), (5, 9, 19)
- Central node 6: (6, 3, 15), (6, 8, 10)
- Central node 7: (7, 0, 5), (7, 13, 9), (7, 13, 14)
- Central node 9: (9, 5, 7), (9, 2, 14), (9, 13, 0)
- Central node 10: (10, 6, 8), (10, 16, 14), (10, 18, 19)
- Central node 11: (11, 0, 4), (11, 2, 9)
- Central node 14: (14, 4, 17), (14, 7, 13), (14, 9, 16)
- Central node 16: (16, 10, 14), (16, 15, 6)
- Central node 17: (17, 4, 14), (17, 3, 6)
- Central node 18: (18, 10, 19)
- Central node 19: (19, 5, 7), (19, 4, 11), (19, 10, 18)

Counting the total unique 3-stars in the graph: 
[21] 

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 13)>, <0, (1, 4, 11)>, <0, (1, 7, 13)>, <1, (0, 2)>, <2, (1, 12)>, <2, (9, 11)>, <4, (11, 19)>, <4, (14, 17)>, <5, (7, 9)>, <5, (7, 19)>, <5, (9, 19)>, <6, (3, 15)>, <6, (8, 10)>, <7, (0, 5)>, <7, (13, 9)>, <7, (13, 14)>, <9, (5, 7)>, <9, (2, 14)>, <9, (13, 0)>, <10, (6, 8)>, <10, (16, 14)>, <10, (18, 19)>, <11, (0, 4)>, <11, (2, 9)>, <14, (4, 17)>, <14, (7, 13)>, <14, (9, 16)>, <16, (10, 14)>, <16, (15, 6)>, <17, (4, 14)>, <17, (3, 6)>, <18, (10, 19)>, <19, (5, 7)>, <19, (4, 11)>, <19, (10, 18)>
