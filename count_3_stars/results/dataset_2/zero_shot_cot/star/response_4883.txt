Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 27) (6, 24) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 28) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (5, 27) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 21) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 4) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 7) (19, 23) (26, 11) (26, 12) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (21, 15) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 25) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 18) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 22) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 16) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 24) (24, 6) (24, 16) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (10, 14) (10, 28) (10, 29) (25, 21) (25, 29) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 18) (23, 29) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 20) (29, 10) (29, 25) (29, 23) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 20) (12, 1) (12, 26) (12, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph.
- Node 4 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 6, 9, 15: <4, (6, 9, 15)>
- Node 2 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 8, 17, 7: <2, (8, 17, 7)>
- Node 28 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 8, 10, 21: <28, (8, 10, 21)>
- Node 13 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 0, 3, 8: <13, (0, 3, 8)>
- Node 15 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 4, 16, 20: <15, (4, 16, 20)>
- Node 19 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 7, 18, 23: <19, (7, 18, 23)>
- Node 23 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 9, 18, 19: <23, (9, 18, 19)>
- Node 11 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 3, 13, 26: <11, (3, 13, 26)>
- Node 12 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 1, 21, 26: <12, (1, 21, 26)>
- Node 0 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 7, 13, 22: <0, (7, 13, 22)>
- Node 10 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 14, 28, 29: <10, (14, 28, 29)>
- Node 25 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 21, 29: <25, (21, 29)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [12]
