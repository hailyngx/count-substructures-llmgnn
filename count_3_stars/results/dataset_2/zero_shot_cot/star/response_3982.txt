Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 17) (9, 2) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 14) (15, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (18, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 6) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 2) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 13) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: (4, 8, 14)
- Node 1: (0, 9, 19)
- Node 2: (3, 9, 11)
- Node 3: (2, 6, 13)
- Node 4: (0, 8, 17)
- Node 5: (12, 17, 5)
- Node 6: (0, 3, 13)
- Node 7: (12, 13, 19)
- Node 8: (0, 4, 14)
- Node 9: (1, 2, 9)
- Node 10: (6, 10, 17)
- Node 11: (2, 11, 14)
- Node 12: (5, 7, 16)
- Node 13: (3, 6, 7)
- Node 14: (0, 8, 11)
- Node 15: (14, 16, 15)
- Node 16: (12, 15, 16)
- Node 17: (4, 10, 17)
- Node 18: (8, 18, 14)
- Node 19: (1, 7, 19)

Now, count the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 8, 14)>
<1, (0, 9, 19)>
<2, (3, 9, 11)>
<3, (2, 6, 13)>
<5, (12, 17, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 13)>
<7, (12, 13, 19)>
<10, (6, 10, 17)>
<11, (2, 11, 14)>
<15, (14, 16, 15)>
<16, (12, 15, 16)>
<18, (8, 18, 14)>
<19, (1, 7, 19)>

Therefore, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
