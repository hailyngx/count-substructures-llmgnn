Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 2. <9, (5, 8, 2)>
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 2, and 1. <4, (7, 2, 1)>
3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 1. <7, (4, 6, 1)>
4. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 8. <1, (4, 0, 8)>
5. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 2. <3, (5, 9, 2)>
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and -.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 1. <8, (9, 7, 1)>
8. Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 3. <0, (9, 1, 3)>
9. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 3. <2, (9, 4, 3)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
