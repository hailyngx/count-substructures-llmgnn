Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 19) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 17) (1, 15) (1, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 8) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 19) (4, 17) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding nodes that are connected in a star pattern.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <3, (17, 10, 2)>
2. <5, (9, 13, 3)>
3. <9, (12, 18, 5)>
4. <11, (10, 16, 18)>
5. <15, (1, 19, 7)>
6. <17, (4, 0, 7)>
7. <18, (9, 11, 8)>
8. <19, (0, 12, 15)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
