Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 4) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 4) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and the leaf nodes for each 3-star configuration. 

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- The central node is 4, and the leaf nodes are 2, 5, and 10. <4, (2, 5, 10)>
- The central node is 14, and the leaf nodes are 1, 6, and 9. <14, (1, 6, 9)>
- The central node is 7, and the leaf nodes are 0, 5, and 13. <7, (0, 5, 13)>
- The central node is 11, and the leaf nodes are 3, 4, and 7. <11, (3, 4, 7)>
- The central node is 9, and the leaf nodes are 0, 7, and 12. <9, (0, 7, 12)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
