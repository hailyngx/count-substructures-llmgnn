Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

- <5, (9, 2, 4)>
- <9, (5, 2, 7)>
- <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <0, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (4, 7, 2)>
- <8, (4, 0, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars. 

There are 8 unique 3-star patterns in the given graph.

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the graph.
