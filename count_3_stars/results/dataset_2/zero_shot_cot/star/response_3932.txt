Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (9, 7, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 0)>
<6, (9, 5, 4)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (7, 1, 0)>
<0, (5, 2, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [10].
