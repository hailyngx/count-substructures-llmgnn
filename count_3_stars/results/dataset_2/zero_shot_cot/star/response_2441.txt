Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5, 9, and 1 respectively:
- Node 5: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 5: (5, 1, 4), (5, 1, 7), (5, 1, 9), (5, 4, 9), (5, 7, 9) [5]
2. For node 9: (9, 1, 4), (9, 1, 7), (9, 1, 5), (9, 4, 7), (9, 4, 5) [4]
3. For node 1: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 6), (1, 3, 9), (1, 4, 6), (1, 4, 9) [3]

Therefore, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
<5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>
