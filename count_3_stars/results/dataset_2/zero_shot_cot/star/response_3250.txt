Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 17) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (18, 19) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (15, 1) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 13) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 3) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 17) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:
<1, (11, 10, 15)>
<4, (9, 10, 6)>
<5, (14, 19, 17)>
<6, (16, 4, 8)>
<9, (14, 4, 13)>
<10, (4, 1, 9)>
<11, (1, 19, 15)>
<13, (1, 2, 9)>
<14, (5, 9, 19)>
<16, (6, 17, 4)>
<17, (16, 5, 7)>
<19, (11, 18, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
