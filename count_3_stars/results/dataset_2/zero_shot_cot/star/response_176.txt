Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 14) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
The first step is to identify which nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes to form 3-stars. Let's list them:

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6: (5, 3, 11), (4, 11, 13)
- Node 4: (6, 10, 5), (8, 10, 7)
- Node 8: (4, 14, 7)
- Node 7: (8, 14, 12), (0, 14, 1)
- Node 12: (11, 7, 14), (3, 11, 14)
- Node 14: (11, 8, 12), (5, 3, 0)

Now, we list the unique 3-stars found:
<6, (5, 3, 11)>
<6, (4, 11, 13)>
<4, (6, 10, 5)>
<4, (8, 10, 7)>
<8, (4, 14, 7)>
<7, (8, 14, 12)>
<7, (0, 14, 1)>
<12, (11, 7, 14)>
<12, (3, 11, 14)>
<14, (11, 8, 12)>
<14, (5, 3, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [11]
