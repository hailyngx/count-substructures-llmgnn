Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 6) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 19) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 15) (1, 5) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (15, 19) (15, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 17) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 14) (16, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations. These will have a central node connected to exactly three other nodes:

1. (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 16) - <5, (1, 3, 16)>
2. (9, 17), (9, 13), (9, 12) - <9, (17, 13, 12)>
3. (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 14) - <4, (7, 12, 14)>
4. (7, 10), (7, 12), (7, 18) - <7, (10, 12, 18)>
5. (10, 11), (10, 1), (10, 19) - <10, (11, 1, 19)>
6. (11, 18), (11, 2), (11, 10) - <11, (18, 2, 10)>
7. (12, 9), (12, 4), (12, 7) - <12, (9, 4, 7)>
8. (18, 7), (18, 11), (18, 19) - <18, (7, 11, 19)>
9. (2, 11), (2, 6), (2, 3) - <2, (11, 6, 3)>
10. (8, 14), (8, 17), (8, 6) - <8, (14, 17, 6)>
11. (19, 10), (19, 18), (19, 15) - <19, (10, 18, 15)>
12. (6, 12), (6, 2), (6, 8) - <6, (12, 2, 8)>
13. (15, 19), (15, 13), (15, 15) - <15, (19, 13, 15)>
14. (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 2) - <3, (5, 4, 2)>
15. (8, 17), (8, 14), (8, 6) - <8, (17, 14, 6)>
16. (14, 4), (14, 8), (14, 13) - <14, (4, 8, 13)>
17. (13, 9), (13, 6), (13, 15) - <13, (9, 6, 15)>
18. (16, 5) - <16, (5, 17, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
