Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a central node and three leaves connected to that central node. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Central node 6:
   - Leaves: 1, 2, 5
   
2. Central node 9:
   - Leaves: 0, 1, 4

3. Central node 4:
   - Leaves: 2, 3, 7

4. Central node 7:
   - Leaves: 1, 3, 8

5. Central node 8:
   - Leaves: 5, 6, 7

6. Central node 5:
   - Leaves: 0, 1, 2

7. Central node 0:
   - Leaves: 3, 5, 9

8. Central node 1:
   - Leaves: 5, 6, 7

9. Central node 3:
   - Leaves: 0, 4, 5

10. Central node 2:
    - Leaves: 4, 5, 6

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
