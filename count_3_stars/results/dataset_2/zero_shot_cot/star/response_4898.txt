Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its neighboring nodes.

Let's analyze the data:

- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 6, 4, 3, 10, 14
- Node 9 has neighbors 5, 4, 2
- Node 4 has neighbors 5, 9, 7, 13
- Node 7 has neighbors 4, 11, 1, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors 7, 12
- Node 3 has neighbors 5, 14, 10, 13
- Node 10 has neighbors 5, 3, 11, 8
- Node 11 has neighbors 7, 10, 0, 13, 12
- Node 6 has neighbors 5, 0
- Node 2 has neighbors 9, 13, 14
- Node 8 has neighbors 7, 10, 14, 0
- Node 14 has neighbors 5, 3, 2, 8, 12, 13
- Node 12 has neighbors 1, 11, 14, 0
- Node 13 has neighbors 4, 3, 11, 2, 14
- Node 0 has neighbors 11, 6, 8, 12

From the list of edges, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<5, (6, 10, 14)>
<4, (7, 13, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 4)>
<1, (12, 7, 11)>
<3, (10, 13, 5)>
<10, (11, 8, 5)>
<11, (13, 12, 7)>
<6, (0, 5, 3)>
<2, (13, 14, 9)>
<8, (0, 14, 10)>
<14, (12, 13, 5)>
<12, (0, 11, 1)>
<13, (2, 14, 4)>
<0, (6, 8, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
