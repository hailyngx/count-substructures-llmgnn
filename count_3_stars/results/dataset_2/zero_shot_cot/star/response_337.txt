Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Upon examining the edges, we find the following 3-stars:
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (0, 2, 6)>

Since the question asks for unique 3-stars only once, we list each one <>, and finally, we count the total number of 3-stars:
