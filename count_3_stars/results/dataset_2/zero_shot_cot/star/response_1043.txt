Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 18) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 25) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 3) (18, 21) (18, 11) (18, 16) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 3) (28, 26) (28, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 10) (27, 17) (27, 6) (25, 0) (25, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 11) (9, 20) (9, 4) (9, 11) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 3) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 23) (16, 18) (16, 22) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (17, 5) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 24) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 22) (24, 8) (24, 13) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 5) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 9) (3, 2) (3, 26) (3, 29) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 23) (23, 1) (23, 19) (23, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars.

Node 0 is connected to nodes 21, 20, and 25, forming one 3-star <0, (21, 20, 25)>.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 28, 9, and 10, forming one 3-star <4, (28, 9, 10)>.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 22, 10, and 17, forming one 3-star <5, (22, 10, 17)>.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 10, and 14, forming one 3-star <7, (12, 10, 14)>.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 25, 19, and 24, forming one 3-star <8, (25, 19, 24)>.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 21, 12, and 24, forming one 3-star <13, (21, 12, 24)>.
Node 15 is connected to nodes 6, 5, and 11, forming one 3-star <15, (6, 5, 11)>.
Node 18 is connected to nodes 21, 11, and 16, forming one 3-star <18, (21, 11, 16)>.
Node 26 is connected to nodes 0, 20, and 29, forming one 3-star <26, (0, 20, 29)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
