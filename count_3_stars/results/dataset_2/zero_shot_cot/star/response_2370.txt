Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 2) (16, 8) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 9) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 14) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 2) (8, 16) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 19) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6)
