Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 9) (27, 19) (3, 25) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 2) (22, 23) (22, 28) (23, 15) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 28) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 26) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 26) (21, 12) (21, 29) (11, 23) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 2) (12, 17) (2, 25) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 28) (1, 10) (1, 8) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 13) (9, 27) (9, 2) (26, 6) (26, 7) (26, 8) (20, 18) (20, 16) (8, 1) (8, 26) (8, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 12) (19, 27) (19, 0) (19, 7) (19, 24) (13, 29) (13, 14) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 18) (16, 10) (28, 22) (28, 23) (28, 2) (18, 20) (18, 16) (18, 24) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 16) (10, 24) (24, 19) (24, 18) (24, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify all the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 3: (25, 6, 5)
- Node 5: (3, 6, 7)
- Node 6: (3, 5, 26)
- Node 7: (5, 0, 26)
- Node 12: (15, 21, 17)
- Node 15: (27, 23, 12)
- Node 16: (25, 20, 18)
- Node 18: (20, 16, 24)
- Node 19: (27, 0, 24)
- Node 23: (22, 28, 11)
- Node 24: (19, 18, 10)
- Node 26: (6, 7, 8)
- Node 27: (15, 9, 19)
- Node 28: (22, 23, 2)
- Node 29: (6, 21, 13)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<3, (25, 6, 5)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (3, 5, 26)>
<7, (5, 0, 26)>
<12, (15, 21, 17)>
<15, (27, 23, 12)>
<16, (25, 20, 18)>
<18, (20, 16, 24)>
<19, (27, 0, 24)>
<23, (22, 28, 11)>
<24, (19, 18, 10)>
<26, (6, 7, 8)>
<27, (15, 9, 19)>
<28, (22, 23, 2)>
<29, (6, 21, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
