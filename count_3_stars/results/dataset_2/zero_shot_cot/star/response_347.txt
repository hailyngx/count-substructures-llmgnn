Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Potential central nodes for 3-stars can be: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- \(<0, (8, 13, 6)>\)
- \(<1, (5, 9, 14)>\)
- \(<2, (5, 13, 12)>\)
- \(<3, (7, 6, 14)>\)
- \(<4, (13, 6, 8)>\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
