Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 10) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, letâ€™s list all nodes along with their degrees for reference:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 6
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 5
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (4, 7, 11)>
<2, (9, 12, 14)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.
