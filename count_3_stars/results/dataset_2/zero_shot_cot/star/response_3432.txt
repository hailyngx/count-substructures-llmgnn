Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 25) (16, 8) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 3) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 20) (27, 3) (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 4) (29, 24) (29, 10) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 23) (1, 4) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (22, 6) (23, 1) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 26) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 5) (12, 14) (26, 11) (26, 21) (26, 20) (9, 11) (9, 25) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 20) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 25) (25, 16) (25, 27) (25, 9) (25, 19) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 24) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 26) (20, 5) (0, 28) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 1) (4, 19) (24, 29) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 18) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 17) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 22) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes directly connected to each node in order to identify the 3-stars.
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 28 and 6
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 20, 23, and 4
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 29, 17, and 4
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 15, 27, 1, 13, and 5
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 11, 2, 29, 1, and 19
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 3, 8, 28, 19, and 20
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 22 and 0
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 21
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 16, 13, 5
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 11 and 25
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 16, 29, 24, and 18
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 14, 9, 26, and 4
- Node 12: Connected to node 14
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 3, 8, and 18
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 11, 12, and 24
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 3 and 27
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 25, 8, and 10
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 2 and 18
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 13, 10, and 17
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 5, 4, and 25
- Node 20: Connected to nodes 27, 1, 26, and 5
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 7 and 26
- Node 22: Connected to node 6
- Node 23: Connected to node 1
- Node 24: Connected to nodes 29, 28, 14, and 10
- Node 25: Connected to nodes 16, 27, 9, and 19
- Node 26: Connected to nodes 11, 21, 20
- Node 27: Connected to nodes 15, 25, 20, and 3
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 0, 24, and 5
- Node 29: Connected to nodes 2, 4, 24, and 10

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<11, (4, 9, 26)>
<16, (8, 10, 25)>
<15, (3, 20, 27)>
<2, (4, 17, 29)>
<1, (4, 20, 23)>
<3, (5, 13, 15)>
<27, (20, 25, 3)>
<29, (10, 24, 4)>
<0, (6, 28, 0)>
<8, (13, 5, 16)>
<5, (19, 20, 28)>
<18, (10, 13, 17)>

Total number of 3-stars: [12]
