Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 4) (4, 0) (4, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (8, 1, 11)>
<9, (6, 10, 0)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (8, 5, 10)>
<3, (8, 7, 12)>
<4, (0, 14, 11)>
<13, (7, 10, 11)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we have a total of [7].
