Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 6 since those will form 3-stars with 6 as the center. 
Nodes connected to 6: {5, 14, 10, 4}

Next, let's check for each of these nodes how many common neighbors they have with node 6. These common neighbors will form 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- For node 5: 8, 12, 7, 0
- For node 14: 9, 13, 2, 12
- For node 10: 13, 3, 1
- For node 4: 13, 0

So, the 3-stars centered at node 6 are <6, (5, 8, 12, 7)>, <6, (14, 9, 13, 2)>, <6, (10, 13, 3, 1)>, <6, (4, 13, 0)>.

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <<6, (5, 8, 12, 7)>, <6, (14, 9, 13, 2)>, <6, (10, 13, 3, 1)>, <6, (4, 13, 0)>]
