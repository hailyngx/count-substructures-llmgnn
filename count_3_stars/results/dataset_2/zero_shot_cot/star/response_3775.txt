Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and the leaf nodes connected to each central node:

1. Central node 1: connected to nodes 6, 2, 5.
2. Central node 3: connected to nodes 14, 6, 5.
3. Central node 8: connected to nodes 13, 5, 6.
4. Central node 13: connected to nodes 8, 4, 9.
5. Central node 7: connected to nodes 1, 13, 5.
6. Central node 12: connected to nodes 8, 2, 5.
7. Central node 0: connected to nodes 12, 10, 11.
8. Central node 14: connected to nodes 3, 9, 10.
9. Central node 2: connected to nodes 1, 12, 6.
10. Central node 11: connected to nodes 0.
11. Central node 6: connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 2, 4.
12. Central node 10: connected to nodes 1, 0, 14, 2, 4.
13. Central node 5: connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 7, 12.
14. Central node 4: connected to nodes 13, 0, 6, 10, 9.
15. Central node 9: connected to nodes 13, 0, 14, 4.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars by noting that a central node is involved in each 3-star:

- Central node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 3 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 8 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 13 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 12 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 14 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Central node 6 can form 5 3-stars.
- Central node 10 can form 5 3-stars.
- Central node 5 can form 5 3-stars.
- Central node 4 can form 5 3-stars.
- Central node 9 can form 5 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is: [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5] = [33].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (6, 2, 5)>
<3, (14, 6, 5)>
<8, (13, 5, 6)>
<13, (8, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 13, 5)>
<12, (8, 2, 5)>
<0, (12, 10, 11)>
<14, (3, 9, 10)>
<2, (1, 12, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<10, (1, 14, 4)>
<5, (1, 8, 12)>
<4, (13, 0, 10)>
<9, (13, 14, 4)>
