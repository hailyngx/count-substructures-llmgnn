Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 24) (0, 1) (0, 23) (27, 25) (27, 11) (22, 23) (22, 14) (23, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 13) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 1) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 12) (14, 22) (14, 26) (4, 10) (4, 3) (16, 8) (16, 24) (16, 20) (16, 5) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 15) (26, 2) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 15) (13, 23) (13, 2) (13, 17) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 21) (17, 7) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 19) (21, 17) (21, 11) (25, 27) (25, 29) (12, 18) (12, 28) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 26) (5, 11) (6, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 10) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 1) (29, 11) (15, 28) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 7) (19, 3) (19, 7) (9, 28) (9, 3) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 19) (20, 16) (10, 4) (10, 1) (11, 27) (11, 21) (11, 5) (11, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<0, (1, 23, 24)>
<8, (1, 16, 23)>
<2, (13, 17, 26)>
<13, (2, 17, 23)>
<17, (7, 15, 21)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (8, 16, 26)>
<9, (3, 28, 29)>
<29, (1, 11, 25)>
<11, (5, 21, 27)>
<26, (5, 15, 18)>
<15, (7, 17, 28)>
<21, (11, 17, 27)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
