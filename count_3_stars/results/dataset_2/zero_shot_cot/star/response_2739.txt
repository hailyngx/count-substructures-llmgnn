Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 21) (23, 5) (23, 17) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 27) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 0) (16, 14) (28, 9) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 21) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 0) (21, 19) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 4) (24, 18) (24, 17) (24, 15) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (29, 27) (29, 19) (5, 23) (5, 2) (5, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (20, 18) (27, 22) (27, 29) (27, 17) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 1) (12, 0) (12, 25) (12, 9) (19, 21) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 24) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 12) (25, 26) (25, 12) (25, 19) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
We need to find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Let's first identify the center nodes and their neighbors:

1. Center node 0 (connected to 21, 19, 13, and 12)
2. Center node 2 (connected to 5, 6, and 4)
3. Center node 4 (connected to 3, 2, 6, and 17)
4. Center node 5 (connected to 23, 2, and 15)
5. Center node 6 (connected to 7, 2, 15, and 4)
6. Center node 9 (connected to 28, 7, 12, and 25)
7. Center node 10 (connected to 11, 21, 26, and 13)
8. Center node 11 (connected to 10, 7, 26, and 21)
9. Center node 14 (connected to 22, 16, and 1)
10. Center node 16 (connected to 0, 14, and 16)
11. Center node 18 (connected to 26, 20, 24, and 21)
12. Center node 19 (connected to 21, 0, 29, and 25)
13. Center node 21 (connected to 10, 11, 18, 0, and 19)
14. Center node 22 (connected to 26, 14, and 27)
15. Center node 24 (connected to 18, 17, and 15)
16. Center node 25 (connected to 26, 12, and 19)
17. Center node 26 (connected to 10, 11, 22, 18, and 25)
18. Center node 27 (connected to 22, 29, and 17)
19. Center node 29 (connected to 27, 19, and 25)

Now, let's form the 3-stars:

1. <0, (21, 19, 13)> 
2. <0, (21, 19, 12)>
3. <0, (21, 13, 12)>
4. <0, (19, 13, 12)>
5. <2, (5, 6, 4)>
6. <6, (7, 15, 4)>
7. <10, (11, 26, 13)>
8. <11, (10, 26, 21)>
9. <14, (22, 16, 1)>
10. <16, (0, 14, 16)>
11. <18, (26, 20, 24)>
12. <19, (21, 0, 29)>
13. <22, (26, 14, 27)>
14. <24, (18, 17, 15)>
15. <25, (26, 12, 19)>
16. <27, (22, 29, 17)>
17. <29, (27, 19, 25)>

Therefore, there are [17] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
