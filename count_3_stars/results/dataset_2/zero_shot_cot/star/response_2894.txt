Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (7, 1) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
There are total 10 unique 3-stars found in the graph.
