Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:

<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<4, (9, 8, 6)>
<7, (5, 0, 6)>
<8, (9, 4, 6)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (9, 2, -)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>
<2, (5, 0, 6)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
