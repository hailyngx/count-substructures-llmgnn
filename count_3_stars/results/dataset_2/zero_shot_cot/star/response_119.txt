Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges connected to them: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 1, 5)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 6)>
<4, (5, 1, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
