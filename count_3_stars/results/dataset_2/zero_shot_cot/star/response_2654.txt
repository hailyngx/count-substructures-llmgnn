Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 21) (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 11) (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 21) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 10) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 6) (7, 6) (12, 14) (12, 23) (12, 16) (12, 1) (4, 27) (4, 19) (18, 5) (18, 8) (13, 26) (13, 21) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 11) (26, 8) (1, 15) (1, 12) (1, 29) (3, 21) (3, 16) (21, 15) (21, 17) (21, 13) (21, 3) (21, 24) (6, 23) (6, 0) (6, 7) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 3) (29, 22) (29, 0) (29, 1) (5, 23) (5, 18) (5, 11) (28, 0) (8, 20) (8, 22) (8, 18) (8, 26) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 11) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 9) (24, 21) (9, 17) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 11) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (10, 20) (10, 25) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star configuration.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (20, 28, 29)>
<1, (15, 12, 29)>
<2, (15, 26, 19)>
<3, (21, 16, 24)>
<4, (27, 19, 5)>
<5, (23, 18, 11)>
<6, (23, 0, 7)>
<8, (20, 22, 18)>
<9, (17, 25, 19)>
<10, (20, 25, 10)>
<11, (27, 26, 5)>
<12, (14, 17, 16)>
<13, (26, 21, 13)>
<14, (17, 12, 16)>
<15, (1, 21, 2)>
<16, (17, 12, 3)>
<17, (14, 25, 21)>
<18, (8, 22, 5)>
<19, (4, 2, 9)>
<20, (0, 8, 10)>
<21, (15, 17, 13)>
<22, (23, 29, 8)>
<23, (22, 5, 6)>
<24, (21, 16, 0)>
<25, (10, 17, 9)>
<26, (13, 2, 8)>
<27, (4, 11, 19)>
<28, (0, 29, 20)>
<29, (22, 1, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: [30]
