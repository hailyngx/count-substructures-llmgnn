Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form a 3-star configuration.

Starting from the center node, we look for nodes that are directly connected to the center. If a node is connected to the center and has exactly two other connections (forming a triangle shape with the center node), then we have identified a 3-star.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (5, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 0)>
<7, (9, 1, 6)>
<0, (9, 6, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
