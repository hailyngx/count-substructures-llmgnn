Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 14) (27, 9) (14, 27) (14, 17) (14, 26) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (21, 5) (21, 22) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (11, 19) (11, 4) (24, 10) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 3) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 23) (16, 10) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 12) (28, 20) (2, 7) (2, 0) (22, 21) (22, 3) (22, 6) (22, 1) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 18) (9, 27) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 4) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 12) (8, 7) (8, 10) (1, 28) (1, 22) (1, 25) (20, 3) (20, 28) (4, 11) (4, 9) (25, 1) (25, 6) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 12) (12, 17) (12, 28) (12, 5) (12, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 24) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 6) (29, 16) (29, 18) (29, 0) (13, 18) (13, 23) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 29) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Here they are:
<7, (9, 2, 8)>
<16, (28, 29, 23)>
<12, (17, 28, 23)>
<22, (3, 6, 1)>
<18, (19, 29, 13)>
<10, (24, 16, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
