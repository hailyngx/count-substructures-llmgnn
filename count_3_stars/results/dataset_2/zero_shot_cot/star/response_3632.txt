Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 11) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (5, 4) (5, 12) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 19) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 0) (14, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (17, 19, 4)>
<9, (18, 16, 7)>
<8, (13, 2, 16)>
<13, (8, 19, 7)>
<10, (17, 18, 1)>
<4, (6, 18, 5)>
<18, (9, 10, 4)>
<2, (8, 12, 0)>
<5, (4, 12, 0)>
<7, (9, 13, 0)>
<12, (17, 2, 5)>
<3, (12, 19, 0)>
<15, (19, 16, 0)>
<1, (10, 16, 0)>
<11, (8, 17, 0)>
<14, (19, 0, 0)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[16]
