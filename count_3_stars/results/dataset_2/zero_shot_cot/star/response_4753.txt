Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 10) (13, 1) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 4) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 20) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 28) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 29) (26, 27) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 29) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 10) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 24) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 25) (12, 23) (24, 18) (24, 17) (24, 14) (17, 3) (17, 24) (17, 5) (29, 26) (29, 11) (25, 9) (25, 4) (1, 13) (1, 11) (20, 21) (20, 5) (20, 16) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 28) (5, 17) (5, 20) (16, 20) (16, 14) (14, 9) (14, 24) (14, 16) (14, 27) (27, 26) (27, 14) (27, 23) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 27) (0, 9) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars must have exactly three edges connected to them. We can observe all possible 3-stars in the graph by looking at nodes with three edges:

1. Node 13: (13, 21), (13, 10), (13, 1) - <13, (21, 10, 1)>
2. Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 2), (3, 17) - <3, (15, 2, 17)>
3. Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 26), (15, 2) - <15, (3, 26, 2)>
4. Node 6: (6, 15), (6, 9), (6, 10) - <6, (15, 9, 10)>
5. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 25), (9, 4) - <9, (6, 25, 4)>
6. Node 21: (21, 13), (21, 7), (21, 20) - <21, (13, 7, 20)>
7. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 15), (2, 8) - <2, (3, 15, 8)>
8. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 19), (8, 10) - <8, (2, 19, 10)>
9. Node 19: (19, 2), (19, 8), (19, 28) - <19, (2, 8, 28)>
10. Node 26: (26, 15), (26, 18), (26, 29) - <26, (15, 18, 29)>
11. Node 28: (28, 3), (28, 19), (28, 11) - <28, (3, 19, 11)>
12. Node 18: (18, 26), (18, 28), (18, 24) - <18, (26, 28, 24)>
13. Node 4: (4, 15), (4, 9), (4, 25) - <4, (15, 9, 25)>
14. Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 24), (14, 16) - <14, (9, 24, 16)>
15. Node 27: (27, 26), (27, 14), (27, 23) - <27, (26, 14, 23)>
16. Node 23: (23, 6), (23, 7), (23, 12) - <23, (6, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is the number of unique combinations listed above, which is [(16)].
