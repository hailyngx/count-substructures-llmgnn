Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 14) (0, 6) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 9) (16, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 15) (13, 19) (13, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three connections:
- Node 14 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 3, 10, 17)
- Node 17 is connected to 5 nodes (8, 11, 14, 15, 19)
- Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes (1, 6, 8, 18)
- Node 6 is connected to 2 nodes (0, 5)
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes (6, 14, 17)
- Node 19 is connected to 4 nodes (8, 13, 17, 9)
- Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes (5, 17, 19)
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes (3, 4, 12, 19)
- Node 12 is connected to 3 nodes (9, 11, 18)
- Node 11 is connected to 4 nodes (2, 7, 12, 17)
- Node 18 is connected to 4 nodes (1, 5, 12, 15)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

<14, (0, 10, 17)>
<17, (8, 11, 19)>
<5, (1, 8, 18)>
<0, (6, 14, 17)>
<19, (8, 13, 17)>
<9, (3, 4, 12)>
<12, (11, 18, 9)>
<11, (2, 12, 17)>
<18, (1, 12, 15)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the answer is [9].
