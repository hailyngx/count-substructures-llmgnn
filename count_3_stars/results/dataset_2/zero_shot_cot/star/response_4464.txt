Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (12, 0) (9, 18) (9, 14) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (13, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-star configurations in this graph:
<0, (11, 6, 12)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 14)>
<3, (1, 15, 18)>
<4, (0, 2, 10)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (11, 16, 17)>
<7, (1, 5, 10)>
<8, (0, 5, 17)>
<9, (14, 18, 9)>
<13, (15, 14, 13)>
<16, (3, 11, 6)>
<15, (3, 13, 4)>
<17, (6, 8, 5)>
<18, (3, 9, 19)>
<19, (18, 9, 0)>
<10, (4, 7, 15)>
<12, (0, 8, 2)>
<11, (16, 6, 0)>
<14, (1, 9, 5)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [20].
