Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. <4, (7, 8, 2)>
2. <7, (4, 3, 9)>
3. <8, (4, 7, 5)>
4. <5, (8, 1, _)>
5. <0, (6, 9, 8)>
6. <6, (1, 0, _)>
7. <9, (7, 2, 0)>
8. <2, (4, 7, 9)>
9. <1, (6, 8, 5)>
10. <3, (4, 7, 0)>

So, there are 10 unique 3-star subgraphs. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
