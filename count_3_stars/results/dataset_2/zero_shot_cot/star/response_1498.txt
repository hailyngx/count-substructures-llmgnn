Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 4 since a 3-star must involve the node 4 as the center. Nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9 are connected to node 4.

Next, let's examine each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars. 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 6. This forms a 3-star <2, (4, 3, 6)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 8. This forms a 3-star <7, (4, 1, 8)>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9. This forms a 3-star <8, (4, 7, 9)>.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 8. This forms a 3-star <9, (4, 1, 8)>.

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is [4].
