Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (15, 22) (15, 24) (15, 4) (27, 18) (27, 9) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 26) (9, 27) (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 17) (26, 7) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 8) (0, 20) (0, 5) (0, 1) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 19) (20, 23) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 20) (17, 13) (3, 23) (21, 4) (21, 22) (13, 16) (13, 17) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 0) (5, 12) (6, 14) (6, 24) (6, 23) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 23) (2, 7) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 24) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 29) (29, 11) (29, 10) (29, 25) (8, 26) (8, 10) (22, 15) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 25) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 10) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 22) (18, 27) (18, 7) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 20) (19, 28) (23, 20) (23, 3) (23, 6) (23, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can start by listing out the 3-stars present in the graph.

<0, (1, 5, 20)>
<1, (0, 10, 16)>
<2, (7, 22, 26)>
<3, (6, 23, 24)>
<4, (15, 21, 24)>
<5, (0, 11, 26)>
<6, (14, 23, 24)>
<7, (2, 18, 26)>
<8, (10, 26, 28)>
<9, (17, 27, 28)>
<10, (1, 8, 29)>
<11, (5, 16, 29)>
<12, (5, 16, 24)>
<13, (16, 17, 29)>
<14, (6, 10, 14)>
<15, (4, 22, 24)>
<16, (1, 11, 13)>
<17, (9, 11, 20)>
<18, (2, 27, 7)>
<19, (20, 23, 28)>
<20, (0, 17, 19)>
<21, (4, 22, 24)>
<22, (2, 21, 25)>
<23, (3, 6, 24)>
<24, (3, 6, 12)>
<25, (22, 25, 29)>
<26, (2, 5, 8)>
<27, (9, 18, 28)>
<28, (8, 19, 27)>
<29, (10, 11, 25)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:

[29]
