Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph and count them.

The nodes with their respective connections are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 7, 3
- Node 1: 4, 8, 13, 14, 2, 10
- Node 2: 9, 13, 1
- Node 3: 5, 11, 0, 12
- Node 4: 0, 10, 1
- Node 5: 3, 14
- Node 6: 9, 11, 12, 8, 13
- Node 7: 0, 10, 9
- Node 8: 6, 13, 14, 11, 12, 1
- Node 9: 7, 6, 2
- Node 10: 4, 7, 1
- Node 11: 6, 8, 3, 14
- Node 12: 6, 8, 13, 3
- Node 13: 6, 8, 12, 2, 1, 0
- Node 14: 8, 5, 11, 1

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 0.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 5.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 7.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 9.
- There are no 3-stars centered at Node 10.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 13)>
<2, (1, 9, 13)>
<3, (0, 11, 12)>
<4, (0, 1, 10)>
<6, (8, 9, 12)>
<8, (1, 6, 14)>
<11, (3, 6, 14)>
<12, (3, 6, 8)>
<13, (0, 1, 6)>
<14, (1, 8, 11)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
