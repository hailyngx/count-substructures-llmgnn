Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them since those could be potential centers of 3-star graphs. The nodes are 0, 2, 7. 
- For node 0: (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 8)
- For node 2: (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 0)
- For node 7: (7, 4), (7, 1)

We see that nodes 0 and 2 can be center nodes. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars now.
- For node 0: There are 4 possibilities for leaves connected to node 0.
- For node 2: There are 4 possibilities for leaves connected to node 2.

So total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <<0, (4, 3, 8)>, <0, (4, 2, 8)>, <2, (9, 1, 0)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)> >
