Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 29) (22, 18) (12, 18) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 23) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 4) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 25) (26, 4) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 25) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 25) (3, 0) (3, 24) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 14) (4, 29) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 25) (10, 19) (10, 2) (10, 14) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 6) (8, 7) (28, 19) (28, 8) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 14) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 14) (14, 21) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (23, 18) (23, 27) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 2) (24, 3) (24, 5) (24, 9) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 4) (25, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 23) (16, 14) (16, 13) (13, 27) (13, 16) (9, 24) (7, 17) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 18, as these could potentially form 3-stars with 18 as the central node:
- Nodes connected to node 18: 22, 23, 12, 29

Now, let's check each of these potential 3-stars:
1. Node 18: (22, 23, 12) - Not a 3-star since node 22 is missing an edge to node 12.
2. Node 18: (22, 23, 29) - Not a 3-star since node 29 is missing an edge to either node 22 or 23.
3. Node 18: (22, 12, 29) - Not a 3-star since node 22 is missing an edge to node 29.
4. Node 18: (23, 12, 29) - This is a valid 3-star.
  
Next, let's search for more potential 3-stars:
- Nodes connected to node 27: 12, 1, 13, 23
- Nodes connected to node 0: 20, 3, 21, 17
- Nodes connected to node 17: 0, 15, 7
- Nodes connected to node 29: 18, 4
- Nodes connected to node 19: 26, 2, 28, 10
- Nodes connected to node 26: 19, 25, 4
- Nodes connected to node 1: 27, 15, 25

After checking all potential 3-stars, we find that the only 3-star in the given graph is <18, (23, 12, 29)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1], as only one unique 3-star was identified.
