Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down all possible 3-stars:

<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<4, (8, 1, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<5, (2, 1, 0)>
<2, (6, 5, 0)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 0)>
<3, (6, 9, 0)>
<1, (4, 8, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
