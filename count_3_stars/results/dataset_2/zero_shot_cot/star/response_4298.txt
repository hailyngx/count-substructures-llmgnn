Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 3) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (8, 5) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (0, 19) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 5) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 19) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 12) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (19, 1, 16)>
<1, (19, 18, 5)>
<2, (5, 13, 12)>
<3, (4, 10, 16)>
<4, (6, 8, 3)>
<5, (1, 5, 15)>
<7, (17, 9, 6)>
<11, (14, 9, 15)>
