Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 14) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 28) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 7) (1, 13) (1, 27) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 4) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 12) (28, 3) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 8) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 18) (2, 27) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 18) (13, 16) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 21) (9, 7) (9, 22) (22, 9) (22, 15) (22, 17) (10, 26) (10, 6) (15, 22) (15, 5) (15, 21) (29, 21) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 11) (14, 27) (8, 28) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 15) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 17) (16, 18) (16, 13) (17, 22) (17, 24) (17, 5) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 15) (21, 29) (21, 23) (19, 0) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 14) (4, 26) (4, 24) (4, 5) (23, 3) (23, 21) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

There are a total of 30 nodes, and the graph has 90 edges. 

To find all the 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges. Let's identify them:

- Node 3 has edges to 5 other nodes (25, 11, 28, 14, 23).
- Node 6 has edges to 5 other nodes (28, 24, 10, 12, 6).
- Node 18 has edges to 4 other nodes (2, 14, 16, 13).
- Node 13 has edges to 4 other nodes (1, 26, 18, 16).
- Node 11 has edges to 4 other nodes (3, 12, 14, 21).
- Node 22 has edges to 4 other nodes (9, 15, 17, 22).
- Node 21 has edges to 5 other nodes (0, 11, 15, 29, 23).
- Node 14 has edges to 5 other nodes (3, 2, 18, 11, 27).
- Node 5 has edges to 4 other nodes (15, 8, 4, 17).
- Node 28 has edges to 4 other nodes (3, 25, 6, 8).
- Node 17 has edges to 4 other nodes (22, 24, 5, 17).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<3, (25, 11, 28)>
<6, (28, 24, 10)>
<18, (2, 14, 16)>
<13, (1, 26, 18)>
<11, (12, 14, 21)>
<22, (9, 15, 17)>
<21, (0, 15, 29)>
<14, (2, 18, 27)>
<5, (15, 8, 17)>
<28, (25, 6, 8)>
<17, (22, 24, 5)>

Counting each unique 3-star, we find that there are [11] 3-stars in the graph.
