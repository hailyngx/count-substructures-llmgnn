Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 23) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 14) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 16) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 14) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 2) (27, 16) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 22) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 24) (14, 26) (14, 15) (14, 23) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 18) (10, 6) (10, 29) (10, 5) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 12) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 11) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 22) (4, 2) (22, 21) (22, 25) (22, 4) (22, 5) (11, 25) (11, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 2) (29, 10) (29, 18) (20, 1) (20, 21) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 23) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 24) (19, 1) (2, 9) (2, 27) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (13, 9) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 24) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 29) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<2, (7, 9, 13)>
<9, (2, 7, 13)>
<15, (0, 14, 23)>
<21, (1, 20, 22)>
<25, (11, 17, 22)>
