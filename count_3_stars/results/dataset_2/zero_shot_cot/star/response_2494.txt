Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 13) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's go through the nodes and check for each if it forms a 3-star with any three adjacent nodes. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (7, 9, 13)>
<4, (2, 10, 12)>
<5, (6, 8, 14)>
<6, (5, 7, 10)>
<7, (6, 10, 12)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
<10, (4, 6, 7)>
<11, (0, 12, 13)>
<12, (0, 7, 11)>
<13, (1, 3, 11)>
<14, (0, 5, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 12 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
