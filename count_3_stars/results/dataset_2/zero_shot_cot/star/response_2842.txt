Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 6) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 0) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which forms a 3-star pattern.

From the given edges, we can see the nodes that fit this criteria: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 16.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 14.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 15.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 13, and 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 11.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 6, 18, and 19.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 17.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 15, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 6, 15, and 18.

Next, we count the number of unique 3-stars formed by these nodes. 

[The number of 3-stars is 12]

<0, (4, 7, 16)>
<2, (9, 12, 14)>
<4, (0, 8, 13)>
<6, (3, 11, 15)>
<8, (4, 13, 14)>
<11, (5, 6, 12)>
<12, (1, 2, 11)>
<14, (1, 2, 8)>
<15, (6, 18, 19)>
<16, (0, 3, 17)>
<18, (1, 15, 19)>
<19, (6, 15, 18)>
