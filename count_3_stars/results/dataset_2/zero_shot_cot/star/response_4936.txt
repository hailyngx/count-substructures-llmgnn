Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph [<0, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>].
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
