Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (1, 4) (1, 13) (9, 13) (9, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify each 3-star pattern.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 4 has neighbors 7, 13, 1, and 6. Since they form a 3-star, we have <4, (7, 13, 1)>.
2. Node 7 has neighbors 4, 3, 10, 13, and 5. We already counted the 3-star with node 4 as the center, so we don't count it again. Thus, we have <7, (3, 10, 5)>.
3. Node 6 has neighbors 4, 8, 12, and 0. We already counted the 3-star with node 4 as the center, so we don't count it again. Thus, we have <6, (8, 12, 0)>.
4. Node 3 has neighbors 7, 5, 11, and 14. We already counted the 3-star with node 7 as the center, so we don't count it again. Thus, we have <3, (5, 11, 14)>.
5. Node 11 has neighbors 3, 14, 0, and 9. Since they form a 3-star, we have <11, (14, 0, 9)>.
6. Node 2 has neighbors 5, 12, 14, and 0. Since they form a 3-star, we have <2, (12, 14, 0)>.
7. Node 12 has neighbors 8, 13, 6, 2, and 10. We already counted the 3-star with node 6 as the center, so we don't count it again. Thus, we have <12, (8, 13, 2)>.
8. Node 14 has neighbors 3, 11, 2, and 12. We already counted the 3-star with node 11 as the center, so we don't count it again. Thus, we have <14, (2, 12, 0)>.

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars found: [7].
