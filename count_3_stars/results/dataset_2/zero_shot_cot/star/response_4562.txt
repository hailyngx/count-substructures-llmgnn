Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be potential central nodes of 3-stars since they have exactly three neighbors. 

Nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 4
- Node 7
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 8
- Node 2
- Node 6

Next, for each potential central node, check if it forms a 3-star structure with exactly three leaves. This means that the central node is connected to three other nodes, and those three nodes are not directly connected to each other.

3-stars:
<5, (8, 4, 7)>
<9, (8, 2, 1)>
<4, (5, 1, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<8, (9, 5, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (7, 1, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars gives us a total of 9. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
