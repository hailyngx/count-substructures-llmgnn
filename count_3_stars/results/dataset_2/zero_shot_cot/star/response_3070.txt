Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars in the given graph by looking at nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:

Nodes with 3 edges: 1, 5, 8
Nodes with more than 3 edges: 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Nodes with 2 edges: 0, 2, 3

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 13)>
- <8, (1, 2, 12)>   

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
