Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Starting with node 0:
- (0, 4, 1)
- (0, 4, 5)
- (0, 4, 2)

Moving on to node 1:
- (1, 14, 7)
- (1, 7, 0)
- (1, 7, 18)

Examining node 2:
- (2, 19, 4)

Considering node 3:
- (3, 18, 13)
- (3, 18, 5)

Looking at node 4:
- (4, 10, 0)
- (4, 10, 19)
- (4, 0, 7)
- (4, 0, 5)
- (4, 2, 19)
- (4, 1, 7)
- (4, 12, 17)

Examining node 5:
- (5, 0, 8)
- (5, 0, 3)
- (5, 8, 6)

Considering node 6:
- (6, 17, 12)
- (6, 8, 18)

Looking at node 7:
- (7, 0, 1)
- (7, 18, 13)

Considering node 8:
- (8, 17, 11)
