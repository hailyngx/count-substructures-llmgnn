Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 15) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 10) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 5) (3, 28) (3, 23) (25, 26) (25, 22) (25, 14) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 15) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 15) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (15, 21) (15, 7) (15, 29) (15, 0) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (8, 20) (8, 27) (22, 25) (22, 26) (22, 28) (22, 12) (26, 25) (26, 22) (6, 28) (6, 24) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 18) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 27) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 23) (24, 4) (24, 6) (24, 12) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 27) (9, 27) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 29) (19, 18) (16, 0) (16, 14) (11, 14) (11, 18) (10, 4) (18, 28) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 12) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 18) (23, 3) (23, 2) (23, 13) (27, 8) (27, 5) (27, 17) (27, 9) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (20, 15, 16)>
<1, (21, 17, 19)>
<2, (29, 17, 23)>
<3, (28, 23, 3)>
<4, (7, 21, 10)>
<4, (7, 21, 24)>
<5, (13, 5, 27)>
<6, (28, 24, 6)>
<7, (15, 21, 7)>
<8, (20, 8, 27)>
<11, (14, 11, 18)>
<12, (22, 12, 18)>
<13, (23, 13, 5)>
<14, (25, 14, 11)>
<15, (0, 15, 21)>
<15, (0, 15, 29)>
<17, (1, 17, 27)>
<18, (19, 18, 28)>
<18, (11, 18, 12)>
<19, (1, 19, 29)>
<19, (21, 19, 18)>
<20, (0, 20, 28)>
<22, (25, 22, 26)>
<22, (12, 22, 24)>
<23, (2, 23, 13)>
<24, (4, 24, 12)>
<25, (14, 25, 26)>
<26, (22, 26, 25)>
<27, (8, 27, 17)>
<28, (3, 28, 18)>
<28, (20, 28, 22)>
<29, (2, 29, 19)>
<29, (15, 29, 21)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
