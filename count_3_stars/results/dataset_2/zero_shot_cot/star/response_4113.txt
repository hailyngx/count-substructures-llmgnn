Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (9, 10) (9, 16) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (19, 18) (19, 12) (12, 16) (12, 19) (0, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 14) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are directly connected to at least three other nodes. These nodes have the potential to be a center of a 3-star.

Nodes with at least three connections: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16

Next, we will check all possible combinations for each potential center node to see if they form a 3-star. 

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (2, 3, 7)> 
- <2, (1, 13, 16)>
- <3, (1, 0, 13)>
- <5, (6, 8, 11)>
- <7, (1, 8, 13)>
- <10, (9, 14, 17)>
- <13, (1, 2, 7)>
- <16, (9, 18, 12)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [7]
