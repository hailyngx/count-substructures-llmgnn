Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (14, 3) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (17, 14) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 1) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 6) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 14) (18, 0) (16, 19) (16, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 11) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, let's count the number of 3-stars.

We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- Central node 3: (3, 6), (3, 14), (6, 15)
- Central node 4: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 12)
- Central node 5: (5, 10), (5, 11), (5, 10)
- Central node 7: (7, 2), (7, 9), (7, 10)
- Central node 10: (10, 5), (10, 7), (10, 15)
- Central node 11: (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 1)
- Central node 12: (12, 6), (12, 15), (12, 4)
- Central node 14: (14, 3), (14, 17), (14, 0)
- Central node 15: (15, 6), (15, 12), (15, 10)
- Central node 18: (18, 0), (18, 14), (18, 0)
- Central node 19: (19, 2), (19, 16), (19, 2)

Thus, there are 11 unique 3-stars in this graph.

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (6, 14, 15)>, <4, (7, 8, 12)>, <5, (10, 11, 5)>, <7, (2, 9, 10)>, <10, (5, 7, 15)>, <11, (6, 1, 5)>, <12, (6, 15, 4)>, <14, (3, 17, 0)>, <15, (6, 12, 10)>, <18, (0, 14, 0)>, <19, (2, 16, 2)>
