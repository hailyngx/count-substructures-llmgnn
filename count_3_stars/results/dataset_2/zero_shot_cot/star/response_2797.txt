Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 18) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 10) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 9, 19, 11. (<4, (9, 19, 11)>)
2. Node 8 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 10, 17, 0. (<8, (10, 17, 0)>)
3. Node 7 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 12, 15, 19. (<7, (12, 15, 19)>)
4. Node 12 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 7, 14, 9. (<12, (7, 14, 9)>)
5. Node 0 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 8, connected to node 8 already. So, no new 3-star.
6. Node 14 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 12, 9, connected to node 12 already. So, no new 3-star.
7. Node 3 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 11, 2, connected to node 11 already. So, no new 3-star.
8. Node 1 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 17, 16, 18. (<1, (17, 16, 18)>)
9. Node 13 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 17, 15, 19. (<13, (17, 15, 19)>)
10. Node 2 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 3, 5, 9. (<2, (3, 5, 9)>)
11. Node 5 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 2, 16 connected to node 2 already. So, no new 3-star.
12. Node 6 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 13, 10 connected to node 13 already. So, no new 3-star.
13. Node 15 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 7, 13 connected to node 7 already. So, no new 3-star.
14. Node 19 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 4, 7, 13 connected to node 7 already. So, no new 3-star.
15. Node 16 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 1, 5, 18 connected to node 1 and 5 already. So, no new 3-star.
16. Node 10 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 8, 6, 16 connected to node 8 and 6 already. So, no new 3-star.
17. Node 18 is a central node in a 3-star with leaves 11, 1, 16 connected to node 1 already. So, no new 3-star.

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [5] unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the answer is [5].
