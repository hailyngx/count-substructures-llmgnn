Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 17) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 13) (18, 11) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, let's search for such structures:

1. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 11, 1)>
2. Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (9, 8, 3)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (2, 3, 19)>
4. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (5, 10, 4)>
5. Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (19, 12, 17)>
6. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (17, 12, 16)>
7. Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (8, 13, 18)>
8. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (9, 7, 0)>
9. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (9, 3, 19)>
10. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (11, 1, 16)>
11. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (10, 16, 2)>
12. Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (13, 1, 4)>

There are a total of 12 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
