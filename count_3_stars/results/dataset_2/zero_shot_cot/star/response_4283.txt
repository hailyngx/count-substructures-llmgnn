Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every possible combination of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Based on the provided edges, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

- <0, (9, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
