Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 7) (26, 17) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 1) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 17) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 22) (25, 27) (25, 3) (25, 2) (18, 27) (18, 22) (22, 3) (22, 18) (22, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 7) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 11) (29, 0) (29, 14) (29, 4) (29, 21) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 10) (6, 12) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 12) (21, 26) (21, 29) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 2) (17, 26) (17, 27) (20, 21) (20, 23) (19, 15) (19, 23) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (23, 9) (23, 20) (23, 19) (16, 5) (16, 4) (24, 1) (24, 14) (2, 0) (2, 25) (2, 1) (2, 21) (8, 22) (8, 7) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 24) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (10, 6) (4, 29) (4, 15) (4, 16) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (27, 29, 1)>
2. <3, (25, 22, 7)>
3. <6, (28, 21, 10)>
4. <11, (28, 5, 12)>
5. <14, (29, 24, 15)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars, which is 5.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
