Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Central node 1: Leaves 3, 4, 5
- Central node 4: Leaves 1, 3, 5
- Central node 5: Leaves 1, 4, 8
- Central node 8: Leaves 4, 5, 7
- Central node 9: Leaves 1, 6, 8

Now, counting the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
