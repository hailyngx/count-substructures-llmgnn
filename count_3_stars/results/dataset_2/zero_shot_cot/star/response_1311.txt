Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 13) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 13) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 17) (11, 9) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 13) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 8) (17, 18) (4, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that have exactly three edges incident to them, which corresponds to the number of 3-stars in the graph.

From the given edges, the nodes and their degree (number of incident edges) are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 5
- Node 19: degree 3

Nodes with degree 3 and degree 4 are potential centers of 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are as follows:
<5, (9, 14, 16)>
<9, (5, 11, 15)>
<15, (9, 13, 19)>
<19, (3, 11, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
