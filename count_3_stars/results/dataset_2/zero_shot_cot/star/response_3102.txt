Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 10) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its leaf nodes for each 3-star configuration.  

Let's identify the 3-star configurations:

<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<7, (4, 6, 10)>
<6, (7, 2, 11)>
<9, (2, 14, 10)>
<8, (14, 11, 0)>
<13, (4, 6, 10)>
<0, (4, 8, 14)>
<14, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (4, 14, 1)>
<12, (4, 9, 11)>
<10, (7, 9, 13)>
<3, (9, 0, 14)>
<1, (7, 5, 10)>
<11, (6, 8, 12)>
<2, (7, 6, 9)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
