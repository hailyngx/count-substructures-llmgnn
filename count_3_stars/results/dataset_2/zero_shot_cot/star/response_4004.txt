Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph.

The possible 3-star structures are as follows:
<5, (1, 0, 7)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>
<4, (9, 7, 0)>
<7, (5, 4, 2)>
<6, (4, 1, -)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
