Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 27) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 1) (26, 5) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 12) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 19) (6, 7) (6, 25) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (25, 6) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 24) (27, 9) (27, 25) (27, 13) (2, 5) (2, 17) (12, 26) (12, 24) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 20) (16, 18) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 20) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 13) (15, 19) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 20) (7, 9) (7, 23) (7, 6) (29, 25) (1, 23) (1, 10) (3, 26) (3, 24) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 16) (14, 3) (17, 21) (17, 2) (20, 21) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 19) (22, 21) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, we will identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes with a degree of 3. 

Nodes with degree 3: 
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 9, 26, 2)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 5, 11, 7)
- Node 26 (connected to nodes 5, 28, 21)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 26, 24, 14)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 0, 18, 20)
- Node 11 (connected to nodes 5, 9, 24)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 9, 23, 6)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 5, 17, 21)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 16, 3, *no other connection*)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 27, 24, 18)
- Node 18 (connected to nodes 10, 16, 13)

Now, we will list out the unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 26, 2)>
<9, (5, 11, 7)>
<26, (5, 28, 21)>
<3, (26, 24, 14)>
<10, (0, 18, 20)>
<11, (5, 9, 24)>
<7, (9, 23, 6)>
<2, (5, 17, 21)>
<14, (16, 3, *no other connection*)>
<13, (27, 24, 18)>
<18, (10, 16, 13)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
[10]
