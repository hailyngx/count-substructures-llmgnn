Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 13) (16, 8) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 16) (13, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 15) (3, 14) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 19) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in a 3-star pattern. 
Nodes that have 3 edges connected to them are potential centers of 3-stars. 

Candidates for central nodes: 0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18

Now, let's examine each of these potential central nodes:

Node 0: (0, 11, 4), (0, 8, 5) [2 3-star found]
Node 4: (4, 9, 18), (4, 15, 0), (4, 2, 5) [3 3-stars found]
Node 8: (8, 16, 17), (8, 7, 0) [2 3-stars found]
Node 9: (9, 6, 4), (9, 2, 5) [2 3-stars found]
Node 10: (10, 17, 18), (10, 12, 5), (10, 19, 0) [3 3-stars found]
Node 11: (11, 0, 18), (11, 15, 4) [2 3-stars found]
Node 12: (12, 10, 17), (12, 5, 2) [2 3-stars found]
Node 15: (15, 11, 4), (15, 1, 0) [2 3-stars found]
Node 17: (17, 8, 10), (17, 1, 18), (17, 12, 5) [3 3-stars found]
Node 18: (18, 11, 10), (18, 4, 9), (18, 1, 19) [3 3-stars found]

There are a total of 19 unique 3-stars in the graph.
