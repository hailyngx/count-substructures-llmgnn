Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 16) (15, 8) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 14) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 7) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 19) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can list the unique 3-stars:

<3, (1, 8, 11)>
<8, (3, 12, 13)>
<13, (8, 10, 19)>
<2, (4, 6, 18)>
<18, (2, 17, 19)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

[5]
