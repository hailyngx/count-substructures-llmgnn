Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, we identify the nodes that form a 3-star. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with three incident edges.

Nodes with three incident edges are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, 13, 0, 14, 5, 2, and 10.

Now, we list the 3-stars:
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 10, 14)>
<1, (4, 3, 2)>
<3, (1, 14, 6)>
<8, (9, 0, 5)>
<13, (7, 12, 6)>
<0, (8, 11, 9)>
<14, (7, 3, 11)>
<5, (8, 10, 3)>
<2, (1, 9, 10)>
<10, (7, 0, 5)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars:
