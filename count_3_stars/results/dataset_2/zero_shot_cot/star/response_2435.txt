Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 18) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 16) (13, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 4) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 6) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 18) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph based on the given edges:

1. Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 11, 15, and 9: <3, (11, 15, 9)>
2. Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 11, 1, and 9: <4, (11, 1, 9)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 16, 15, and 2: <7, (16, 15, 2)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 13, 19, and 14: <8, (13, 19, 14)>
5. Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 5, 17, and 6: <12, (5, 17, 6)>
6. Node 16 forms a 3-star with leaves 13, 18, and 7: <16, (13, 18, 7)>
7. Node 19 forms a 3-star with leaves 11, 8, and 6: <19, (11, 8, 6)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars we found. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
