Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all nodes with 3 connections (degree 3) since they could potentially be the centers of 3-stars. Then, we check if each of their connections forms a 3-star pattern.

The nodes with degree 3 are: 5, 9, 6, 8, 0, 2, 1, and 3.

Analyzing each potential center:
- Node 5: <5, (9, 1, 0)> and <5, (9, 2, 3)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 8)> and <9, (1, 0, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 7)> and <6, (1, 7, 2)>
- Node 8: <8, (9, 4, 7)>
- Node 0: <0, (5, 9, 6)> and <0, (5, 8, 2)>
- Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 4)>
- Node 1: <1, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 3: <3, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (9, 1, 0)>, 
<5, (9, 2, 3)>, 
<9, (5, 6, 8)>, 
<9, (1, 0, 7)>, 
<6, (9, 1, 7)>, 
<6, (1, 7, 2)>, 
<8, (9, 4, 7)>, 
<0, (5, 9, 6)>, 
<0, (5, 8, 2)>, and 
<3, (5, 7, 8)>.
