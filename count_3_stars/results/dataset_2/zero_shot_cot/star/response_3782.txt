Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
- Node 1 has 3 leaves (4, 6, 8)
- Node 3 has 2 leaves (1, 2, 2 edges to node 2)
- Node 2 has 4 leaves (3, 5, 8, 4)
- Node 5 has 3 leaves (6, 2, 8)
- Node 6 has 3 leaves (1, 5, 8)
- Node 8 has 4 leaves (1, 5, 6, 2)
- Node 0 has 2 leaves (2, 7)
- Node 7 has 4 leaves (5, 2, 8, 0)
- Node 9 has 2 leaves (0, 4)

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 8)> 
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 2, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (5, 2, 8)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
