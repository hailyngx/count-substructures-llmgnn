Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From node 1: <1, (6, 9, 3)>
2. From node 2: <2, (9, 1, 3)>
3. From node 3: <3, (1, 2, 0)>
4. From node 4: <4, (8, 2, 0)>
5. From node 5: <5, (1, 2, 0)>
6. From node 6: <6, (1, 7, 9)>
7. From node 7: <7, (6, 9, 0)>
8. From node 8: <8, (4, 1, 0)>
9. From node 9: <9, (6, 7, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9] 3-stars.
