Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (17, 4) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 10) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (12, 5) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<11, (16, 14, 6)>
<16, (11, 0, 8)>
<1, (9, 8, 15)>
<3, (7, 19, 18)>
<8, (16, 1, 13)>
<13, (8, 2, 15)>
<2, (13, 18, 0)>
<18, (3, 2, 19)>
<5, (6, 19, 12)>
<6, (11, 5, 14)>
<0, (16, 2, unconnected)>
<14, (11, 6, 15)>
<19, (3, 18, 5)>
<7, (3, 10, unconnected)>
<4, (19, 17, 10)>
<9, (1, 15, 10)>
<15, (11, 8, 18)>

Now, to count the number of 3-stars, we simply count the number of unique 3-stars found above.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
