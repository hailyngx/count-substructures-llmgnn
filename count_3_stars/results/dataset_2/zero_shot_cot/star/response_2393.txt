Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. In a 3-star, the center node will have three edges connected to it. Let's list these nodes:

- Node 5 has 4 edges connected
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected
- Node 4 has 3 edges connected
- Node 7 has 3 edges connected
- Node 2 has 5 edges connected
- Node 8 has 5 edges connected
- Node 0 has 5 edges connected
- Node 3 has 5 edges connected
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (5, 0, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 8)>
<0, (5, 2, 4)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<8, (6, 7, 2)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (2, 6, 0)>
<1, (4, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
