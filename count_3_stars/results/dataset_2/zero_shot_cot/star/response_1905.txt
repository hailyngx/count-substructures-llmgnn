Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 20) (14, 16) (17, 25) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 5) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 1) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 24) (25, 17) (25, 6) (25, 2) (23, 13) (23, 2) (23, 24) (28, 8) (28, 7) (29, 27) (29, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 9) (26, 18) (26, 24) (26, 11) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 26) (24, 5) (6, 18) (6, 25) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 16) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 2) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 15) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 24) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 6) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 11) (8, 27) (7, 28) (7, 10) (19, 17) (19, 11) (27, 29) (27, 8) (12, 0) (12, 21) (20, 22) (20, 9) (15, 18) (15, 16) (15, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 25) (2, 23) (2, 21) (2, 15) (4, 29) (4, 10) (9, 0) (9, 20) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 18)>
<2, (15, 21, 23)>
<3, (13, 17, 24)>
<4, (10, 29, 4)>
<5, (13, 17, 24)>
<6, (1, 18, 21)>
<7, (8, 10, 28)>
<8, (11, 21, 27)>
<9, (0, 20, 9)>
<10, (4, 7, 29)>
<11, (3, 19, 26)>
<12, (0, 21, 12)>
<13, (3, 5, 23)>
<14, (16, 15, 6)>
<15, (2, 16, 15)>
<16, (6, 14, 15)>
<17, (3, 5, 25)>
<18, (1, 6, 22)>
<19, (11, 17, 26)>
<20, (0, 9, 22)>
<21, (2, 6, 12)>
<22, (18, 20, 13)>
<23, (2, 13, 24)>
<24, (3, 5, 23)>
<25, (2, 17, 6)>
<26, (11, 18, 24)>
<27, (8, 21, 29)>
<28, (7, 8, 21)>
<29, (4, 10, 27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
