Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (3, 7) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph. 
Let's represent each node and its neighbors for better visualization:

1: (8, 11, 4, 14)
2: (5, 9, 12, 0)
3: (7)
4: (8, 10, 11, 14, 6)
5: (13, 2, 11, 7)
6: (4, 14)
7: (5, 8, 10, 12, 3)
8: (4, 10, 0, 1, 7)
9: (2, 13, 12)
10: (8, 11, 12, 7, 4)
11: (5, 10, 14, 1, 4)
12: (9, 13, 10, 7, 2)
13: (5, 9, 12)
14: (11, 4, 0, 6, 1)
0: (8, 14, 2)
 
Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by considering each node as the potential center:

- Node 1: (8, 11, 4, 14) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 2: (5, 9, 12, 0) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 3: (7) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 4: (8, 10, 11, 14, 6) -> <4, (8, 10, 11)>
- Node 5: (13, 2, 11, 7) -> <5, (13, 2, 11)>
- Node 6: (4, 14) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 7: (5, 8, 10, 12, 3) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 8: (4, 10, 0, 1, 7) -> <8, (4, 10, 0)>
- Node 9: (2, 13, 12) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 10: (8, 11, 14, 1, 4) -> <10, (8, 11, 14)>
- Node 11: (5, 10, 14, 1, 4) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 12: (9, 13, 10, 7, 2) -> <12, (9, 13, 10)>
- Node 13: (5, 9, 12) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 14: (11, 4, 0, 6, 1) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 0: (8, 14, 2) -> Not a 3-star

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (8, 10, 11)>
<5, (13, 2, 11)>
<10, (8, 11, 14)>
