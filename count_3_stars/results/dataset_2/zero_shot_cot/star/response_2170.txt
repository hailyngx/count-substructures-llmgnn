Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<8, (5, 1, 6)>
<6, (7, 8, 0)>
<0, (4, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
