Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 7) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 19) (11, 8) (11, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 16) (5, 15) (5, 0) (19, 3) (6, 1) (6, 15) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 7) (9, 13) (9, 7) (18, 13) (18, 1) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node of a 3-star:

Node 14 is connected to nodes 17 and 8.
Node 17 is connected to nodes 14 and 7.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 14, 13, and 11.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 18.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 0, and 19.
Node 11 is connected to nodes 8 and 3.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 15, 6, and 18.
Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 6, and 16.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 15 and 0.
Node 19 is connected to node 3.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 15.
Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 15, 5, and 10.
Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 0.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 16, and 7.
Node 12 is connected to node 2.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 17, 2, and 16.
Node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 15, 2, and 7.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 13 and 7.
Node 18 is connected to nodes 13 and 1.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 10.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 8: <14, (17, 8)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 13, 11: <8, (14, 13, 11)>.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 9, 18: <13, (8, 9, 18)>.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 0, 19: <3, (11, 0, 19)>.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 6, 18: <1, (15, 6, 18)>.
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 0, 6: <15, (1, 0, 6)>, and another with nodes 1, 16, 5: <15, (1, 16, 5)>.
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 15, 5: <0, (3, 15, 5)>, and another with nodes 3, 10, 4: <0, (3, 10, 4)>.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 12, 7: <2, (10, 12, 7)>.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 15, 7: <16, (8, 15, 7)>.

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
