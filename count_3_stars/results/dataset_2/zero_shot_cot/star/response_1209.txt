Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (18, 4) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (0, 13) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 0) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 11) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 9) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 5) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 2) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) (5, 16) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) 

Response:
The first step to solve this problem is to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's list the 3-star patterns <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> found in the graph:
<4, (7, 13, 18)>
<7, (4, 6, 17)>
<10, (6, 15, 16)>
<15, (4, 10, 11)>
<16, (9, 12, 5)>
<17, (1, 7, 13)>
<19, (2, 11, 17)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [7].
