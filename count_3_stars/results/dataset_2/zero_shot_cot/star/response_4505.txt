Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 11) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) 

Response:
The first step is to find all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be our candidate central nodes for the 3-stars.

- Node 1 has 3 connected edges.
- Node 3 has 5 connected edges.
- Node 6 has 4 connected edges.
- Node 7 has 4 connected edges.
- Node 10 has 3 connected edges.
- Node 14 has 3 connected edges.

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 10)>
<6, (1, 3, 14)>
<7, (1, 10, 11)>
<10, (3, 6, 7)>
<14, (3, 4, 6)>

Finally, count the number of unique 3-stars: [6].
