Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 1) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (7, 18) (19, 6) (19, 13) 

Response:
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (6, 12, 17)>
<13, (3, 11, 19)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
