Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 5: (9, 10, 12)
- Node 9: (4, 7, 8),
- Node 4: (0, 13, 9)
- Node 7: (9, 12, 14)
- Node 1: (0, 3, 13)
- Node 3: (1, 9, 13)
- Node 8: (6, 9, 14)
- Node 13: (1, 3, 4)
- Node 10: (2, 9, 11)
- Node 11: (1, 10, 12)
- Node 6: (2, 5, 8)
- Node 12: (0, 5, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: 
[12]
