Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 5:
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 0.
   - <5, (9, 6, 0)>

2. Node 9:
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 7.
   - <9, (5, 8, 7)>

3. Node 4:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 0.
   - <4, (7, 8, 0)>

4. Node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 6.
   - <7, (9, 4, 6)>

5. Node 1:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 2.
   - <1, (7, 3, 2)>

6. Node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 0.
   - <3, (1, 8, 0)>

7. Node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 3.
   - <8, (9, 4, 3)>

8. Node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 0.
   - <6, (5, 7, 0)>

9. Node 2:
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 1.
   - <2, (4, 7, 1)>

10. Node 0:
    - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 4.
    - <0, (5, 9, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
