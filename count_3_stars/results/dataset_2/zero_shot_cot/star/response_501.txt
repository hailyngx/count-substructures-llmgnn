Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 12) (10, 3) (10, 5) (15, 12) (13, 18) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 5) (9, 18) (9, 11) (19, 6) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by identifying every node that satisfies the 3-star condition. Here's a step-by-step solution:

1. Identify the node degrees:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 1
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 1

2. Identify the 3-star configurations:
- <2, (18, 6, 11)>
- <3, (13, 5, 10)>
- <4, (8, 14, 17)>
- <6, (2, 18, 13)>
- <8, (4, 5, 6)>
- <14, (0, 4, 16)>
- <16, (1, 5, 14)>
- <18, (2, 9, 13)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [8]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
