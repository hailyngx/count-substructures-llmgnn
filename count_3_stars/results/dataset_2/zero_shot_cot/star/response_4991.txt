Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them, as these nodes can be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 4 and 8)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 4 and 5)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 8, 5, and 9)

Now, we list all the unique 3-star configurations:
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (8, 5, 9)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
