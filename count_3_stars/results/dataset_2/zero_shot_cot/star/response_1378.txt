Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 13) (14, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 3, 13)>
<1, (0, 7, 13)>
<2, (0, 7, 11)>
<3, (0, 7, 10)>
<4, (5, 6, 12)>
<5, (4, 7, 10)>
<6, (4, 8, 13)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (6, 10, 12)>
<9, (4, 11, 14)>
<10, (3, 5, 8)>
<11, (2, 9, 14)>
<12, (4, 8, 13)>
<13, (0, 1, 6)>
<14, (1, 9, 11)>

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
