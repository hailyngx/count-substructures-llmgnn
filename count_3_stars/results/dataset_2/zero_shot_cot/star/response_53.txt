Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (0, 2) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 13) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph.
1. <0, (2, 14, 19)>
2. <4, (3, 6, 18)>
3. <6, (4, 8, 13)>
4. <15, (7, 12, 18)>

[Final answer: 4]
