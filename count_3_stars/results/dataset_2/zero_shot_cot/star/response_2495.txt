Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 4) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<10, (0, 1, 7)>
<11, (8, 13, 14)>
<5, (2, 8, 13)>
<6, (0, 8, 10)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<12, (1, 7, 9)>
<13, (4, 11, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 13)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [8]
