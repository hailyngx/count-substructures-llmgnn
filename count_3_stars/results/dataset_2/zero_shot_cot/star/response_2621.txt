Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
