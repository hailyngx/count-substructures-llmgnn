Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 4) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (29, 26) (29, 14) (14, 29) (14, 3) (14, 25) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 4) (20, 17) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 22) (25, 14) (25, 20) (25, 4) (25, 18) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 28) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 15) (26, 29) (26, 0) (13, 17) (11, 28) (11, 27) (28, 5) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 15) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 25) (4, 27) (27, 11) (27, 4) (27, 24) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 10) (0, 26) (0, 28) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 23) (7, 20) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (24, 27) (24, 18) (24, 15) (18, 25) (18, 0) (18, 24) (23, 0) (23, 10) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 23) (22, 21) (22, 20) (22, 15) (15, 21) (15, 6) (15, 28) (15, 24) (15, 22) 

Response:
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's identify such nodes:

- Node 21 has three edges: (1, 21), (21, 3), and (21, 22).
- Node 14 has three edges: (29, 14), (14, 3), and (14, 25).
- Node 20 has three edges: (17, 20), (20, 25), and (20, 7).
- Node 5 has three edges: (2, 5), (5, 6), and (5, 28).
- Node 6 has three edges: (2, 6), (6, 5), and (6, 15).
- Node 4 has three edges: (1, 4), (4, 17), and (4, 25).
- Node 27 has three edges: (11, 27), (27, 4), and (27, 24).
- Node 3 has three edges: (21, 3), (3, 14), and (3, 0).
- Node 12 has three edges: (9, 12), (12, 16), and (16, 12).
- Node 16 has three edges: (17, 16), (16, 12), and (16, 10).
- Node 0 has three edges: (26, 0), (0, 28), and (0, 3).
- Node 18 has three edges: (25, 18), (0, 18), and (18, 24).
- Node 10 has three edges: (9, 10), (10, 16), and (10, 23).
- Node 22 has three edges: (21, 22), (22, 20), and (22, 15).

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (21, 3, 22)>
<14, (29, 3, 25)>
<4, (1, 17, 25)>
<20, (17, 25, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 28)>
<6, (2, 5, 15)>
<27, (11, 4, 24)>
<3, (21, 14, 0)>
<12, (9, 16, 12)>
<16, (17, 12, 10)>
<0, (26, 28, 3)>
<18, (25, 0, 24)>
<10, (9, 16, 23)>
<22, (21, 20, 15)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in this graph.
