Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 13) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 6) (11, 2) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 8) (8, 19) (8, 9) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 2) (15, 7) (15, 5) (10, 3) (10, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 16) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 18) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 has neighbors 17, 4, 18 forming 3-star <0, (17, 4, 18)>
- Node 1 has neighbors 9, 4, 16 forming 3-star <1, (9, 4, 16)>
- Node 2 has neighbors 7, 17, 16 forming 3-star <2, (7, 17, 16)>
- Node 3 has neighbors 10, 16 forming 3-star <3, (10, 16, 1)>
- Node 4 has neighbors 17, 12, 1 forming 3-star <4, (17, 12, 1)>
- Node 5 has neighbors 12, 15, 19 forming 3-star <5, (12, 15, 19)>
- Node 6 has neighbors 11, 13, 19 forming 3-star <6, (11, 13, 19)>
- Node 7 has neighbors 14, 12, 15 forming 3-star <7, (14, 12, 15)>
- Node 8 has neighbors 19, 9, 8 forming 3-star <8, (19, 9, 8)>
- Node 9 has neighbors 12, 1, 8 forming 3-star <9, (12, 1, 8)>
- Node 10 has neighbors 3, 13, 16 forming 3-star <10, (3, 13, 16)>
- Node 11 has neighbors 6, 2, 2 forming 3-star <11, (6, 2, 6)>
- Node 12 has neighbors 7, 5, 9 forming 3-star <12, (7, 5, 9)>
- Node 13 has neighbors 10, 6, 13 forming 3-star <13, (10, 6, 13)>
- Node 14 has neighbors 17, 7, 18 forming 3-star <14, (17, 7, 18)>
- Node 15 has neighbors 7, 5, 15 forming 3-star <15, (7, 5, 15)>
- Node 16 has neighbors 7, 3, 1 forming 3-star <16, (7, 3, 1)>
- Node 17 has neighbors 14, 4, 0 forming 3-star <17, (14, 4, 0)>
- Node 18 has neighbors 14, 0, 18 forming 3-star <18, (14, 0, 18)>
- Node 19 has neighbors 5, 6, 8 forming 3-star <19, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [19].
