Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, and 7: <5, (9, 3, 7)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 3: <9, (5, 8, 3)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 2: <7, (4, 0, 2)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 1: <4, (7, 8, 1)>
5. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 2: <1, (4, 3, 2)>
6. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 4: <3, (5, 9, 4)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 2: <8, (9, 4, 2)>
8. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 8: <6, (4, 3, 8)>
9. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 1, and 8: <2, (7, 1, 8)>
10. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 2: <0, (9, 7, 2)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [10].
