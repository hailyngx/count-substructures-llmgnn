Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 9) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 6) (2, 17) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (6, 8) (6, 19) (18, 11) (18, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 17, and 13.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 16, 7, and 14.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 14, and 0.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 8, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 17, 5, and 6.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 15, 10, and 13.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 17, 12, and 18.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 2, and 18.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by looking at nodes that form a 3-star pattern. 

<4, (11, 3, 7)>
<7, (4, 10, 8)>
<8, (7, 17, 13)>
<9, (16, 7, 14)>
<15, (3, 14, 0)>
<17, (14, 8, 19)>
<19, (17, 5, 6)>
<0, (15, 10, 13)>
<2, (17, 12, 18)>
<12, (13, 2, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
