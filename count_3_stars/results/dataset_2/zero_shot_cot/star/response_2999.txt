Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 7) (8, 29) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 27) (13, 16) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 29) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 4) (7, 26) (7, 12) (7, 20) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 18) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 0) (29, 8) (29, 10) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 14) (21, 13) (21, 28) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 25) (16, 13) (16, 22) (16, 27) (22, 26) (22, 16) (14, 29) (14, 20) (6, 17) (6, 24) (6, 19) (24, 6) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 25) (15, 23) (19, 6) (19, 3) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 19) (3, 0) (20, 26) (20, 7) (20, 14) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 15) (23, 2) (27, 8) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 2) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 1) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 1) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 18) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 23) (2, 27) (25, 28) (25, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 8: (0, 12, 27)
- From node 13: (2, 16, 21)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <8, (0, 12, 27)> and <13, (2, 16, 21)>.
