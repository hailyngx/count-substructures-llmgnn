Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 12) (2, 27) (29, 9) (29, 24) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 27) (21, 10) (21, 5) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 25) (18, 1) (26, 18) (26, 6) (26, 17) (28, 17) (28, 27) (10, 21) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 20) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 20) (9, 29) (9, 8) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (11, 17) (11, 20) (23, 25) (23, 6) (3, 7) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 5) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 11) (20, 1) (17, 26) (17, 28) (17, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 25) (25, 18) (25, 16) (25, 23) (25, 13) (25, 24) (24, 29) (24, 25) (24, 27) (27, 2) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 24) (14, 12) (14, 1) (5, 21) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 1) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 3) (6, 26) (6, 16) (6, 23) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given input:

1. From node 18, we have a 3-star: <18, (4, 25, 26)>
2. From node 10, we have a 3-star: <10, (21, 5, 20)>
3. From node 0, we have a 3-star: <0, (15, 1, 19)>
4. From node 1, we have a 3-star: <1, (18, 5, 20)>
5. From node 8, we have a 3-star: <8, (10, 9, 20)>
6. From node 20, we have a 3-star: <20, (10, 11, 1)>
7. From node 17, we have a 3-star: <17, (26, 28, 11)>
8. From node 25, we have a 3-star: <25, (18, 16, 13)>
9. From node 5, we have a 3-star: <5, (21, 4, 1)>
10. From node 19, we have a 3-star: <19, (7, 0, 3)>
11. From node 27, we have a 3-star: <27, (2, 7, 28)>
12. From node 29, we have a 3-star: <29, (9, 24, 27)>
13. From node 4, we have a 3-star: <4, (18, 5, 21)>
14. From node 15, we have a 3-star: <15, (10, 8, 0)>
15. From node 13, we have a 3-star: <13, (0, 12, 25)>
16. From node 6, we have a 3-star: <6, (26, 16, 23)>
17. From node 12, we have a 3-star: <12, (2, 13, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [17].
