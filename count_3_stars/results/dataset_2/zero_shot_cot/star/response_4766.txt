Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <6, (9, 2, 4)>
2. <9, (6, 8, 1)>
3. <5, (1, 7, -)> (Node 5 does not have 3 edges connected)
4. <2, (6, 7, -)> (Node 2 does not have 3 edges connected)
5. <8, (9, 7, 3)>
6. <0, (9, 7, 3)>
7. <7, (5, 2, 8)>
8. <1, (6, 9, 5)>
9. <3, (9, 8, 0)>
10. <4, (6, 0, 1)>

So, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
