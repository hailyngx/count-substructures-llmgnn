Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 5 since the 3-star will have node 5 as its center. The nodes connected to node 5 are: 3, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, for each of these nodes connected to node 5, we need to check if they have two edges connecting them to other nodes. If so, we have a 3-star. 

- For node 3: (3, 5), (3, 9)
  <5, (3, 9)>

- For node 7: (7, 5), (7, 0)
  <5, (7, 0)>

- For node 8: (8, 5), (8, 7)
  <5, (8, 7)>

- For node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6)
  <5, (9, 6)>

Now count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [4]
