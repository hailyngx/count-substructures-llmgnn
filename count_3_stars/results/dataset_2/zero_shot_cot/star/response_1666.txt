Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
There are <5, (9, 11, 3)>, <4, (8, 1, 14)>, and <10, (1, 11, 12)> 3-stars in the graph.
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
