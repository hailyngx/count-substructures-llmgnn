Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 10) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and the leaves connected to each central node:
- Central Node 1: Leaves 3, 13, 4
- Central Node 3: Leaves 1, 7, 6
- Central Node 4: Leaves 1, 8, 12
- Central Node 5: No 3-star (since a 3-star requires exactly 3 leaves)
- Central Node 6: No 3-star
- Central Node 7: No 3-star
- Central Node 8: No 3-star
- Central Node 9: No 3-star
- Central Node 10: No 3-star
- Central Node 11: No 3-star
- Central Node 12: No 3-star
- Central Node 13: No 3-star
- Central Node 14: No 3-star

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Central Node 1: 1 3-star
- Central Node 3: 1 3-star
- Central Node 4: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 13, 4)>, <3, (1, 7, 6)>, <4, (1, 8, 12)>.
