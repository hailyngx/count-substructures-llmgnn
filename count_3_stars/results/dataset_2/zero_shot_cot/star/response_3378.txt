Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look for each node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it (forming a 3-star).

From the given edges, we can identify the nodes with their connected edges:
- Node 0: (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 9) (5, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2)
- Node 8: (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0)
- Node 9: (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.
[There are 4 3-stars in the graph.]

<0, (9, 2, 4)>
<1, (3, 2, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (9, 6, 0)>
