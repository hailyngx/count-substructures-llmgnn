Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 0) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 10) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 0) (8, 5) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 3) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 3) 

Response:
The center of a 3-star must have exactly 3 edges connected to it. Let's identify the potential centers in the graph by listing the degrees of all nodes:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 5
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 1
Node 10: degree 4
Node 11: degree 3
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 5
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: (1, 14, 11)
- Node 7: (7, 16, 15)
- Node 11: (11, 4, 13)
- Node 13: (13, 3, 17)
- Node 14: (14, 6, 4)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].

<1, (14, 11, 13)>
<7, (16, 15, 0)>
<11, (4, 13, 17)>
<13, (3, 17, 0)>
<14, (6, 4, 1)>
