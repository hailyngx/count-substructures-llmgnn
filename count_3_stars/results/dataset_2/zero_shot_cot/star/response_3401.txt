Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 12) (27, 6) (27, 13) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 7) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 18) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 8) (25, 4) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 11) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 29) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 15) (13, 27) (13, 5) (13, 6) (7, 1) (7, 11) (29, 20) (29, 26) (29, 21) (28, 22) (28, 14) (14, 28) (14, 2) (18, 3) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 24) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 22) (24, 0) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 4) (15, 26) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 9) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 4) (9, 15) (22, 17) (22, 28) (22, 11) (22, 8) (8, 25) (8, 22) (8, 6) (12, 0) (12, 24) (12, 21) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 23) (21, 29) (21, 12) (21, 2) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 21) (6, 27) (6, 13) (6, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star and then count them. 

Let's start by finding all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (16, 24, 12)>
<27, (6, 13, 27)>
<1, (26, 17, 7)>
<3, (23, 5, 18)>
<20, (25, 29, 11)>
<25, (20, 25, 4)>
<10, (2, 10, 14)>
<17, (1, 17, 23)>
<26, (1, 26, 15)>
<5, (3, 5, 13)>
<13, (5, 13, 6)>
<7, (1, 7, 11)>
<29, (20, 29, 26)>
<28, (22, 28, 14)>
<14, (2, 14, 28)>
<18, (3, 5, 18)>
<19, (15, 18, 19)>
<16, (0, 16, 24)>
<11, (7, 11, 20)>
<9, (15, 9, 15)>
<22, (17, 22, 28)>
<8, (6, 8, 25)>
<12, (0, 12, 24)>
<21, (12, 21, 29)>
<4, (4, 24, 25)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars: [25]
