Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be calculated by checking each node as the central node, and then counting the number of possible 3-stars around it. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0: (1, 6, 8), (2, 6, 11), (1, 8, 9) -> <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 11)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- Node 1: (0, 6, 7), (0, 6, 9) -> <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- Node 2: (0, 6, 11) -> <2, (0, 6, 11)>
- Node 3: No 3-star
- Node 4: (6, 9, 11) -> <4, (6, 9, 11)>
- Node 5: (2, 7, 11) -> <5, (2, 7, 11)>
- Node 6: (0, 1, 7), (0, 2, 6), (4, 9, 11) -> <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (4, 9, 11)>
- Node 7: (0, 1, 6), (1, 5, 10) -> <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 10)>
- Node 8: (0, 1, 9), (0, 12, 13) -> <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 12, 13)>
- Node 9: (0, 2, 8), (1, 4, 9) -> <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>
- Node 10: (5, 7, 11), (6, 10, 11) -> <10, (5, 7, 11)>, <10, (6, 10, 11)>
- Node 11: (4, 5, 6), (2, 5, 10), (4, 6, 11) -> <11, (4, 5, 6)>, <11, (2, 5, 10)>, <11, (4, 6, 11)>
- Node 12: (0, 8, 13), (2, 4, 12) -> <12, (0, 8, 13)>, <12, (2, 4, 12)>
- Node 13: (0, 8, 12), (3, 8, 13) -> <13, (0, 8, 12)>, <13, (3, 8, 13)>
- Node 14: (11, 14, 5) -> <14, (11, 14, 5)>

As every unique 3-star is counted, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
