Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 2) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the nodes with three neighbors, as those will form the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we can list the unique 3-stars formed by each of these central nodes.

Nodes with three neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 8, 7, 12, 11, 2, 1, 13

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 10, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 4)>
<7, (9, 12, 11)>
<12, (4, 7, 13)>
<11, (8, 7, 3)>
<2, (7, 12, 1)>
<1, (5, 0, 2)>
<13, (12, 0, 1)>
