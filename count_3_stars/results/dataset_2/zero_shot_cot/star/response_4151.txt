Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 2) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 4) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 12) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (8, 1) (19, 11) (19, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 15) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (16, 2) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 9) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 18) (5, 4) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 6) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 18) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 7) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly 3 connections:
- Node 14 has connections with nodes 18, 2, and 5.
- Node 17 has connections with nodes 10, 15, and 4.
- Node 10 has connections with nodes 17, 3, and 12.
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 2, 13, and 9.
- Node 2 has connections with nodes 14, 0, and 16.
- Node 11 has connections with nodes 2, 19, and 15.
- Node 5 has connections with nodes 14, 1, and 18.
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 17, 5, and 13.
- Node 13 has connections with nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 12 has connections with nodes 10, 15, and 9.

2. Counting unique 3-stars:
- From the identified nodes, we have the following unique 3-stars:
    <0, (2, 13, 9)>
    <2, (0, 14, 16)>
    <4, (5, 13, 17)>
    <5, (1, 4, 18)>
    <9, (0, 7, 12)>
    <10, (3, 12, 17)>
    <13, (0, 3, 4)>
    <14, (2, 5, 18)>
    <15, (10, 12, 17)>
    <17, (4, 10, 15)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
   [10]
