Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 9) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (19, 2) (19, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 16) (12, 3) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 10) (3, 18) (3, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 8) (14, 18) (14, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 1) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 14) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 15) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 11: <11, (16, 7, 13)>
2. From node 16: <16, (11, 0, 12)>
3. From node 5: <5, (6, 18, 4)>
4. From node 6: <6, (5, 7, 2)>
5. From node 0: <0, (16, 15, 17)>
6. From node 18: <18, (5, 9, 14)>
7. From node 19: <19, (2, 13, -)>
8. From node 7: <7, (11, 6, -)>
9. From node 12: <12, (16, 3, -)>
10. From node 9: <9, (0, 18, 10)>
11. From node 3: <3, (18, 12, -)>
12. From node 17: <17, (5, 0, 8)>
13. From node 14: <14, (18, 8, -)>
14. From node 1: <1, (2, 10, -)>
15. From node 2: <2, (6, 19, 1)>
16. From node 8: <8, (11, 17, 14)>
17. From node 15: <15, (5, 0, 13)>
18. From node 13: <13, (11, 19, 15)>
19. From node 10: <10, (9, 1, 4)>
20. From node 4: <4, (5, 13, 10)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [20].
