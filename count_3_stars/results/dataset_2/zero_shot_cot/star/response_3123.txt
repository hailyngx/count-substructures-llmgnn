Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 12) (12, 8) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 0) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 13) (18, 13) (18, 3) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 0, 13 -> <11, (16, 0, 13)>
2. Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 14 -> <16, (11, 8, 14)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 13 -> <6, (9, 0, 13)>
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 15 -> <9, (6, 8, 15)>
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 15 -> <4, (7, 10, 15)>
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 15 -> <7, (4, 0, 15)>
7. Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 6, 7 -> <0, (11, 6, 7)>
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 16, 9, 12 -> <8, (16, 9, 12)>
9. Node 12 is connected to node 8 -> Not a 3-star.
10. Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7 -> <15, (9, 4, 7)>
11. Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 15, 10 -> <19, (7, 15, 10)>
12. Node 17 is connected to node 0 -> Not a 3-star.
13. Node 1 is connected to node 14 -> Not a 3-star.
14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 11, 6, 10 -> <13, (11, 6, 10)>
15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 16, 9, 5 -> <14, (16, 9, 5)>
16. Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 19, 13 -> <10, (4, 19, 13)>
17. Node 18 is connected to nodes 13, 3 -> Not a 3-star.
18. Node 5 is connected to nodes 16, 15, 14 -> <5, (16, 15, 14)>
19. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 18, 5 -> <3, (4, 18, 5)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [9].
