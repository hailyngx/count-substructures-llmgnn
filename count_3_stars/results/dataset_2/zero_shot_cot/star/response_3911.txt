Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node by three edges, forming a 3-star.

For each node, count the number of edges that are connected to it. If a node has exactly three edges connected to it, then it is part of a 3-star. Identify the central node and the three leaf nodes to form a unique 3-star.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 14)>
<6, (9, 4, 13)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<7, (4, 10, 8)>
<10, (9, 5, 7)>
<11, (4, 7, 12)>
<1, (5, 14, 13)>
<3, (5, 10, 0)>
<8, (7, 2, 10)>
<13, (6, 1, 12)>
<2, (5, 8, 12)>
<12, (11, 13, 2)>
<14, (9, 6, 1)>
<0, (4, 1, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
