Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 16) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 17) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 7) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

The center node of a 3-star will have degree 3. In this graph, the nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 16, and 17.

Now, let's find the connections of these central nodes with other nodes to form 3-stars. The unique 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (14, 1, 5)>
<4, (6, 19, 8)>
<5, (12, 13, 0)>
<6, (10, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 17, 19)>
<12, (18, 16, 5)>
<13, (14, 5, 4)>
<16, (19, 12, 17)>
<17, (4, 8, 16)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
