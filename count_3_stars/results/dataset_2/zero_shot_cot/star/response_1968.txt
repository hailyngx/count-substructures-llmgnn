Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 1) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 5
- Node 2: degree = 4
- Node 3: degree = 5
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 4
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 6
- Node 9: degree = 3
- Node 10: degree = 5
- Node 11: degree = 2
- Node 12: degree = 2
- Node 13: degree = 4
- Node 14: degree = 3

Identifying the 3-star patterns:

<1, (5, 14, 13)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (1, 6, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
