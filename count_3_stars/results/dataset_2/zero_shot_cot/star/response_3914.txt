Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 10) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
The central nodes in the 3-stars must have exactly three neighbors. Let's identify them first:

1. Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 6, 13, 12, and 4.
2. Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 8, 2, and 7.
3. Node 4 has neighbors: 5, 7, 14, 11, and 3.
4. Node 7 has neighbors: 9, 4, 12, 0, and 8.
5. Node 6 has neighbors: 5, 1, 14, and 10.
6. Node 0 has neighbors: 7, 14, and 11.
7. Node 14 has neighbors: 4, 6, 0, 11, and 10.
8. Node 2 has neighbors: 9, 8, and 1.
9. Node 8 has neighbors: 9, 7, 2, 11, and 3.
10. Node 12 has neighbors: 5, 7, and 1.
11. Node 3 has neighbors: 4 and 8.
12. Node 11 has neighbors: 4, 0, 14, and 8.
13. Node 13 has neighbors: 5, 7, and 10.
14. Node 1 has neighbors: 6, 2, 8, and 12.
15. Node 10 has neighbors: 6, 14, and 13.

From the list above, the nodes that can be part of a 3-star structure are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 14, 8, 12, and 1.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<4, (7, 14, 11)>
<7, (9, 12, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 14)>
<14, (4, 6, 0)>
<8, (9, 2, 1)>
<12, (5, 7, 1)>
<1, (6, 2, 8)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [8]
