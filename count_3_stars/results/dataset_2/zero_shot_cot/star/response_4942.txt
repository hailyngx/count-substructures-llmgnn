Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (17, 8) (17, 21) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 16) (8, 21) (23, 2) (23, 9) (23, 19) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 19) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 27) (26, 0) (26, 12) (1, 4) (1, 19) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 21) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 3) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 24) (24, 3) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 14) (29, 21) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 29) (2, 23) (2, 26) (2, 25) (2, 16) (2, 9) (9, 23) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 26) (12, 9) (12, 14) (27, 13) (27, 26) (27, 24) (14, 24) (14, 12) (22, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (19, 23) (19, 20) (19, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern.

By looking at the given edges list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<21, (17, 8, 13)>
<26, (13, 2, 0)>
<13, (26, 21, 27)>
<6, (15, 0, 16)>
<3, (10, 11, 28)>
<15, (20, 4, 6)>
<20, (15, 19, 4)>
<8, (17, 28, 16)>
<0, (26, 7, 6)>
<7, (10, 25, 0)>
<16, (8, 2, 6)>
<27, (13, 26, 24)>
<24, (3, 6, 14)>
<9, (23, 2, 12)>
<12, (26, 9, 14)>
<2, (23, 26, 25)>
<4, (1, 15, 3)>
<5, (11, 10, 19)>
<19, (1, 20, 23)>
<11, (3, 5, 21)>
<25, (7, 2, 0)>
<1, (4, 19, 21)>
<14, (24, 12, 26)>
<22, (11, )>
<29, (21, )>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].
