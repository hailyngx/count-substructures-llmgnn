Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (7, 19) (13, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 19) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 18) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 1
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 5
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 3

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <1, (16, 6, 10)>
- <2, (17, 9, 18)>

Count the number of 3-stars: [2]
