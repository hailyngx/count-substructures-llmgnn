Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (11, 13) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 12) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 9) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 18) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 14) (6, 16) (6, 7) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that are part of 3-stars.

Let's examine each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star and list down all unique 3-stars found:

- Node 0: (0, 15, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 14, 18)
- Node 2: (2, 3, 12)
- Node 3: (3, 9, 2)
- Node 4: (4, 10, -)
- Node 5: (5, 10, 19), (5, 13, 16)
- Node 6: (6, 7, 16)
- Node 7: (7, 13, 16), (7, 16, 1), (7, 17, -)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 12)
- Node 9: (9, 3, 17), (9, 12, -)
- Node 10: (10, 4, 5), (10, 17, -)
- Node 11: (11, 13, -)
- Node 12: (12, 2, 18), (12, 8, 19), (12, 9, -)
- Node 13: (13, 7, 5), (13, 11, -)
- Node 14: (14, 1, 18)
- Node 15: (15, 19, 0)
- Node 16: (16, 6, 7), (16, 1, 5), (16, 0, -)
- Node 17: (17, 10, 7), (17, 9, 19), (17, 19, -)
- Node 18: (18, 1, 14), (18, 12, -)
- Node 19: (19, 10, 5), (19, 17, 15), (19, 5, 12)

Considering all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are <0, (15, 8), 1, (14, 18)>, <2, (3, 12), 9>, <5, (10, 19), 13>, <6, 7, 16>, <7, 1, 16>, <9, 3, 17>, <10, 4, 5>, <12, 2, 18>, <13, 5, 7>, <19, 5, 17>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
