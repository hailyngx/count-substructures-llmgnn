Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 28) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 10) (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 15) (18, 0) (18, 7) (14, 23) (14, 28) (14, 9) (17, 9) (15, 29) (15, 5) (15, 24) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 5) (20, 16) (5, 15) (5, 20) (5, 26) (5, 25) (16, 22) (16, 20) (16, 28) (28, 22) (28, 2) (28, 14) (28, 16) (28, 24) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 19) (23, 14) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 9) (23, 19) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 26) (26, 29) (26, 5) (26, 25) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 23) (19, 3) (19, 1) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 10) (1, 13) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 4) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 4) (12, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (6, 25) (6, 8) (24, 15) (24, 28) (24, 21) (9, 14) (9, 17) (9, 23) (8, 6) (8, 21) (21, 24) (21, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star graph must have exactly 3 neighbors. Let's identify all nodes that have 3 neighbors:

- Node 22 has 3 neighbors: 13, 19, 16
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 27, 3, 18
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 26
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors: 2, 14, 16
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 15, 20, 26
- Node 23 has 3 neighbors: 14, 20, 11
- Node 25 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 26
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors: 22, 11, 23
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 29, 18, 11
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 13, 20, 19
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 10, 4
- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 27, 3, 4
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 6, 21
- Node 24 has 2 neighbors: 15, 21
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 14, 17
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 29, 28
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 25, 8
- Node 21 has 2 neighbors: 24, 8
- Node 17 is not part of any 3-star since it has only 2 neighbors
- Node 12, 15, 11, 16, 13, 18, and 3 are not part of any 3-star since they either have 1 or 0 neighbors with an edge connecting them to the central node.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is 11.
