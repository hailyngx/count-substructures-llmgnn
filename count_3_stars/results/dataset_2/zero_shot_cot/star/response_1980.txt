Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 1) (9, 23) (26, 18) (26, 5) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 5) (1, 22) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (4, 24) (4, 20) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 21) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 21) (5, 26) (5, 27) (5, 1) (5, 17) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (7, 8) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 28) (29, 7) (2, 6) (2, 23) (2, 28) (19, 7) (19, 25) (19, 12) (21, 18) (21, 17) (16, 22) (10, 18) (10, 20) (23, 13) (23, 9) (23, 2) (25, 19) (25, 28) (25, 14) (14, 13) (14, 27) (14, 25) (14, 24) (14, 15) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 20) (28, 18) (28, 7) (28, 2) (28, 25) (15, 22) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 12) (11, 8) (11, 20) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 15) (20, 4) (20, 10) (20, 24) (20, 11) 

Response:
Counting the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 1
- Node 10 has degree 3
- Node 11 has degree 2
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 13 has degree 3
- Node 14 has degree 5
- Node 15 has degree 4
- Node 16 has degree 2
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 4
- Node 19 has degree 3
- Node 20 has degree 4
- Node 21 has degree 2
- Node 22 has degree 4
- Node 23 has degree 3
- Node 24 has degree 3
- Node 25 has degree 3
- Node 26 has degree 2
- Node 27 has degree 3
- Node 28 has degree 4
- Node 29 has degree 1

Identifying the 3-stars (a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes):
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 24, and 27 <14, (15, 24, 27)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 21, and 28 <18, (10, 21, 28)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 10, and 24 <20, (4, 10, 24)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 18, and 27 <26, (5, 18, 27)>
