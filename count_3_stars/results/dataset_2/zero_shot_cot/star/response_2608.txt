Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 6 has 3 neighbors (9, 7, 8)
   - Node 1 has 3 neighbors (9, 2, 4)
   - Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8)
   - Node 8 has 3 neighbors (6, 9, 4)
   - Node 5 has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 0)
   - Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 7)
   - Node 7 has 3 neighbors (6, 9, 0)
   - Node 2 has 3 neighbors (9, 1, 3)

2. For each node with exactly 3 neighbors, create a 3-star:
   - <6, (9, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (9, 2, 4)>
   - <4, (1, 3, 8)>
   - <8, (6, 9, 4)>
   - <5, (4, 8, 0)>
   - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <7, (6, 9, 0)>
   - <2, (9, 1, 3)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:  
   - Total count: 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
  
Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (9, 2, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 0)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
