Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first determine all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (7, 8, 12)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 9, 10)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 11)>
<8, (0, 2, 13)>
<9, (3, 9, 12)>
<10, (3, 10, 13)>
<11, (7, 11, 14)>
<12, (0, 9, 12)>
<13, (8, 10, 14)>
<14, (11, 13, 14)>

There are a total of 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [14].
