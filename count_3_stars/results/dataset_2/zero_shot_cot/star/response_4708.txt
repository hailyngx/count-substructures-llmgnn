Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<8, (4, 9, 5)>
<1, (4, 8, 5)>
<5, (8, 6, 1)>
<6, (8, 5, 1)>
<0, (2, 3, 1)>
<2, (4, 0, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>
<3, (7, 8, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
