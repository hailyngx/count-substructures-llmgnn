Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (15, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (16, 4) (16, 6) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 12) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 13) (4, 3) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 16) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that form a 3-star pattern with their adjacent nodes.

Let's denote the 3-stars as <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (10, 18, 12)>
<2, (6, 14, 18)>
<3, (4, 5, 15)>
<4, (3, 5, 16)>
<5, (3, 4, 11)>
<6, (0, 2, 16)>
<8, (10, 12, 19)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<10, (1, 13, 18)>
<11, (5, 12, 13)>
<12, (8, 11, 18)>
<13, (10, 14, 18)>
<14, (2, 13, 19)>
<15, (3, 5, 16)>
<16, (4, 6, 15)>
<17, (19, 18, 2)>
<18, (1, 2, 19)>
<19, (8, 12, 14)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 9, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we get a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
