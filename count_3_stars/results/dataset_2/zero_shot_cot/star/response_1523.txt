Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 5:
   <5, (1, 3, 4)>

2. Node 9:
   <9, (1, 2, 13)>

3. Node 4:
   <4, (0, 5, 12)>

4. Node 7:
   <7, (0, 1, 10)>

5. Node 1:
   <1, (3, 5, 7)>
   <1, (9, 12, 14)>
   
6. Node 3:
   <3, (1, 5, 11)>
   
7. Node 8:
   <8, (3, 5, 13)>
   
8. Node 13:
   <13, (6, 9, 10)>

9. Node 12:
   <12, (4, 10, 1)>

10. Node 2:
   <2, (8, 9, 11)>

11. Node 11:
   <11, (2, 3, 6)>

12. Node 0:
   <0, (4, 6, 7)>

13. Node 10:
   <10, (0, 7, 12)>

14. Node 14:
   <14, (1, 5, 6)>

15. Node 6:
   <6, (0, 11, 13)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
