Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 13) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 16) (15, 6) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 6) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 18) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 16) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 0) (13, 19) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the node with degree 3:

Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 17, and 14.
Node 11 is connected to nodes 10 and 15.
Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 18.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 8.
Node 15 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 16.
Node 18 is connected to nodes 17, 19, and 9.
Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 0.
Node 19 is connected to nodes 18, 4, and 13.
Node 16 is connected to nodes 15, 2, and 6.
Node 14 is connected to nodes 10 and 8.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 12, 18, and 2.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 18.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 16, and 13.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 15 and 16.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 17, 7, and 12.
Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 4.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 19, and 0.
Node 13 is connected to nodes 19 and 2.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<10, (11, 17, 14)>
<11, (10, 15, 17)>
<17, (10, 18, 8)>
<7, (3, 15, 8)>
<15, (11, 7, 16)>
<18, (17, 19, 9)>
<12, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (2, 4, 0)>
<19, (18, 4, 13)>
<16, (15, 2, 6)>
<9, (12, 18, 2)>
<3, (7, 12, 18)>
<2, (5, 16, 13)>
<6, (15, 16)>
<8, (17, 7, 12)>
<0, (5, 18, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
