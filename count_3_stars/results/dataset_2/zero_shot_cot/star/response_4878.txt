Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 11) (15, 1) (15, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 19) (16, 14) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-stars:

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9 and 10
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 12
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 15 and 19
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 11, and 18
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 2, and 11
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 17, 11, and 2
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 17, 8, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 19, and 10
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 5, and 11
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1 and 13
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 10, and 18
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 17, 4, 7, and 19
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 14 and 18
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 0, and 16

Based on these connections, we can count the number of 3-stars:

1. Node 6: <6, (9, 10, X)>
2. Node 9: <9, (6, 19, 12)>
3. Node 1: <1, (15, 19, X)>
4. Node 14: <14, (17, 11, 18)>
5. Node 17: <17, (14, 2, 11)>
6. Node 7: <7, (17, 11, 2)>
7. Node 12: <12, (9, 13, 4)>
8. Node 2: <2, (17, 8, 7)>
9. Node 5: <5, (7, 19, 10)>
10. Node 19: <19, (9, 1, 11)>
11. Node 15: <15, (1, 13, X)>
12. Node 0: <0, (8, 12, 10)>
13. Node 11: <11, (14, 17, 4)>
14. Node 16: <16, (14, 18, X)>
15. Node 18: <18, (3, 14, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
