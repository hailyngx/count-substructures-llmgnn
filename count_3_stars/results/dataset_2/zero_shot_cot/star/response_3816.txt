Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 6 forms 4 3-stars: <6, (9, 3, 2)>, <6, (9, 8, 4)>, <6, (9, 4, 0)>, <6, (3, 1, 0)>.
2. Node 9 forms 3 3-stars: <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (6, 4, 0)>.
3. Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (3, 5, 4)>.
4. Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (6, 1, 0)>.
5. Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (6, 9, 1)>.
6. Node 8 forms 2 3-stars: <8, (9, 1, 3)>, <8, (9, 1, 4)>.
7. Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 2, 0)>.
8. Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (6, 8, 5)>.
9. Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (6, 9, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
