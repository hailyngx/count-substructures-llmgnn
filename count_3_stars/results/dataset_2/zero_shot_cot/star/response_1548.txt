Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Nodes with their corresponding connections:
- Node 0: (5, 0), (1, 0), (0, 2), (0, 6)
- Node 1: (7, 1), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 8)
- Node 2: (9, 2), (4, 2), (0, 2), (2, 0)
- Node 3: (4, 3), (7, 3), (1, 3), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 4)
- Node 4: (5, 4), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 7), (8, 5)
- Node 6: (3, 6), (8, 6), (0, 6), (6, 0)
- Node 7: (5, 7), (7, 3), (7, 1)
- Node 8: (5, 8), (9, 8), (4, 8), (7, 8), (1, 8), (3, 8), (8, 6), (8, 3)
- Node 9: (5, 9), (9, 8), (9, 2)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 8, 4)>
- <5, (8, 4, 0)>
- <5, (4, 0, 2)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <1, (7, 3, 8)>
- <3, (4, 8, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars present in the given graph.
