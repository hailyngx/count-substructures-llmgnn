Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 16) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 18) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 14) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 18) (6, 17) (16, 9) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 15, 8)>
<3, (15, 19, 18)>
<15, (9, 3, 8)>
<10, (7, 2, 12)>
<11, (0, 18, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 15)>
<13, (8, 17, 7)>
<2, (5, 10, 12)>
<0, (11, 12, 18)>
<14, (5, 18, 7)>
<1, (2, 17, 6)>
<17, (13, 6, 4)>
<7, (10, 13, 14)>
<4, (3, 17, 12)>
<12, (2, 0, 4)>
<18, (3, 11, 14)>
<19, (3, 4, 18)>
<6, (17, 1, 7)>
<16, (9, 14, 5)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: 20

So, the final answer is [20].
