Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-star structures. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 1 is the central node in the following 3-stars:
   <1, (11, 4, 5)>
   <1, (10, 2, 5)>

2. Node 3 is the central node in the following 3-star:
   <3, (11, 6, 13)>

3. Node 7 is the central node in the following 3-star:
   <7, (12, 9, 3)>

4. Node 12 is the central node in the following 3-stars:
   <12, (7, 5, 14)>
   <12, (14, 5, 7)>

5. Node 8 is the central node in the following 3-star:
   <8, (3, 9, 6)>

6. Node 9 is the central node in the following 3-star:
   <9, (11, 4, 0)>

7. Node 0 is the central node in the following 3-star:
   <0, (1, 9, 4)>

8. Node 10 is the central node in the following 3-star:
   <10, (1, 2, 13)>

9. Node 6 is the central node in the following 3-star:
   <6, (3, 8, 14)>

10. Node 14 is the central node in the following 3-star:
    <14, (12, 6, 8)>

11. Node 4 is the central node in the following 3-star:
    <4, (1, 11, 9)>

12. Node 2 is the central node in the following 3-star:
    <2, (11, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
