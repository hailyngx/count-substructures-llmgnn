Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are directly connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 5: (1, 2, 3)
2. Node 9: (4, 7, 8)
3. Node 6: (1, 2, 3)

Count of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 3)> <9, (4, 7, 8)> <6, (1, 2, 3)>
