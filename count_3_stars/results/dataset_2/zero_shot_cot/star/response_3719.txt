Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <4, (7, 1, 2)>
2. <7, (4, 0, 3)>
3. <1, (4, 7, 2)>
4. <3, (7, 1, 0)>
5. <6, (3, 9, 5)>
6. <9, (3, 6, -)>
7. <8, (4, 7, 5)>
8. <5, (7, 6, 8)>
9. <2, (4, 1, 5)>
10. <0, (7, 1, 3)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
