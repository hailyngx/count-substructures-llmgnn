Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 24) (8, 2) (8, 5) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 23) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 27) (28, 13) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 22) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 25) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 23) (26, 20) (26, 3) (26, 12) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 27) (13, 28) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 29) (20, 2) (20, 26) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 15) (1, 29) (1, 6) (1, 25) (6, 1) (14, 13) (14, 23) (14, 19) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 14) (15, 29) (15, 16) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 5) (3, 26) (3, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 16) (25, 22) (25, 1) (16, 15) (16, 18) (12, 26) (23, 21) (23, 24) (23, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three neighbors. 

The total number of 3-stars is [12]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (2, 7, 17)>
<7, (0, 4, 17)>
<10, (11, 17, 19)>
<11, (9, 10, 18)>
<17, (4, 7, 10)>
<2, (4, 8, 19)>
<8, (2, 5, 27)>
<21, (0, 23, 28)>
<28, (13, 21, 27)>
<9, (11, 17, 22)>
<22, (9, 25, 27)>
<13, (14, 28, 21)>
