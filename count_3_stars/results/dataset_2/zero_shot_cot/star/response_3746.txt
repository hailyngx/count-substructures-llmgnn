Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 6) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (3, 11) (3, 0) (15, 10) (15, 14) (13, 17) (13, 14) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 5) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 10) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 1) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (14, 19) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (5, 16) (5, 17) (5, 1) 

Response:
Let's count the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 11: (16, 3, 18)
- Node 8: (16, 2, 19)
- Node 5: (16, 17, 1)
- Node 6: (2, 18, 5)
- Node 14: (18, 15, 13)
- Node 10: (15, 0, 12)
- Node 4: (19, 10, 9)
- Node 1: (0, 4, 5)

2. List the unique 3-stars:
<11, (16, 3, 18)>
<8, (16, 2, 19)>
<5, (16, 17, 1)>
<6, (2, 18, 5)>
<14, (18, 15, 13)>
<10, (15, 0, 12)>
<4, (19, 10, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [8]
