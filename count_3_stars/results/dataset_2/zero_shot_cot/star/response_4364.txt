Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<6, (10, 3, 11)>
<6, (10, 11, 13)>
<6, (3, 11, 13)>
<9, (14, 10, 7)>
<9, (14, 10, 13)>
<4, (8, 1, 11)>
<8, (4, 11, 0)>
<8, (11, 0, 1)>
<8, (11, 0, 7)>
<8, (11, 1, 7)>
<5, (12, 3, 0)>
<13, (6, 9, 2)>
<3, (6, 5, 11)>
<3, (6, 7, 0)>
<3, (11, 7, 12)>
<11, (6, 4, 8)>
<0, (8, 5, 3)>
<7, (9, 8, 3)>
<12, (5, 3, 11)>
<1, (4, 8, 14)>
<14, (9, 11, 2)>
<2, (13, 14, 10)>

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in the graph.
