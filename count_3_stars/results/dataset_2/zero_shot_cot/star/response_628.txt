Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given graph information:
- 10 nodes
- 40 edges

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's proceed with identifying all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
