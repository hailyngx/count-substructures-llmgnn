Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 18) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 18) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 3) (3, 5) (3, 17) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for central nodes that have exactly three neighboring nodes.

We can identify the 3-stars using the following steps:
1. List all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, list the unique set of three neighboring nodes connected to it.
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.

Here are the unique 3-stars identified in the given graph:
<2, (8, 12, 17)>
<8, (2, 10, 15)>
<12, (2, 11, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
