Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <0, (1, 3, 7)>
2. Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 7: <4, (5, 1, 7)>
3. Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 6, 2, and 0: <8, (6, 2, 0)>
4. Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 0: <9, (5, 7, 0)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the graph.
