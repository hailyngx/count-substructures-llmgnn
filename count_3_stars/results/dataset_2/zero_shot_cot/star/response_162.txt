Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. Let's count them step by step:

1. Node 5 has 4 edges: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3). <5, (9, 4, 0)>
2. Node 9 has 4 edges: (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1). <9, (5, 6, 2)>
3. Node 6 has 5 edges: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0). <6, (9, 7, 8)>
4. Node 4 has 6 edges: (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2). <4, (5, 6, 8)>
5. Node 8 has 2 edges: (8, 6) (8, 4). <8, (6, 4)>
6. Node 0 has 4 edges: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7). <0, (5, 6, 2)>
7. Node 2 has 5 edges: (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3). <2, (9, 4, 0)>
8. Node 7 has 3 edges: (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1). <7, (6, 0, 1)>
9. Node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7). <1, (9, 4, 2)>
10. Node 3 has 3 edges: (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2). <3, (5, 4, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
