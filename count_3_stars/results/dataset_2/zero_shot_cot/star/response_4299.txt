Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 9) (7, 13) (21, 11) (12, 25) (12, 15) (12, 26) (27, 24) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 18) (28, 6) (28, 10) (13, 7) (13, 26) (13, 1) (26, 12) (26, 5) (26, 13) (4, 15) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 25) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 15) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 23) (29, 22) (29, 3) (2, 23) (2, 14) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 25) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 8) (10, 28) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 25) (11, 21) (11, 24) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 14) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 8) (3, 5) (3, 29) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 2) (14, 24) (14, 3) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 15) (20, 23) (23, 16) (23, 9) (23, 2) (23, 20) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 22) (25, 10) (8, 0) (8, 18) (8, 17) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 17) 

Response:
Based on the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (1, 8, 10)>
<1, (0, 9, 13)>
<2, (14, 22, 23)>
<3, (0, 5, 29)>
<4, (15, 12, 16)>
<5, (3, 6, 26)>
<6, (5, 10, 28)>
<7, (9, 13, 24)>
<8, (0, 17, 18)>
<9, (1, 7, 23)>
<10, (0, 6, 25)>
<11, (21, 24, 27)>
<12, (4, 15, 25)>
<13, (1, 7, 26)>
<14, (2, 3, 24)>
<15, (4, 15, 17)>
<16, (4, 15, 22)>
<17, (8, 15, 16)>
<18, (5, 8, 19)>
<19, (18, 22, 25)>
<20, (23, 22, 16)>
<21, (11, 24, 27)>
<22, (19, 16, 25)>
<23, (2, 9, 20)>
<24, (7, 11, 14)>
<25, (12, 19, 22)>
<26, (5, 13, 26)>
<27, (11, 21, 24)>
<28, (6, 10, 26)>
<29, (3, 22, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].
