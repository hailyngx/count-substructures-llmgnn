Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 7) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 5) (7, 18) (7, 26) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 19) (21, 26) (20, 12) (20, 16) (25, 29) (25, 15) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 12) (29, 25) (29, 5) (29, 3) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 1) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 14) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 26) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (23, 26) (23, 13) (8, 11) (19, 18) (19, 21) (10, 21) (10, 1) (16, 22) (16, 20) (16, 4) (16, 2) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 14) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 17) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 13) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 26) (12, 20) (12, 28) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 2) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 23) (13, 24) (13, 15) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node by exactly three edges each. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars. 
Upon examining the given edge list, we find the following nodes connected to the center node (corresponding to node 27):

- Node 4: (27, 4), (4, 27), (4, 24), (4, 22), (4, 16)
- Node 24: (27, 24), (24, 27), (24, 4), (24, 6), (24, 13)

Next, we can identify the 3-stars:

<27, (4, 24, 6)>
<27, (4, 24, 13)>

Finally, we count the total number of 3-stars:
