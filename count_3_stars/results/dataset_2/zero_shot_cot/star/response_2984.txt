Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 6) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 15) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (1, 26) (1, 2) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 22) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 27) (26, 4) (21, 8) (21, 18) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 23) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 4) (13, 15) (13, 28) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (25, 5) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 2) (27, 26) (27, 25) (27, 23) (19, 14) (19, 12) (22, 17) (22, 14) (22, 0) (29, 10) (29, 25) (29, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 25) (7, 15) (7, 29) (7, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 22) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (20, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 26) (4, 5) (0, 22) (0, 12) (0, 8) (18, 21) (18, 13) (18, 20) (23, 28) (23, 27) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 25)>
<3, (6, 14, 15)>
<4, (5, 26, 26)>
<5, (2, 4, 25)>
<6, (3, 11, 14)>
<7, (9, 15, 29)>
<8, (0, 11, 21)>
<9, (7, 12, 16)>
<10, (17, 26, 29)>
<11, (6, 8, 16)>
<12, (0, 8, 9)>
<13, (5, 18, 28)>
<14, (3, 6, 22)>
<15, (13, 16, 28)>
<16, (3, 9, 15)>
<17, (10, 22, 26)>
<18, (13, 20, 21)>
<19, (12, 14, 19)>
<20, (18, 19, 21)>
<21, (18, 8, 20)>
<22, (14, 17, 0)>
<23, (23, 27>
<25, (2, 5, 27)>
<26, (4, 10, 27)>
<27, (23, 25, 26)>
<28, (13, 15, 23)>
<29, (7, 10, 25)>
<0, (8, 12, 22)>

There are a total of [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
