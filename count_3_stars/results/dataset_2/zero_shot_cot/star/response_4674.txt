Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
1: 6, 3, 4
2: 5, 9, 4, 7
3: 5, 1, 0
4: 5, 1, 8, 0, 2
5: 6, 2, 4, 3, 7
6: 5, 1, 7, 8, 0
7: 5, 6, 8, 0, 2
8: 9, 6, 4, 7
9: 8, 2

Nodes 1, 3, and 9 do not have exactly three neighbors, so they cannot be the centers of 3-stars.
Nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8 have exactly three neighbors, so they can each be the center of a 3-star.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
