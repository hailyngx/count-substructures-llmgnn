Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 8) (6, 24) (6, 17) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 28) (7, 8) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 20) (11, 4) (11, 13) (20, 10) (20, 1) (20, 12) (25, 27) (25, 2) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 27) (12, 28) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 9) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 24) (14, 21) (22, 9) (22, 28) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 2) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 28) (19, 1) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 23) (15, 1) (21, 10) (21, 14) (21, 13) (21, 16) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 2) (24, 23) (16, 21) (29, 1) (29, 8) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 2) (3, 27) (3, 17) (2, 26) (2, 25) (2, 13) (2, 24) (2, 17) (23, 27) (23, 1) (23, 24) (8, 26) (8, 7) (8, 29) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 22) (28, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes with edges. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 19.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 20, 15, and 29.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 26, 25, and 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 12, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 26, 7, and 29.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 20, and 27.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 11, 5, and 21.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 10, 5, and 28.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 16.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 6, 27, and 14.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 25, 12, and 3.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 22.

2. List all unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 10, 19)>
<1, (20, 15, 29)>
<2, (26, 25, 13)>
<4, (6, 12, 14)>
<8, (26, 7, 29)>
<12, (4, 20, 27)>
<13, (11, 5, 21)>
<19, (10, 5, 28)>
<21, (10, 14, 16)>
<24, (6, 27, 14)>
<27, (25, 12, 3)>
<28, (7, 12, 22)>

3. Count the number of 3-stars: 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
