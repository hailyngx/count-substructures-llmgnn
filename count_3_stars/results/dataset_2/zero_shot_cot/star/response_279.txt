Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (17, 12) (17, 4) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 16) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 6) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 16) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 1) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 15) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three neighboring nodes for each 3-star.

Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <2, (0, 6, 13)>
2. <4, (11, 15, 17)>
3. <5, (1, 10, 13)>
4. <7, (3, 9, 14)>
5. <9, (0, 7, 15)>
6. <10, (5, 16, 19)>
7. <11, (2, 4, 18)>
8. <12, (0, 1, 2)>
9. <13, (1, 2, 5)>
10. <15, (4, 9, 11)>
11. <16, (7, 10, 14)>
12. <18, (4, 11, 18)>

Therefore, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
