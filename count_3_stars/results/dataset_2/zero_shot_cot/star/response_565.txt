Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

There are a total of 4 distinct 3-stars in this graph:
<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<4, (7, 0, 3)>
<8, (9, 7, 1)>

Now, we count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
