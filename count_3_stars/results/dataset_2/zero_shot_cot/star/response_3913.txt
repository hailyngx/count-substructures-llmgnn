Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors (leaves) connected to it. Let's list the unique 3-stars one by one:

<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4]
