Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. Since a 3-star has one central node and three leaves connected to it, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

- Node 5 has 3 edges: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1)
- Node 9 has 4 edges: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 7)
- Node 4 has 6 edges: (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 2)
- Node 7 has 2 edges: (7, 9), (7, 4)
- Node 6 has 4 edges: (6, 9), (6, 4), (6, 2), (6, 0)
- Node 8 has 4 edges: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 1)
- Node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 0)
- Node 3 has 5 edges: (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 0), (3, 2)
- Node 2 has 4 edges: (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 3)
- Node 0 has 4 edges: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 3)

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
<6, (9, 2, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 0)>
<3, (9, 0, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
