Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find possible 3-stars based on the given edges:

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 2)
   <0, (5, 4, 7)>
   <0, (5, 4, 8)>
   <0, (5, 4, 2)>
   
2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2)
   <1, (3, 6, 2)>
   
3. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 0)
   
4. Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2)
   <3, (4, 7, 1)>
   
5. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 3)
   <4, (5, 0, 6)>
   <4, (5, 0, 3)>
   
6. Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 0)

7. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 2)
   
8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 8)
   <7, (0, 3, 2)>
   
9. Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 7), (8, 0), (8, 6)
   
10. Node 9: (9, 8), (9, 2)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<0, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<4, (5, 0, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 2)>
