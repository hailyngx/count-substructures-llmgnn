Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 16) (6, 22) (6, 19) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 20) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 19) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 13) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 8) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 26) (2, 1) (8, 27) (8, 25) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 28) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 12) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 25) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 24) (23, 14) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 24) (16, 21) (16, 7) (16, 29) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 26) (22, 6) (7, 27) (7, 16) (10, 3) (10, 23) (10, 26) (26, 0) (26, 4) (26, 10) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 16) (29, 4) (20, 1) (20, 9) (20, 13) (20, 5) (5, 20) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 23) (24, 27) (24, 3) (24, 13) (24, 23) (12, 28) (12, 25) (25, 0) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is the center, connected to nodes 2, 4, and 20. <1, (2, 4, 20)>
2. Node 6 is the center, connected to nodes 19, 22, and 28. <6, (19, 22, 28)>
3. Node 9 is the center, connected to nodes 17, 20, and 28. <9, (17, 20, 28)>
4. Node 14 is the center, connected to nodes 17, 19, and 23. <14, (17, 19, 23)>
5. Node 27 is the center, connected to nodes 7, 8, and 15. <27, (7, 8, 15)>
6. Node 11 is the center, connected to nodes 3, 18, and 23. <11, (3, 18, 23)>
7. Node 16 is the center, connected to nodes 7, 21, and 29. <16, (7, 21, 29)>
8. Node 26 is the center, connected to nodes 0, 4, and 10. <26, (0, 4, 10)>
9. Node 25 is the center, connected to nodes 0, 8, and 12. <25, (0, 8, 12)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
