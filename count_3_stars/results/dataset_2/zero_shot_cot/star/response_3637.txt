Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes with three edges connected to them.

After examining the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars based on the edges provided:
1. <5, (9, 6, 8)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 4)>
3. <6, (9, 5, 7)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 0)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 3)>
6. <7, (6, 1, 8)>
7. <2, (9, 6, 8)>
8. <8, (5, 6, 7)>
9. <0, (9, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
