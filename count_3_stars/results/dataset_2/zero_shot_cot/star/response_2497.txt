Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (2, 12, 6)>
<2, (1, 10, 14)>
<3, (0, 8, 5)>
<4, (14, 0, 2)>
<5, (7, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 8, 11)>
<7, (11, 5, 10)>
<8, (6, 1, 13)>
<10, (7, 11, 12)>
<11, (1, 7, 6)>
<12, (1, 10, 0)>
<13, (8, 6, 2)>
<14, (4, 2, 9)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars is [13].
