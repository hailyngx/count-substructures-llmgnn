Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 15) (14, 4) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (9, 10) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star in this graph can have degree 3. Using the provided information, let's find the 3-stars:

- We can see that node 2 has degree 4, which means it cannot be a central node of a 3-star.
- Similarly, node 5 has degree 4, so it cannot be a central node either.
- Nodes 4, 6, 9, 12, 14, 1, 0, 13 have degrees less than 3, so they cannot be central nodes.
- Nodes 10, 7, 11, 17, 18, 19, 3 can potentially be central nodes since they have degree 3.
- Now, let's check the neighbors of these potential central nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<7, (13, 10, 12)>
<11, (0, 15, 19)>
<17, (2, 6, 1)>
<18, (2, 4, 15)>
<19, (4, 7, 11)>
<3, (8, 5, 0)>

Counting the 3-stars: [6]
