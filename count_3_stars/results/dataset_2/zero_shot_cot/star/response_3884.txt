Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 1) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
- Central node: 5, Leaves: 9, 13, 2 (3-star: <5, (9, 13, 2)>)
- Central node: 4, Leaves: 7, 12, 13 (3-star: <4, (7, 12, 13)>)
- Central node: 2, Leaves: 5, 8, 6 (3-star: <2, (5, 8, 6)>)
- Central node: 8, Leaves: 5, 2, 10 (3-star: <8, (5, 2, 10)>)
- Central node: 3, Leaves: 2, 10, 12 (3-star: <3, (2, 10, 12)>)
- Central node: 11, Leaves: 4, 2, 0 (3-star: <11, (4, 2, 0)>)
- Central node: 13, Leaves: 5, 4, 7 (3-star: <13, (5, 4, 7)>)
- Central node: 12, Leaves: 4, 3, 11 (3-star: <12, (4, 3, 11)>)
- Central node: 0, Leaves: 9, 8, 11 (3-star: <0, (9, 8, 11)>)
- Central node: 10, Leaves: 8, 3, 0 (3-star: <10, (8, 3, 0)>)
- Central node: 6, Leaves: 7, 2 (6 does not form a 3-star structure)
- Central node: 1, Leaves: 4, 8, 10 (1 does not form a 3-star structure)
- Central node: 14, Leaves: 5, 7, 2, 1 (14 does not form a 3-star structure)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
