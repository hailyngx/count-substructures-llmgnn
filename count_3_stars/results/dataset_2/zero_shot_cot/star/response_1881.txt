Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 10, 14)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (8, 7, 14)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (5, 8, 7)>
<5, (4, 8, 11)>
<6, (1, 3, 13)>
<7, (5, 9, 11)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<9, (5, 10, 7)>
<10, (9, 0, 14)>
<11, (5, 9, 7)>
<12, (3, 13, 14)>
<13, (12, 1, 6)>
<14, (10, 12, 2)>

There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
