Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (9, 4, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 7)>
<8, (9, 6, 3)>
<0, (7, 2, 1)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>
<1, (5, 4, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
