Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 1: (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 5)
- Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 0)

2. For each node found in step 1, create a 3-star:

<1, (8, 9, 2)>
<1, (9, 8, 5)>
<1, (2, 8, 5)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<1, (7, 9, 5)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (7, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 4, 3)>
<5, (4, 8, 1)>
<5, (8, 4, 3)>
<5, (1, 8, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (7, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 4, 2)>
<5, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [17]
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (8, 9, 2)>
<1, (9, 8, 5)>
<1, (2, 8, 5)>
<1, (5, 8, 7)>
<1, (7, 9, 5)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 9, 5)>
<3, (7, 4, 5)>
<3, (5, 4, 3)>
<5, (4, 8, 1)>
<5, (8, 4, 3)>
<5, (1, 8, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (7, 1, 3)>
<5, (0, 4, 2)>
<5, (0, 8, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
