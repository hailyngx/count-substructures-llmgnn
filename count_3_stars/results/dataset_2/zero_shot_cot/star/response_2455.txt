Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will form the centers of 3-stars.

1. Node 4: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6)
   <4, (7, 9, 3)> 

2. Node 7: (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5)
   <7, (4, 3, 6)>

3. Node 3: (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2)
   <3, (4, 7, 6)>

4. Node 6: (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8)
   <6, (4, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
