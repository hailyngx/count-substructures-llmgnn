Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (13, 8) (10, 17) (10, 19) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 16) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the information provided and count the number of occurrences. 

1. (3, 8, 15)
2. (2, 15, 17)
3. (17, 10, 19)
4. (8, 5, 2)
5. (8, 6, 19)
6. (0, 11, 14)
7. (0, 9, 12)
8. (1, 4, 16)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (4, 16, 1)>, <2, (17, 15, 2)>, <3, (8, 15, 3)>, <6, (11, 14, 0)>, <7, (12, 9, 0)>, <8, (15, 3, 8)>, <11, (17, 10, 19)>, <13, (5, 8, 2)>.
