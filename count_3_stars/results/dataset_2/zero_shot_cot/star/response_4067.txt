Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this graph. 
Let's list them step-by-step:

1. First, let's identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 9, 4, 7, 3
   - Node 0 has neighbors: 9, 3, 8, 2

2. Next, let's identify 3-stars based on the nodes with 3 neighbors:
   - Node 1 as the center:
     - <1, (5, 9, 4)>
     - <1, (5, 9, 7)>
     - <1, (5, 9, 3)>
     - <1, (9, 4, 7)>
     - <1, (9, 4, 1)>
     - <1, (9, 7, 4)>
     - <1, (9, 7, 3)>
     - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
     - <1, (7, 4, 8)>
     [Total: 9]

   - Node 0 as the center:
     - <0, (9, 3, 8)>
     [Total: 1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
