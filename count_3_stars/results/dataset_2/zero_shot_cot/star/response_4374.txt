Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 16) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 18) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 18) (16, 9) (16, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Nodes with exactly 3 edges are potential central nodes.

The potential central nodes are: 3, 6, 9, 4, 7, 10, 12, 0, 19, 17, 8, and 13.

Next, for each potential central node, let's identify the neighboring nodes that form 3-stars with the central node.

1. For central node 3:
<3, (11, 13, 17)>

2. For central node 6:
<6, (4, 15, 19)>

3. For central node 9:
<9, (3, 16, -)>

4. For central node 4:
<4, (6, 13, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 13)>

5. For central node 7:
<7, (4, 18, -)>

6. For central node 10:
<10, (0, 18, 19)>

7. For central node 12:
<12, (0, 1, 5)>
<12, (2, 1, 12)>

8. For central node 0:
<0, (1, 10, 12)>

9. For central node 19:
<19, (4, 6, 10)>

10. For central node 17:
<17, (0, 3, -)>

11. For central node 8:
<8, (15, 16, 18)>

12. For central node 13:
<13, (3, 4, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
