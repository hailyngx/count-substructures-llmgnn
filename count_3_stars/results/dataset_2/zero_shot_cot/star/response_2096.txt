Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 5) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 7) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 8) (12, 13) (12, 1) (14, 3) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 15) (17, 9) (17, 3) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star and count them. 

Let's find the 3-stars step by step:
1. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Check if the connections form a 3-star pattern with the selected node as the center and three connected nodes as the leaves.

<11, (10, 8, 15)>
<16, (7, 2, 6)>
<10, (11, 7, 5)>
<2, (16, 18, 9)>
<18, (2, 4, 15)>
<4, (18, 19, 0)>
<5, (10, 13, 0)>
<13, (5, 12, 0)>
<1, (6, 12, 0)>
<15, (11, 18, 17)>
<8, (11, 9, 0)>
<9, (2, 8, 17)>
<6, (16, 1, 8)>
<12, (13, 1, 0)>
<14, (3, 19, 0)>
<7, (16, 10, 9)>
<3, (4, 14, 17)>
<17, (15, 9, 3)>
<19, (10, 4, 3)>
<0, (4, 13, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [20]
