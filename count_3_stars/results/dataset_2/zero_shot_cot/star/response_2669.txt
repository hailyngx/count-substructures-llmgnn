Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 16) (27, 5) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 24) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 22) (17, 26) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 16) (2, 18) (2, 23) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 12) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 23) (29, 7) (29, 0) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 21) (22, 17) (22, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 26) (12, 14) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 21) (19, 10) (10, 19) (26, 17) (26, 20) (26, 6) (11, 6) (11, 24) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 25) (0, 29) (0, 9) (0, 23) (7, 29) (7, 22) (7, 19) (7, 28) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 19) (23, 2) (23, 18) (23, 20) (23, 0) (16, 27) (16, 13) (16, 4) (28, 7) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 25) (25, 24) (25, 28) (4, 16) (4, 28) (5, 27) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node by exactly three edges to form 3-stars.

The nodes with 3 connections are:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 27, 14, 7)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 14, 8, 21)
- Node 18 (connected to nodes 3, 2, 12)
- Node 24 (connected to nodes 27, 14, 11)
- Node 28 (connected to nodes 7, 4, 5)

Next, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (27, 14, 7)>
<13, (14, 8, 21)>
<18, (3, 2, 12)>
<24, (27, 14, 11)>
<28, (7, 4, 5)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [5].
