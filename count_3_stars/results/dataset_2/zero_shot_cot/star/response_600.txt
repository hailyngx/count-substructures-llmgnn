Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 9) (27, 13) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 23) (18, 20) (18, 28) (22, 1) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (17, 3) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 8) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 5) (29, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 12) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 2) (1, 22) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 7) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 2) (10, 15) (10, 3) (11, 29) (11, 23) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 12) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 13) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 7) (13, 21) (21, 13) (2, 14) (2, 28) (2, 24) (2, 23) (12, 3) (12, 26) (12, 23) (20, 18) (20, 23) (8, 3) (8, 17) (16, 14) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 5) (19, 24) (19, 7) (19, 16) (5, 29) (5, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

Let's find the 3-stars:
1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (17, 7, 16)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (14, 28, 24)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (17, 10, 8)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 28, 0)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (29, 1, 19)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (27, 6, 23)>
7. Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (3, 26, 23)>
8. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (27, 29, 7)>
9. Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (15, 6, 0)>
10. Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (27, 10, 26)>
11. Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (14, 1, 19)>
12. Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (3, 1, 8)>
13. Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (24, 16, 7)>
14. Node 20 forms a 3-star: <20, (18, 23, 0)>
15. Node 23 forms a 3-star: <23, (9, 20, 12)>
16. Node 24 forms a 3-star: <24, (26, 2, 19)>
17. Node 26 forms a 3-star: <26, (15, 24, 12)>
18. Node 27 forms a 3-star: <27, (15, 9, 13)>
19. Node 28 forms a 3-star: <28, (27, 6, 2)>
20. Node 29 forms a 3-star: <29, (17, 11, 5)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
