Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node. 

Node 0 is connected to: 2, 9, 10, 6

Node 1 is connected to: 7, 12, 10

Node 2 is connected to: 8, 10, 11, 0

Node 3 is connected to: 8, 7, 9

Node 4 is connected to: 8, 9, 14, 11

Node 5 is connected to: 8, 11, 10

Node 6 is connected to: 8, 13, 0

Node 7 is connected to: 12, 3, 11, 14, 1

Node 8 is connected to: 4, 2, 9, 5, 6, 3

Node 9 is connected to: 4, 8, 13, 3, 0

Node 10 is connected to: 2, 5, 0, 1

Node 11 is connected to: 4, 7, 2, 5, 14

Node 12 is connected to: 7, 13, 1

Node 13 is connected to: 12, 9, 14, 6

Node 14 is connected to: 4, 7, 13, 11

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 9, 10)>
<1, (12, 7, 10)>
<2, (8, 10, 11)>
<3, (8, 9, 7)>
<4, (8, 9, 14)>
<5, (8, 11, 10)>
<6, (8, 13, 0)>
<7, (12, 3, 11)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 13)>
<10, (2, 5, 0)>
<11, (4, 7, 2)>
<12, (7, 13, 1)>
<13, (12, 9, 14)>
<14, (4, 7, 13)>

Therefore, there are [14] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
