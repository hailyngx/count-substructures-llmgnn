Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes in the graph:

1. Central nodes:
   - Node 6 has 6 adjacent nodes: 9, 5, 1, 7, 4, 0
   - Node 9 has 3 adjacent nodes: 6, 2, 3
   - Node 4 has 5 adjacent nodes: 6, 8, 5, 3, 2
   - Node 8 has 3 adjacent nodes: 4, 0, 7
   - Node 5 has 4 adjacent nodes: 6, 4, 2, 1
   - Node 0 has 4 adjacent nodes: 6, 8, 2, 1
   - Node 2 has 6 adjacent nodes: 9, 4, 5, 0, 1, 3
   - Node 7 has 2 adjacent nodes: 6, 8
   - Node 1 has 4 adjacent nodes: 6, 5, 0, 2
   - Node 3 has 3 adjacent nodes: 9, 4, 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 6 can form three 3-stars with its adjacent nodes: <6, (9, 5, 1)>, <6, (7, 8, 4)>, <6, (0, 5, 1)>
- Node 9 can form one 3-star with its adjacent nodes: <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 4 can form one 3-star with its adjacent nodes: <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- Node 8 can form one 3-star with its adjacent nodes: <8, (0, 7, 4)>
- Node 5 can form one 3-star with its adjacent nodes: <5, (2, 1, 4)>
- Node 0 can form one 3-star with its adjacent nodes: <0, (2, 1, 6)>
- Node 2 can form three 3-stars with its adjacent nodes: <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8.
So, the answer is [8].
