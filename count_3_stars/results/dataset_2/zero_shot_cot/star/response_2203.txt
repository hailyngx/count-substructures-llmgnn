Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 3) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 2) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 2, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13
Node 1: 4, 9, 13
Node 2: 0, 9, 14
Node 3: 5, 6, 8, 10, 11
Node 4: 1, 5, 9, 12, 13, 14
Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6
Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 11, 14
Node 7: 0, 9, 13
Node 8: 3, 11, 12
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 7, 13
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 0, 3, 6, 8
Node 12: 4, 8, 13, 14
Node 13: 0, 1, 4, 7, 9, 12
Node 14: 2, 4, 6, 12

Next, let's identify the 3-star configurations:

<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 13)>
<0, (5, 7, 13)>
<0, (6, 7, 13)>
<3, (5, 6, 11)>
<3, (5, 8, 11)>
<4, (1, 9, 13)>
<4, (5, 9, 12)>
<4, (9, 12, 13)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 11)>
<6, (0, 5, 13)>
<6, (3, 5, 11)>
<6, (4, 12, 14)>
<9, (1, 4, 13)>
<9, (4, 7, 13)>
<9, (4, 9, 13)>
<9, (7, 9, 13)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 19. 
Therefore, the answer is [19].
