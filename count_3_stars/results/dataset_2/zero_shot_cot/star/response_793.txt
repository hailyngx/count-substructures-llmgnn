Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 11) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 12) (2, 22) (2, 3) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 10) (3, 2) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 11) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 4) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 28) (12, 13) (12, 22) (12, 27) (12, 15) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 16) (6, 21) (6, 23) (28, 18) (28, 16) (28, 24) (4, 25) (4, 18) (4, 14) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 5) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 15) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 0) (7, 29) (7, 25) (7, 27) (7, 1) (7, 10) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 8) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 19) (16, 27) (16, 28) (0, 21) (10, 29) (10, 7) (5, 25) (5, 26) (5, 17) (9, 24) (9, 19) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 15) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 24) (14, 4) (8, 29) (8, 12) (8, 11) (20, 23) (20, 19) (19, 23) (19, 9) (19, 20) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<3, (2, 25, 11)>
<7, (29, 25, 1)>
<12, (13, 22, 27)>
<17, (1, 5, 15)>
<19, (23, 20, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
