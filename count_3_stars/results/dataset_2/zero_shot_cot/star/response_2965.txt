Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 6) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 4) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 10) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 5:
- <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- <5, (4, 9, 8)>

2. Node 9:
- <9, (5, 11, 3)>
- <9, (12, 8, 5)>

3. Node 8:
- <8, (5, 13, 0)>
- <8, (6, 12, 8)>

4. Node 13:
- <13, (8, 4, 14)>
- <13, (7, 8, 4)>

5. Node 7:
- <7, (13, 0, 6)>
- <7, (10, 6, 13)>

6. Node 12:
- <12, (8, 10, 9)>
- <12, (1, 12, 8)>

7. Node 2:
- <2, (5, 0, 15)>

8. Node 0:
- <0, (8, 7, 14)>
- <0, (2, 1, 5)>

9. Node 14:
- <14, (13, 11, 6)>
- <14, (0, 11, 13)>

10. Node 3:
- <3, (9, 11, 4)>
- <3, (6, 4, 9)>

11. Node 11:
- <11, (9, 14, 3)>
- <11, (6, 3, 14)>

12. Node 1:
- <1, (12, 0, 6)>

13. Node 6:
- <6, (8, 7, 14)>
- <6, (3, 1, 11)>
- <6, (0, 7, 10)>

14. Node 10:
- <10, (7, 12, 4)>
- <10, (4, 13, 7)>

15. Node 4:
- <4, (5, 13, 3)>
- <4, (10, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
