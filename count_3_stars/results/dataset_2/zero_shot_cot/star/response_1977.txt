Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (9, 6, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 3)>
<6, (9, 6, 0)>
<7, (1, 5, 0)>
