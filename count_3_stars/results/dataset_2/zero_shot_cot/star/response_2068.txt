Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 7) (8, 11) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. There are two 3-stars with center node 5:
   <5, (9, 6, 2)>
   <5, (6, 2, 1)>

2. There are no 3-stars with center node 9.

3. There is one 3-star with center node 4:
   <4, (7, 10, 14)>

4. There is one 3-star with center node 7:
   <7, (6, 10, 1)>

5. There are no 3-stars with center node 6.

6. There is one 3-star with center node 10:
   <10, (7, 11, 2)>

7. There is one 3-star with center node 11:
   <11, (9, 10, 14)>

8. There is one 3-star with center node 0:
   <0, (3, 12, 1)>

9. There is one 3-star with center node 14:
   <14, (6, 11, 13)>

10. There are no 3-stars with center node 8.

11. There are no 3-stars with center node 2.

12. There are no 3-stars with center node 12.

13. There is one 3-star with center node 3:
    <3, (9, 0, 2)>

14. There is one 3-star with center node 13:
    <13, (6, 14, 1)>

15. There is one 3-star with center node 1:
    <1, (7, 0, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
