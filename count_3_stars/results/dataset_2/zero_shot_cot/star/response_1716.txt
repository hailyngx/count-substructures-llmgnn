Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each possible 3-star by checking all nodes connected to each node. 

From the provided edge list, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 0, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 0, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
