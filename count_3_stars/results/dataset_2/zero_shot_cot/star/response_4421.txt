Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 0) (26, 18) (26, 6) (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 29) (21, 15) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 20) (3, 16) (8, 5) (8, 27) (8, 22) (13, 7) (13, 6) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 23) (27, 8) (27, 12) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 18) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 24) (11, 15) (28, 17) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 23) (18, 5) (19, 23) (19, 22) (19, 15) (23, 12) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 20) (25, 23) (25, 5) (25, 16) (6, 26) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 16) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 24) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 25) (2, 10) (2, 24) (17, 0) (17, 28) (16, 3) (16, 25) (16, 22) (16, 4) (29, 21) (29, 4) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 4) (20, 10) (10, 2) (10, 20) (4, 16) (4, 29) (4, 20) (24, 14) (24, 15) (24, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will represent potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes with degree 3 are:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 21, 3, and 14)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 8, 18, and 25)

Now, let's check all the neighboring nodes of nodes 1 and 5 to see if they form a 3-star structure.

For Node 1:
- For node 1 (center), the 3-star is <1, (21, 3, 14)>
- For node 3 (center), the 3-star is <3, (9, 1, 20)>

For Node 5:
- For node 5 (center), the 3-star is <5, (8, 18, 25)>
- For node 8 (center), the 3-star is <8, (5, 27, 22)>
- For node 25 (center), the 3-star is <25, (5, 23, 16)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [5] 
These are the unique 3-stars: <<1, (21, 3, 14)>, <3, (9, 1, 20)>, <5, (8, 18, 25)>, <8, (5, 27, 22)>, <25, (5, 23, 16)>]
