Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 19) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 2) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 6) (12, 15) (12, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 16) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

We will list out all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 0.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 16.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 0.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 8.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 13.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 10, 15, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 19, 13, and 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 15, and 0.

From the above connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<1, (3, 15, 13)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<4, (5, 9, 18)>
<18, (1, 4, 16)>
<15, (1, 0, 12)>
<7, (3, 11, 0)>
<16, (5, 12, 8)>
<14, (5, 10, 13)>
<19, (10, 15, 6)>
<6, (19, 13, 0)>
<2, (5, 15, 0)>

Count of 3-stars = 12

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
