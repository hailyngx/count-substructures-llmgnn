Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 9) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 18) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (7, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (12, 16) (12, 10) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) (15, 17) (15, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 18.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 17.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 16, and 19.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 16, and 18.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 17, 19, and 15.

Now we can find the 3-star configurations:
<1, (3, 4, 18)>
<3, (1, 4, 18)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (10, 14, 17)>
<6, (4, 9, 18)>
<8, (13, 16, 19)>
<10, (5, 12, 14)>
<12, (10, 16, 18)>
<13, (8, 18, 2)>
<15, (17, 19, 15)>
<16, (8, 12, 16)>
<17, (1, 5, 15)>
<18, (3, 6, 12)>
<19, (8, 10, 15)>

So we have found 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
