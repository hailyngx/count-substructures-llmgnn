Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 22) (7, 14) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 26) (8, 5) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 27) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 6) (22, 17) (22, 12) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 0) (0, 7) (0, 23) (0, 20) (0, 15) (0, 1) (20, 0) (20, 12) (20, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 29) (3, 17) (3, 21) (3, 1) (28, 8) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 25) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 18) (19, 9) (19, 4) (4, 19) (27, 8) (27, 11) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 24) (16, 10) (11, 9) (11, 27) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 16) (24, 11) (24, 15) (12, 22) (12, 20) (12, 10) (12, 6) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 24) (10, 13) (10, 16) (10, 12) (25, 29) (25, 11) (6, 13) (6, 18) (6, 12) (2, 20) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the given list of edges, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

2. Let's write down all the 3-stars by listing the center node and the three connected nodes. 

<15, (0, 5, 24)>
<24, (15, 16, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (8, 15, 9)>
<7, (0, 14, 21)>
<14, (13, 7, 17)>
<21, (7, 16, 26)>
<8, (23, 5, 27)>
<23, (0, 8, 18)>
<13, (1, 14, 6)>
<17, (14, 3, 22)>
<1, (0, 13, 29)>
<3, (1, 17, 21)>
<29, (16, 1, 25)>
<16, (21, 10, 29)>
<18, (23, 6, 26)>
<12, (20, 6, 22)>
<20, (0, 12, 2)>
<6, (13, 12, 18)>
<10, (12, 16, 13)>
<2, (20)>

3. Now, count the unique 3-stars found.
   
   There are 22 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [22].
