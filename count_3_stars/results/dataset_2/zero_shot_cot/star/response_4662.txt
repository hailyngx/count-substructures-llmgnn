Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 24) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 13) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 17) (6, 8) (6, 27) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 20) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (20, 9) (20, 13) (20, 10) (25, 9) (25, 17) (25, 19) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 23) (27, 21) (27, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 10) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 0) (10, 21) (10, 20) (10, 26) (10, 13) (10, 14) (0, 16) (0, 21) (0, 29) (19, 25) (19, 18) (19, 28) (23, 12) (23, 26) (23, 14) (17, 21) (17, 25) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 4) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 22) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 24) (14, 10) (14, 23) (15, 7) (15, 22) (15, 4) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (22, 7) (22, 15) (4, 24) (4, 15) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 26), (1, 13)
- Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 18)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 12)
- Node 7: (7, 29), (7, 5), (7, 15)
- Node 10: (10, 21), (10, 20), (10, 26), (10, 13), (10, 14)
- Node 12: (12, 3), (12, 13), (12, 24), (12, 23)
- Node 13: (13, 1), (13, 20), (13, 12), (13, 10), (13, 7)
- Node 15: (15, 7), (15, 22), (15, 4)
- Node 16: (16, 11), (16, 0), (16, 24)
- Node 19: (19, 25), (19, 18), (19, 28)
- Node 21: (21, 10), (21, 0), (21, 27), (21, 17)
- Node 24: (24, 16), (24, 12), (24, 8), (24, 4)
- Node 25: (25, 9), (25, 17), (25, 19)
- Node 26: (26, 1), (26, 23), (26, 10)
- Node 29: (29, 28), (29, 7), (29, 0)

2. Identify the 3-star configurations:
- <1, (3, 26, 13)>
- <2, (9, 3, 18)>
- <3, (1, 2, 12)>
- <7, (29, 5, 15)>
- <10, (21, 20, 26)>
- <12, (3, 13, 24)>
- <13, (1, 20, 12)>
- <15, (7, 22, 4)>
- <16, (11, 0, 24)>
- <19, (25, 18, 28)>
- <21, (10, 0, 27)>
- <24, (16, 12, 8)>
- <25, (9, 17, 19)>
- <26, (1, 23, 10)>
- <29, (28, 7, 0)>
