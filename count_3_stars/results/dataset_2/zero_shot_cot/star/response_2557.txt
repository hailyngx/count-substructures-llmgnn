Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 29) (3, 26) (20, 1) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 19) (25, 17) (25, 18) (25, 24) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 0) (27, 12) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 13) (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 2) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 4) (29, 3) (29, 28) (29, 7) (19, 20) (19, 18) (26, 3) (26, 20) (26, 18) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 7) (28, 29) (28, 5) (28, 13) (18, 25) (18, 19) (18, 26) (2, 15) (2, 13) (22, 5) (22, 11) (16, 23) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (9, 27) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 10) (24, 25) (24, 0) (24, 10) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 24) (0, 8) (0, 13) (23, 16) (23, 4) (23, 10) (4, 17) (4, 14) (4, 23) (13, 27) (13, 15) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 24) (10, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

We can do this by examining each node and checking if it meets the criteria of being a central node in a 3-star. 

After analyzing the graph, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (7, 3, 21)>
<3, (1, 14, 29)>
<7, (1, 5, 29)>
<11, (14, 22, 27)>
<12, (0, 17, 21)>
<13, (0, 15, 27)>
<14, (3, 4, 11)>
<15, (2, 13, 20)>
<17, (12, 18, 25)>
<20, (1, 15, 26)>
<21, (1, 12, 27)>
<22, (5, 11, 28)>
<24, (0, 10, 25)>
<25, (17, 18, 24)>
<26, (3, 18, 20)>
<27, (12, 13, 27)>
<28, (5, 13, 29)>
<29, (3, 7, 28)>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
