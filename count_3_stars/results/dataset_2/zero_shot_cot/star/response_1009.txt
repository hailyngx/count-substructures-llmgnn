Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (26, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 25) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 1) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 28) (17, 12) (17, 20) (17, 3) (17, 7) (20, 17) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 24) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 23) (0, 6) (7, 27) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 0) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (16, 19) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 28) (18, 0) (18, 29) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 17) (24, 8) (24, 20) (24, 19) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 1) (11, 22) (11, 21) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 1) (29, 18) (29, 22) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 24) (19, 6) (22, 20) (22, 11) (22, 29) (22, 28) (6, 0) (6, 19) (28, 13) (28, 25) (28, 22) (21, 4) (21, 5) (21, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (8, 13, 25)>
<5, (12, 7, 21)>
<7, (27, 5, 17)>
<13, (4, 5, 3)>
<17, (12, 20, 3)>
<20, (17, 24, 14)>
<22, (20, 11, 29)>
<23, (0, 1, 15)>
<24, (8, 20, 19)>
<28, (13, 25, 22)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
