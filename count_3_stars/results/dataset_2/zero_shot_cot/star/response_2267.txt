Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 26) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 2) (2, 21) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 16) (29, 3) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 22) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 13) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 11) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 1) (12, 9) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 24) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 18) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 5) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 20) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 25) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 27) (19, 2) (5, 26) (22, 29) (22, 28) (22, 16) (25, 12) (25, 9) (14, 3) (14, 28) (24, 28) (24, 8) (27, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (16, 22) (11, 4) (11, 20) (11, 17) (17, 0) (17, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 28) (1, 23) (6, 8) (6, 23) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<3, (15, 14, 9)>
<15, (3, 26, 0)>
<4, (16, 11, 21)>
<7, (21, 12, 1)>
<21, (7, 28, 2)>
<2, (29, 19, 16)>
<29, (3, 2, 0)>
<0, (29, 17, 13)>
<20, (9, 23, 11)>
<12, (7, 25, 1)>
<28, (21, 1, 22)>
<13, (0, 26, 18)>
<26, (15, 13, 5)>
<8, (9, 24, 6)>
<9, (3, 20, 12)>
<10, (18, 23, 16)>
<18, (3, 13, 10)>
<19, (2, 29, 16)>
<5, (26, 15, 26)>
<22, (29, 28, 16)>
<25, (12, 9, 25)>
<14, (3, 28, 14)>
<24, (28, 8, 24)>
<27, (18, 27, 18)>
<16, (4, 2, 10)>
<11, (4, 20, 17)>
<17, (0, 11, 17)>
<1, (7, 12, 28)>
<6, (8, 23, 6)>
<23, (20, 10, 1)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.
