Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 21) (3, 1) (15, 1) (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 18) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 23) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 24) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 16) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 0) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 25) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 19) (17, 26) (0, 29) (0, 10) (0, 20) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 6) (20, 28) (28, 29) (28, 20) (28, 12) (25, 16) (25, 10) (25, 17) (25, 18) (27, 19) (27, 8) (26, 22) (26, 11) (26, 29) (26, 17) (9, 22) (9, 8) (8, 27) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 5) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 18) (23, 13) (23, 4) (6, 20) (14, 2) (12, 28) (12, 8) (21, 22) (21, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 25) (18, 5) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 27) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star. 
We will then find the connected nodes for each center node to form the 3-stars.

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 0}

After analyzing the edges, we found the following 3-stars:

<1, (3, 15, 17)>
<2, (20, 14, 6)>
<4, (11, 7, 23)>
<5, (24, 8, 18)>
<8, (27, 9, 21)>
<10, (0, 19, 25)>
<16, (29, 18, 25)>
<22, (13, 26, 21)>
<28, (29, 20, 12)>
<13, (22, 23, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
