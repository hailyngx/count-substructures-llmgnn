Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 10) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 6) (2, 0) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 18) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 11) (18, 13) (18, 1) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 16) 

Response:
Given the graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we need to count the number of 3-stars.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 5
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 3
- Node 9: degree = 4
- Node 10: degree = 4
- Node 11: degree = 4
- Node 12: degree = 4
- Node 13: degree = 3
- Node 14: degree = 4
- Node 15: degree = 2
- Node 16: degree = 4
- Node 17: degree = 3
- Node 18: degree = 2
- Node 19: degree = 4

Identifying the 3-stars:
- Nodes with degree 4 (excluding center): 3, 9, 6, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19
- Total 3-stars: 8
