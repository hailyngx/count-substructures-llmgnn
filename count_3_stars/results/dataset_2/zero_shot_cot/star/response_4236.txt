Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<9, (6, 8, 11)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<5, (6, 11, 0)>
<5, (6, 11, 7)>
<0, (5, 14, 1)>
<14, (0, 7, 12)>
<7, (5, 14, 12)>
<7, (5, 14, 13)>
<12, (14, 7, 3)>
<3, (9, 12, 8)>
<11, (9, 7, 5)>
<11, (9, 7, 2)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 14, 0)>
<0, (14, 1, 5)>
<14, (1, 7, 12)>
<7, (1, 14, 13)>
<7, (1, 14, 8)>
<12, (14, 7, 3)>
<3, (12, 8, 4)>
<8, (12, 4, 10)>
<11, (2, 9, 5)>
<11, (2, 9, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 13)>
<2, (6, 14, 11)>
<2, (6, 14, 13)>
<2, (6, 14, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].
