Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 21) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 21) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 0) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 17) (27, 6) (7, 12) (7, 26) (7, 17) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 8) (20, 15) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 16) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 6) (26, 7) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 21) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 4) (28, 20) (28, 0) (28, 25) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 5) (1, 29) (1, 5) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 1) (5, 8) (16, 29) (16, 20) (16, 21) (21, 29) (21, 18) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 16) (14, 18) (14, 24) (6, 27) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 8) (17, 12) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 3) (3, 20) (3, 17) (3, 13) (9, 23) (25, 29) (25, 28) (25, 13) (8, 15) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 13) (4, 11) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 25) (13, 0) (10, 23) 

Response:
Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3-stars with center node 29:
<29, (2, 1, 16)>
<29, (1, 16, 25)>
<29, (16, 25, 21)>

- 3-stars with center node 18:
<18, (22, 14, 21)>
<18, (21, 13, 22)>

- 3-stars with center node 22:
<22, (18, 11, 0)>

- 3-stars with center node 23:
<23, (15, 10, 9)>

- 3-stars with center node 12:
<12, (7, 5, 17)>

- 3-stars with center node 7:
<7, (12, 26, 17)>

- 3-stars with center node 15:
<15, (23, 20, 8)>

- 3-stars with center node 20:
<20, (15, 21, 3)>
<20, (21, 16, 28)>
<20, (16, 28, 0)>
<20, (28, 25, 0)>

- 3-stars with center node 26:
<26, (19, 6, 24)>

- 3-stars with center node 11:
<11, (22, 13, 4)>

- 3-stars with center node 28:
<28, (20, 0, 25)>

- 3-stars with center node 24:
<24, (26, 14, 5)>

- 3-stars with center node 1:
<1, (29, 5, 1)>

- 3-stars with center node 5:
<5, (12, 24, 1)>
<5, (24, 8, 1)>
<5, (8, 6, 1)>

- 3-stars with center node 16:
<16, (29, 20, 21)>

- 3-stars with center node 21:
<21, (29, 26, 16)>

- 3-stars with center node 14:
<14, (18, 24, 5)>

- 3-stars with center node 6:
<6, (27, 19, 17)>
<6, (19, 8, 6)>

- 3-stars with center node 17:
<17, (12, 7, 6)>
<17, (7, 26, 3)>

- 3-stars with center node 3:
<3, (20, 17, 13)>

- 3-stars with center node 9:
<9, (23, 10, 9)>

- 3-stars with center node 25:
<25, (29, 13, 25)>

- 3-stars with center node 8:
<8, (15, 5, 6)>

- 3-stars with center node 0:
<0, (22, 28, 13)>

- 3-stars with center node 4:
<4, (11, 13, 0)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [27]
