Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs, we need to look for nodes that are connected in a star pattern (center node connected to exactly three other nodes). 

Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 4 <1, (0, 2, 4)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 7 <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 8 <6, (0, 1, 8)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 8 <9, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [4]. 

<1, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>
