Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze the given graph to find all 3-stars.

1. For each node with exactly three edges, check if it forms a 3-star:
   - (13) is connected to 2, 20, and 7 -> <13, (2, 7, 20)>
   - (22) is connected to 0, 3, and no other third node, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - (1) is connected to 10, 4, and 12 -> <1, (10, 4, 12)>
   - (21) is connected to 26, 18, and 29 -> <21, (26, 18, 29)>
   - (29) is connected to 21, 2, and 10 -> <29, (21, 2, 10)>
   - (6) is connected to 9, 24, and no other third node, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - (9) is connected to 6, 8, and 24 -> <9, (6, 8, 24)>
   - (18) is connected to 21, 19, and 25 -> <18, (21, 19, 25)>
   - (0) is connected to 22, 20, and no other third node, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - (20) is connected to 13, 2, and 0 -> <20, (13, 2, 0)>
   - (15) is connected to 20, 11, and 16 -> <15, (20, 11, 16)>
   - (26) is connected to 21, 28, and 5 -> <26, (21, 28, 5)>
   - (3) is connected to 22, 11, and 7 -> <3, (22, 11, 7)>
   - (11) is connected to 15, 3, and 27 -> <11, (15, 3, 27)>
   - (5) is connected to 26, 11, and 7 -> <5, (26, 11, 7)>
   - (7) is connected to 13, 3, and 5 -> <7, (13, 3, 5)>
   - (17) is connected to 24, 23, and 7 -> <17, (24, 23, 7)>
   - (10) is connected to 1, 29, and 3 -> <10, (1, 29, 3)>
   - (14) is connected to 9, 4, and 25 -> <14, (9, 4, 25)>
   - (27) is connected to 11, 7, and no other third node, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - (12) is connected to 1, 26, and no other third node, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - (16) is connected to 15, 25, and no other third node, so it does not form a 3-star.
   - (19) is connected to 2, 18, and no other third node, so it does not form a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: 8
Unique 3-stars:
<13, (2, 7, 20)>
<1, (10, 4, 12)>
<21, (26, 18, 29)>
<29, (21, 2, 10)>
<9, (6, 8, 24)>
<18, (21, 19, 25)>
<20, (13, 2, 0)>
<15, (20, 11, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
