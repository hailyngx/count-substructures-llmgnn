Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 13) (14, 0) (14, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 28) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 23) (13, 18) (22, 2) (22, 20) (22, 1) (23, 13) (23, 21) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 27) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 21) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 16) (29, 28) (29, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 29) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 2) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 5) (2, 6) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 21) (26, 16) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 19) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 26) (21, 25) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 19) (25, 27) (25, 14) (25, 21) (5, 2) (3, 18) (1, 22) (19, 15) (19, 27) (19, 16) (19, 4) (9, 17) (9, 0) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (14, 10, 7)>
<2, (8, 22, 5)>
<4, (12, 6, 19)>
<6, (17, 10, 4)>
<7, (11, 0, 12)>
<12, (29, 7, 4)>
<13, (27, 17, 18)>
<16, (28, 26, 19)>
<19, (27, 15, 16)>
<21, (26, 11, 25)>
<25, (27, 14, 21)>

There are 11 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
