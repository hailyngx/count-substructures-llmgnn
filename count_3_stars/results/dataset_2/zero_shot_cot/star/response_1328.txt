Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 0) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 17) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 11) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 16) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (9, 1) (9, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (17, 2) (17, 15) 

Response:
The given graph has the following 3-stars:
<0, (13, 7, 15)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (18, 6, 17)>
<3, (11, 10, 19)>
<4, (9, 5, 12)>
<5, (1, 19, 4)>
<6, (7, 2, 17)>
<7, (8, 0, 19)>
<8, (13, 18, 14)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<10, (3, 19, 12)>
<11, (3, 18, 14)>
<12, (5, 10, 14)>
<13, (8, 16, 0)>
<14, (8, 11, 12)>
<15, (0, 16, 17)>
<16, (13, 19, 15)>
<17, (2, 15, 6)>
<18, (8, 11, 2)>
<19, (7, 5, 10)>

Therefore, there are [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
