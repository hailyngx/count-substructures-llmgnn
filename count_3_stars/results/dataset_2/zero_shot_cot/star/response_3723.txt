Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the node 4 (the center) to form 3-star graphs:

1. Node 6, Node 7, Node 8, Node 9

Now, let's count how many 3-stars we have for each central node:

Node 4: 4 3-stars
Node 6: 1 3-star
Node 7: 1 3-star
Node 8: 1 3-star
Node 9: 1 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 8].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, (6, 7, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 9, 5, 8)>
<7, (4, 0, 5, 1)>
<8, (4, 6, 2, 5)>
<9, (4, 3, 6, 2)>
