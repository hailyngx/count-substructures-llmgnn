Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by looking at each node and determining if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star has one central node and three leaves connected to it. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7) -> <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 1: (1, 0, 2, 3, 6) -> <1, (0, 2, 3)>
- Node 2: (2, 1, 3, 4, 9) -> <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 3: (3, 0, 1, 2, 8, 9) -> <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 4: (4, 0, 2, 8, 9) -> <4, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 5: (5, 6, 7, 8) -> No 3-stars
- Node 6: (6, 0, 1, 5) -> <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 7: (7, 0, 5, 8) -> No 3-stars
- Node 8: (8, 4, 5, 7, 9) -> <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- Node 9: (9, 2, 3, 4, 8) -> <9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: 8
