Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 17) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 0) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (16, 4) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 6) (18, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
Given the edges provided, let's first identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 18, 12, and 1.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 2, and 13.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 5, 4, and 14.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 13, 2, and 0.
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 9, 4, and 8.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 8, and 11.
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 9, 13, and 3.
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 7, 11, and 12.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 5, 14, and 0.
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 8, 2, and 11.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 13, 12, and 10.
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 9, 0, and 18.

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- From node 5: <5, (18, 12, 1)>
- From node 4: <4, (7, 2, 13)>
- From node 7: <7, (5, 4, 14)>
- From node 8: <8, (13, 2, 0)>
- From node 13: <13, (9, 4, 8)>
- From node 2: <2, (4, 8, 11)>
- From node 17: <17, (9, 13, 3)>
- From node 14: <14, (7, 11, 12)>
- From node 12: <12, (5, 14, 0)>
- From node 0: <0, (8, 2, 11)>
- From node 6: <6, (13, 12, 10)>
- From node 19: <19, (9, 0, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
