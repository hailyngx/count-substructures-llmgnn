Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 8) (3, 13) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 27) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 20) (7, 12) (7, 20) (7, 18) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 0) (29, 14) (29, 17) (29, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 16) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 16) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 2) (11, 23) (11, 0) (23, 11) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 19) (16, 26) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 20) (4, 22) (4, 3) (4, 25) (19, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 29) (8, 22) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 27) (9, 28) (25, 6) (25, 4) (20, 10) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 21) (20, 16) (1, 24) (1, 2) (1, 28) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 21) (2, 1) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 28) (28, 13) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 18) (27, 17) (27, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 22, 2, and 3.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 13, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 13, 15, and 4.
(There are no other nodes connected to exactly three other nodes in this graph.)

2. List the unique 3-stars:
<13, (22, 2, 3)>
<22, (13, 4, 8)>
<3, (13, 15, 4)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [3]
