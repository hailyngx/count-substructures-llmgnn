Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<6, (9, 7, 0)>
<6, (1, 4, 2)>
<6, (1, 7, 0)>
<6, (4, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, 1, 2)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>
<9, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (6, 2, 1)>
<8, (2, 5, 3)>
<8, (2, 7, 3)>
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<2, (4, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 7, 5)>
<0, (6, 9, 2)>
<0, (6, 7, 2)>
<7, (6, 8, 0)>
<7, (6, 3, 0)>
<1, (6, 9, 4)>
<3, (9, 8, 7)>
<3, (8, 7, 5)>
<5, (8, 2, 3)>

There are 23 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [23].
