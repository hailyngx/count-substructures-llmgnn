Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

For a node to be part of a 3-star, it must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 2.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 11.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 5, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 2.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 13, 3, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 5, and 9.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 5, and 14.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:
[<4, (9, 13, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 13)>, <10, (11, 8, 12)>, <11, (10, 3, 13)>, <5, (11, 13, 2)>, <13, (4, 7, 11)>, <3, (7, 11, 0)>, <8, (10, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 2)>, <0, (13, 3, 9)>, <2, (10, 5, 9)>, <14, (3, 6, 1)>, <6, (4, 7, 11)>, <1, (8, 14, 12)>, <12, (10, 5, 14)>]

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
