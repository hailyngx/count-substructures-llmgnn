Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7)
   <0, (3, 4, 7)>

2. Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 9)
   <1, (4, 8, 9)>

3. Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 8)
   <2, (0, 7, 8)>

4. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 7)
   <3, (0, 5, 7)>

5. Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5)
   <4, (0, 1, 5)>

6. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7)
   <5, (3, 4, 7)>

7. Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8)
   <6, (2, 4, 8)>

8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5)
   <7, (0, 2, 5)>

9. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 5)
   <8, (1, 2, 5)>

10. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 8)
    <9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-star structures in the given graph.
