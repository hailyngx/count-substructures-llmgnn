Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 11) (3, 20) (18, 22) (18, 10) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 0) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 6) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 19) (19, 14) (19, 16) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 12) (6, 26) (21, 27) (21, 9) (21, 12) (21, 4) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 8) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 5) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 5) (16, 19) (16, 17) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 17) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 20) (24, 11) (24, 9) (29, 4) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 12) (12, 11) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 9) (4, 21) (4, 29) (4, 9) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 12) (9, 4) (23, 15) (27, 21) (27, 5) (5, 0) (5, 25) (5, 15) (5, 12) (5, 27) (13, 0) (13, 25) (13, 28) (10, 1) (10, 18) (28, 14) (28, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges:

1. 3-star with center node 1: (1, 10), (1, 17), (1, 26) <1, (10, 17, 26)>
2. 3-star with center node 22: (22, 0), (22, 2), (22, 18) <22, (0, 2, 18)>
3. 3-star with center node 14: (14, 0), (14, 7), (14, 19) <14, (0, 7, 19)>
4. 3-star with center node 11: (11, 3), (11, 7), (11, 24) <11, (3, 7, 24)>
5. 3-star with center node 26: (26, 1), (26, 2), (26, 20) <26, (1, 2, 20)>
6. 3-star with center node 7: (7, 11), (7, 14), (7, 25) <7, (11, 14, 25)>
7. 3-star with center node 20: (20, 2), (20, 3), (20, 26) <20, (2, 3, 26)>
8. 3-star with center node 9: (9, 4), (9, 12), (9, 21) <9, (4, 12, 21)>
9. 3-star with center node 12: (12, 5), (12, 9), (12, 20) <12, (5, 9, 20)>
10. 3-star with center node 5: (5, 0), (5, 12), (5, 15) <5, (0, 12, 15)>
11. 3-star with center node 17: (17, 1), (17, 2), (17, 16) <17, (1, 2, 16)>
12. 3-star with center node 7: (7, 8), (7, 11), (7, 14) (duplicates previously found 3-star)
13. 3-star with center node 20: (20, 12), (20, 2), (20, 26) (duplicates previously found 3-star)
14. 3-star with center node 22: (22, 0), (22, 2), (22, 18) (duplicates previously found 3-star)
15. 3-star with center node 5: (5, 12), (5, 27), (5, 15) (duplicates previously found 3-star)

[The total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 11.]
