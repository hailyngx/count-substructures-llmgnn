Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 27) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 19) (7, 20) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 26) (21, 13) (21, 11) (21, 15) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 14) (27, 5) (27, 12) (27, 24) (28, 5) (28, 2) (29, 22) (29, 25) (29, 15) (29, 14) (26, 13) (26, 7) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 4) (10, 26) (10, 1) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 29) (15, 14) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 23) (11, 24) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 24) (8, 20) (8, 18) (1, 10) (6, 14) (19, 22) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 2) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 23) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 4) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 6) (20, 7) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 16) (2, 28) (2, 19) (2, 17) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 20) (25, 29) (25, 26) (16, 20) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. To form a 3-star, a node must be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 22, 21, and 12.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 13, 19, and 29.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 28, and 27.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 15, and 11.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 20, 24, and 19.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 15.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 27, and 14.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 24.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 19.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 22, 25, and 14.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 13, 7, and 10.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 26, 1, and 4.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 21, and 29.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 21, and 23.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 11, 4, and 24.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 29.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 16.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 2, 18, and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 28, 19, and 17.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 26, 23, and 17.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 29 and 26.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 13, 8, and 17.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
There are 22 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

[22] 

The unique 3-stars are:
<13, (22, 21, 12)>
<22, (13, 19, 29)>
<5, (9, 28, 27)>
<9, (5, 15, 11)>
<7, (20, 24, 19)>
<21, (13, 11, 15)>
<12, (13, 27, 14)>
<27, (5, 12, 24)>
<28, (5, 2, 19)>
<29, (22, 25, 14)>
<26, (13, 7, 10)>
<10, (26, 1, 4)>
<15, (9, 21, 29)>
<11, (9, 21, 23)>
<23, (11, 4, 24)>
<14, (5, 12, 29)>
<20, (7, 8, 16)>
<17, (2, 18, 4)>
<2, (28, 19, 17)>
<4, (26, 23, 17)>
<25, (29, 26)>
<18, (13, 8, 17)>
