Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 has a 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 11)>
- Node 2 has a 3-star: <2, (10, 12, 13)>
- Node 3 has a 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 7)>
- Node 4 has a 3-star: <4, (9, 10, 13)>
- Node 6 has a 3-star: <6, (7, 8, 11)>
- Node 9 has a 3-star: <9, (3, 11, 12)>
- Node 10 has a 3-star: <10, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 13 has a 3-star: <13, (0, 4, 14)>
- Node 14 has a 3-star: <14, (0, 9, 13)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [9].
