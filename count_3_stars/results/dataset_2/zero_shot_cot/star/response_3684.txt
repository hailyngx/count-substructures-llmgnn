Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 21) (5, 3) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 11) (2, 27) (2, 3) (2, 28) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 20) (18, 29) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 25) (0, 6) (0, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (8, 21) (16, 1) (16, 13) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 27) (19, 23) (22, 19) (22, 24) (22, 25) (26, 10) (26, 29) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 13) (1, 16) (1, 11) (1, 13) (11, 17) (11, 1) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 23) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 29) (29, 18) (29, 26) (29, 21) (29, 25) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 24) (24, 12) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 4) (25, 12) (25, 22) (25, 29) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 20) (4, 6) (4, 24) (4, 28) (28, 2) (28, 4) (28, 27) (27, 5) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 3, 21)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<6, (9, 0, 4)>
<10, (17, 20, 26)>
<17, (10, 11, 18)>
<2, (27, 28, 3)>
<18, (17, 15, 20)>
<7, (12, 19, )]
<12, (7, 25, 24)>
<0, (6, 13, )]
<14, (23, 15, )]
<8, (21, )]
<16, (1, 13, )]
<19, (7, 22, 23)>
<22, (19, 25, 24)>
<26, (10, 29, )]
<15, (18, 14, 13)>
<1, (16, 11, 13)>
<11, (17, 1, )]
<20, (10, 23, 18)>
<21, (5, 8, 29)>
<29, (18, 26, 25)>
<3, (5, 2, 9)>
<13, (0, 16, 15, 1)>
<24, (12, 22, 4, 13)>
<25, (12, 22, 29)>
<23, (14, 19, 20)>
<4, (6, 24, 28)>
<28, (2, 4, 27)>


Now, counting how many 3-stars are there in total: 
[27]
