Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 21) (4, 21) (4, 25) (7, 9) (7, 28) (12, 13) (12, 8) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 1) (2, 18) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 6) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 11) (20, 18) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 28) (14, 0) (14, 3) (8, 12) (8, 22) (8, 3) (22, 26) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 16) (17, 6) (29, 24) (29, 11) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 21) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 23) (25, 4) (25, 1) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 22) (10, 27) (10, 0) (10, 23) (11, 0) (11, 29) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 5) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 21) (13, 12) (13, 21) (13, 28) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 15) (21, 23) (21, 13) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 14) (3, 8) (5, 24) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<9, (26, 7, 23)>
<26, (9, 22, 21)>
<4, (21, 25, 15)>
<7, (9, 28, 20)>
<12, (13, 8, 1)>
<27, (24, 10, 1)>
<2, (18, 3, 14)>
<18, (2, 19, 20)>
<0, (20, 14, 16)>
<20, (18, 0, 28)>
<8, (12, 22, 3)>
<22, (26, 8, 19)>
<17, (6, 29, 11)>
<29, (24, 11, 5)>
<1, (27, 15, 25)>
<15, (1, 21, 5)>
<6, (18, 17, 23)>
<25, (4, 1, 15)>
<19, (9, 18, 22)>
<10, (27, 0, 23)>
<11, (0, 29, 5)>
<24, (27, 29, 5)>
<23, (9, 6, 10)>
<13, (12, 21, 28)>
<21, (26, 4, 15)>
<3, (2, 20, 14)>
<5, (24, 15, 11)>
<28, (7, 20, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
