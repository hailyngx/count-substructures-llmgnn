Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 17) (9, 11) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 14) (13, 6) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (19, 4) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 6) (18, 16) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes with exactly three edges, indicating possible center nodes of 3-stars. These are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 13, 18.

Next, let's examine each of these nodes to see if they form valid 3-stars with exactly three connected nodes.

- For node 0, (0, 16, 18) is a 3-star.
- For node 1, (1, 14, 15) is a 3-star.
- For node 4, (4, 2, 19) is a 3-star.
- For node 5, there are no 3-stars as it does not have exactly three connected nodes.
- For node 6, (6, 7, 10) is a 3-star.
- For node 13, (13, 6, 14) is a 3-star.
- For node 18, (18, 0, 16) is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4. 

[4] 

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (16, 18)>
- <1, (14, 15)>
- <4, (2, 19)>
- <6, (7, 10)>
