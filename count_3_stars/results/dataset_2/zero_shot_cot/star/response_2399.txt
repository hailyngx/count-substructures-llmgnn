Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 0) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 14) (5, 18) (5, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 17) (17, 18) (17, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 0) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:
1. <0, (8, 15, 12)>
2. <2, (14, 19, 2)>
3. <3, (12, 10, 17)>
4. <4, (9, 13, 18)>
5. <5, (7, 18, 5)>
6. <6, (13, 9, 12)>
7. <7, (8, 5, 7)>
8. <8, (1, 14, 0)>
9. <9, (6, 4, 16)>
10. <10, (3, 15, 10)>
11. <11, (19, 9, 11)>
12. <12, (6, 3, 17)>
13. <13, (6, 14, 4)>
14. <14, (8, 2, 13)>
15. <15, (0, 10, 4)>
16. <16, (9, 18, 4)>
17. <17, (12, 18, 3)>
18. <18, (5, 16, 4)>
19. <19, (11, 2, 18)>

There are total [19] 3-stars in the graph.
