Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<5, (1, 0, 2)>
<9, (6, 13, 7)>
<6, (3, 0, 2)>
<0, (10, 14, 5)>
