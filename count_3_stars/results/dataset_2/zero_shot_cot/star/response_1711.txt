Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, 9 (degree: 5)
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, 9 (degree: 5)
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 3 (degree: 3)
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5 (degree: 4)
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 (degree: 5)
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 6 (degree: 3)
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 5 (degree: 2)
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, 9 (degree: 5)
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 9 (degree: 3)
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, 8 (degree: 5)

From the analysis, we see that the nodes 2, 5, and 6 are not part of any 3-stars, as they do not have degree 3 or higher.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7 <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, and 7 <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4 <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7, and 9 <4, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 4 <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 7 <9, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Thus, the answer is [5].
