Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 11) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 12, 14)>
<1, (3, 6, 11)>
<3, (1, 0, 14)>
<8, (4, 3, 0)>
<13, (5, 11, 10)>
<12, (7, 2, 0)>
<2, (12, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 13, 2)>
<6, (1, 2, 14)>
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<10, (1, 13, 14)>
<11, (1, 13, 2)>
<14, (7, 3, 5)>
<9, (4, 13, 10)>

Counting the number of 3-stars gives us a total of [15] 3-stars in the graph.
