Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph.

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<6, (4, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
