Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 23) (1, 23) (21, 0) (21, 12) (6, 5) (6, 26) (6, 27) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 10) (0, 21) (0, 26) (27, 6) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 5) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 27) (7, 4) (5, 6) (5, 27) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 20) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 28) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 10) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 29) (17, 4) (17, 29) (17, 12) (17, 22) (29, 18) (29, 17) (29, 19) (24, 27) (24, 26) (26, 6) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 20) (26, 25) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 25) (19, 29) (19, 15) (14, 22) (14, 12) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 14) (3, 4) (3, 2) (20, 5) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 28) (23, 16) (23, 1) (12, 21) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 25) (13, 20) (25, 26) (25, 15) (25, 12) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 28) (28, 4) (28, 2) (28, 20) (28, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (21, 26, 20)>
<1, (23, 16, 11)>
<2, (9, 8, 28)>
<3, (4, 2, 28)>
<5, (6, 27, 22)>
<7, (27, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 10, 18)>
<15, (5, 25, 19)>
<17, (4, 29, 12)>
<18, (16, 20, 29)>
<20, (26, 5, 28)>
<22, (5, 14, 17)>
<25, (26, 12, 15)>
<26, (6, 0, 24)>
<27, (6, 24, 7)>
<28, (4, 20, 10)>
<29, (18, 19, 17)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
