Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

First, let's list out the nodes with the edges connected to them:
0: 6, 7, 2, 5
1: 9, 7, 5
2: 9, 0, 7, 3, 5
3: 9, 4, 2
4: 6, 9, 8, 3
5: 0, 1, 2
6: 9, 7, 4, 8, 0
7: 6, 0, 2, 1
8: 6, 9, 4
9: 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, 1

Now, let's find all the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 7, 2)>
<0, (6, 7, 5)>
<0, (6, 2, 5)>

<1, (9, 7, 5)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>

<2, (9, 0, 7)>
<2, (9, 2, 3)>
<2, (9, 2, 5)>

<3, (9, 4, 2)>

<4, (6, 9, 8)>

<5, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 5)>

<6, (9, 8, 4)>
<6, (7, 8, 4)>
<6, (0, 8, 4)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>

<7, (6, 0, 7)>
<7, (6, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 7)>

<8, (6, 4, 9)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>

<9, (3, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, the final answer is [27].
