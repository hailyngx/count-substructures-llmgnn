Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 13) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 15) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 8) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (7, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 10) (2, 16) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 3) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 6) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (6, 14) (6, 15) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 13) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars: 
<5, (0, 9, 19)>
<16, (2, 3, 18)>
<14, (6, 9, 11)>
<17, (1, 14, 19)>
<18, (4, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
