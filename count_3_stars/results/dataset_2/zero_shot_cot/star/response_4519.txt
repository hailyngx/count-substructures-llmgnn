Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 23) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 18) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 19) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 8) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 19) (4, 21) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 17) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 28) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 18) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 24) (21, 27) (21, 4) (21, 23) (14, 20) (14, 26) (14, 24) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 6) (26, 12) (3, 28) (3, 19) (28, 2) (28, 3) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 15) (22, 0) (22, 4) (22, 6) (16, 20) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 29) (24, 7) (24, 14) (24, 16) (24, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 3) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 13) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 12) (23, 9) (23, 17) (23, 21) (12, 26) (12, 29) (13, 15) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:

Node 0: 27, 7, 22, 2
Node 1: 17, 16
Node 2: 5, 0, 28
Node 3: 28, 19
Node 4: 8, 22, 19, 21
Node 5: 2, 11
Node 6: 26, 22, 15
Node 7: 9, 0, 10, 11, 24
Node 8: 25, 4, 17
Node 9: 7, 23
Node 10: 7
Node 11: 5, 7, 19
Node 12: 26, 29
Node 13: 15
Node 14: 20, 26, 24
Node 15: 26, 6, 13
Node 16: 20, 1, 24, 29
Node 17: 8, 1, 23, 19, 18
Node 18: 27, 17, 24
Node 19: 11, 4, 17, 3
Node 20: 25, 14, 16
Node 21: 27, 4, 23
Node 22: 0, 4, 6
Node 23: 9, 17, 21
Node 24: 7, 14, 16, 18
Node 25: 20, 8
Node 26: 14, 26, 6, 12, 15
Node 27: 0, 27, 21, 18
Node 28: 2, 3
Node 29: 27, 16, 12

Next, identify the 3-star configurations. A 3-star is formed when one node is connected to exactly three other nodes:

- <0, (27, 7, 22)>
- <0, (27, 7, 2)>
- <0, (27, 7, 22)>
- <0, (27, 7, 2)>
- <1, (17, 16, 1)>
- <3, (28, 19, 3)>
- <5, (2, 11, 5)>
- <6, (26, 15, 6)>
- <9, (7, 23, 9)>
- <10, (7, 10, 11)>
- <12, (26, 29, 12)>
- <13, (15, 13, 6)>
- <14, (20, 26, 14)>
- <18, (27, 17, 18)>
- <20, (25, 16, 20)>
- <21, (27, 4, 21)>
- <24, (7, 16, 24)>
- <26, (14, 12, 26)>
- <28, (2, 3, 28)>
- <29, (13, 29, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
