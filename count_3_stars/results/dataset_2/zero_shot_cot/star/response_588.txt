Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 10) (9, 0) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 13) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 18) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 2) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 8) (18, 10) (19, 7) (19, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 16) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 1) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <16, (1, 13, 6)> and <4, (2, 11, 7)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
