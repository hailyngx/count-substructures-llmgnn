Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 14) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 21) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 9) (21, 23) (21, 10) (21, 13) (21, 20) (28, 1) (7, 22) (25, 27) (25, 0) (25, 12) (25, 11) (16, 17) (16, 27) (13, 21) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 27) (19, 9) (27, 25) (27, 16) (27, 5) (27, 10) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 29) (9, 24) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 26) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 27) (22, 7) (22, 24) (12, 25) (1, 28) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 4) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 26) (6, 0) (14, 15) (14, 23) (14, 2) (20, 21) (20, 24) (26, 29) (26, 6) (0, 8) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 24) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 20) (24, 0) (11, 25) (11, 5) (11, 4) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the definition of a 3-star, we need to find nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 

From the given edges, we identify the following nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 1 has 5 edges (1, 28), (1, 13), (1, 5), (1, 29), (1, 4)
- Node 6 has 4 edges (6, 15), (6, 17), (6, 26), (6, 0)
- Node 8 has 4 edges (8, 23), (8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 0)
- Node 13 has 5 edges (13, 21), (13, 17), (13, 4), (13, 1), (13, 10)
- Node 17 has 4 edges (17, 16), (17, 13), (17, 6), (17, 5)
- Node 21 has 4 edges (21, 23), (21, 10), (21, 13), (21, 20)
- Node 24 has 4 edges (24, 9), (24, 22), (24, 20), (24, 0)
- Node 25 has 5 edges (25, 27), (25, 0), (25, 12), (25, 11), (25, 5)
- Node 27 has 4 edges (27, 25), (27, 16), (27, 5), (27, 10)
- Node 29 has 4 edges (29, 9), (29, 1), (29, 26), (29, 6)

Let's now examine these nodes to form the 3-stars. 

Counting the 3-stars in the graph: 
- For each of these nodes, we check if the nodes adjacent to them are connected to each other. If they are, then we have a 3-star.
- Counting these unique 3-stars will give us the final answer.
