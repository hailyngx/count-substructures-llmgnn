Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them:

1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 14)
2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 14), (9, 13)
3. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 11), (4, 2)
4. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 6), (8, 7)
5. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 3), (6, 11)
6. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 11)
7. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 14), (0, 11)
8. Node 14: (14, 5), (14, 9), (14, 0), (14, 10)
9. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 12)
10. Node 7: (7, 8), (7, 3), (7, 13), (7, 1)
11. Node 1: (1, 7), (1, 11), (1, 12)
12. Node 11: (11, 9), (11, 4), (11, 6), (11, 2), (11, 0), (11, 1)
13. Node 12: (12, 3), (12, 1), (12, 13), (12, 10)
14. Node 13: (13, 9), (13, 2), (13, 7), (13, 12)
15. Node 10: (10, 8), (10, 14), (10, 12)

Now we can identify the 3-star patterns:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 14)>
<4, (9, 11, 2)>
<8, (2, 10, 6)>
<6, (5, 8, 11)>
<2, (4, 8, 13)>
<0, (5, 14, 11)>
<14, (9, 5, 0)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (8, 3, 13)>
<1, (7, 11, 12)>
<11, (9, 4, 6)>
<12, (3, 1, 13)>
<13, (9, 2, 7)>
<10, (8, 14, 12)>

Finally, counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we find that there are 15 unique 3-stars.
Thus, the number of 3-stars is [15].
