Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (6, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: {7, 14, 3, 12}
- Node 1: {4, 10, 8, 14, 12, 13}
- Node 2: {9, 12, 3}
- Node 3: {5, 7, 10, 0, 14, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 7, 8, 1}
- Node 5: {9, 4, 3}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {4, 0, 3, 6}
- Node 8: {4, 14, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 2, 11, 10, 13, 12}
- Node 10: {9, 11, 3, 1}
- Node 11: {9, 10}
- Node 12: {9, 0, 2, 13, 1}
- Node 13: {9, 14, 12, 1}
- Node 14: {8, 0, 3, 13, 1}

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Number of 3-stars = <0, (7, 14, 12)> = 1
- Number of 3-stars = <1, (4, 8, 14)> = 1
- Number of 3-stars = <2, (9, 11, 10)> = 1
- Number of 3-stars = <3, (5, 7, 10)> = 1
- Number of 3-stars = <4, (5, 7, 8)> = 1
- Number of 3-stars = <9, (5, 4, 3)> = 1
- Number of 3-stars = <12, (9, 13, 1)> = 1
- Number of 3-stars = <14, (8, 1, 13)> = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
