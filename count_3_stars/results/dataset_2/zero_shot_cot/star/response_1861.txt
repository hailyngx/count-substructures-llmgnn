Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 20) (16, 22) (16, 9) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 4) (27, 11) (27, 25) (27, 19) (9, 16) (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 7) (1, 15) (1, 3) (1, 28) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 28) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 0) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 21) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 21) (2, 4) (22, 16) (22, 24) (24, 26) (24, 22) (24, 14) (20, 11) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 12) (21, 25) (5, 3) (5, 29) (25, 27) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 28) (0, 23) (0, 29) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 25) (28, 4) (6, 17) (6, 25) (6, 29) (6, 18) (14, 24) (14, 18) (12, 21) (12, 25) (12, 18) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 2) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 7) (7, 26) (7, 18) (7, 13) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 28) (4, 29) (13, 3) (13, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges:
   - Node 11, Node 27, Node 3, Node 1, and Node 28.
  
2. For Node 11:
   - <11, (10, 27, 20)> is a 3-star.
   
3. For Node 27:
   - <27, (11, 25, 19)> is a 3-star.
   
4. For Node 3:
   - <3, (1, 10, 13)> is a 3-star.
   
5. For Node 1:
   - <1, (15, 3, 28)> is a 3-star.
   
6. For Node 28:
   - <28, (8, 25, 4)> is a 3-star.
   
7. For the above 3-stars, note that some are counted twice (e.g., 3, 1, 28). Remove duplicates:
   - <11, (10, 27, 20)>, <27, (11, 25, 19)>, and <3, (1, 10, 13)> are unique 3-stars.
  
8. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [3]. 

Thus, the final answer is [3].
