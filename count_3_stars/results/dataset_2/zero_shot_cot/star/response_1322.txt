Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 10) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 12) (13, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 12) (0, 2) (16, 7) (16, 18) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 14) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 2) (19, 11) (19, 10) (15, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 12) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 10) (14, 18) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 8, 11)>
<4, (6, 10, 11)>
<7, (8, 11, 16)>
<5, (2, 12, 18)>
<9, (15, 18, 7)>
<17, (2, 3, 11)>
