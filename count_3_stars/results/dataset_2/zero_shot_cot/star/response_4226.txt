Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 14) (3, 27) (3, 5) (25, 29) (25, 5) (25, 8) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 22) (15, 24) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 5) (0, 8) (0, 28) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 21) (21, 2) (21, 14) (21, 11) (28, 0) (28, 12) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 1) (22, 15) (22, 9) (22, 5) (24, 15) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 7) (7, 8) (7, 26) (7, 11) (7, 19) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 23) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 23) (18, 14) (18, 5) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (4, 23) (4, 6) (11, 21) (11, 7) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 9) (17, 24) (17, 6) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 19) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 20) (5, 22) (5, 18) (23, 10) (23, 27) (23, 4) (12, 28) (12, 19) (16, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which is the definition of a 3-star.

Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (2, 20, 9)>
<2, (1, 27, 21)>
<5, (3, 20, 22)>
<8, (0, 25, 13)>
<9, (10, 1, 22)>
<10, (9, 1, 15)>
<13, (8, 25, 0)>
<14, (29, 18, 21)>
<15, (26, 10, 24)>
<17, (24, 9, 6)>
<18, (5, 14, 5)>
<19, (7, 1, 12)>
<20, (5, 2, 26)>
<21, (14, 2, 11)>
<22, (5, 15, 9)>
<23, (4, 10, 27)>
<24, (15, 26, 17)>
<25, (29, 8, 5)>
<26, (20, 15, 7)>
<27, (23, 3, 2)>
<28, (0, 12, 28)>
<29, (2, 14, 25)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
