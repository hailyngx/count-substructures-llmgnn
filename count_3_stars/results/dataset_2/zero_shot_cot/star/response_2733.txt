Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 6) (10, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 18) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 6) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 13) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 13) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we can identify them based on this pattern.

The nodes that are part of a 3-star in this graph are:  

- Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 17, 12
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 8, 2
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 8, 19
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 17, 11, 15
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 18, 12
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 2, 15, 16

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are:  
<1, (5, 17, 12)>  
<3, (5, 8, 2)>  
<4, (7, 8, 19)>  
<6, (17, 11, 15)>  
<9, (5, 18, 12)>  
<13, (2, 15, 16)>  

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [6].
