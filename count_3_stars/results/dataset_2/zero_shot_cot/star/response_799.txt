Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. 

A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes connected to it. Since there are 15 nodes in the graph, for each of the 15 nodes, we will check whether it forms a 3-star structure.

Here are the steps to identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5 has edges with nodes 6, 4, and 3. So, <5, (6, 4, 3)> forms a 3-star.
2. Node 9 has edges with nodes 10, 7, and 13. So, <9, (10, 7, 13)> forms a 3-star.
3. Node 10 has edges with nodes 9, 3, and 6. So, <10, (9, 3, 6)> forms a 3-star.
4. Node 6 has edges with nodes 5, 10, and 14. So, <6, (5, 10, 14)> forms a 3-star.
5. Node 2 has edges with nodes 8, 4, and 1. So, <2, (8, 4, 1)> forms a 3-star.
6. Node 8 has edges with nodes 11, 2, and 12. So, <8, (11, 2, 12)> forms a 3-star.
7. Node 4 has edges with nodes 5, 11, and 2. So, <4, (5, 11, 2)> forms a 3-star.
8. Node 12 has edges with nodes 9, 10, and 11. So, <12, (9, 10, 11)> forms a 3-star.
9. Node 1 has edges with nodes 11, 2, and 8. So, <1, (11, 2, 8)> forms a 3-star.
10. Node 3 has edges with nodes 5, 10, and 7. So, <3, (5, 10, 7)> forms a 3-star.
11. Node 7 has edges with nodes 5, 9, and 8. So, <7, (5, 9, 8)> forms a 3-star.
12. Node 13 has edges with nodes 9, 11, and 2. So, <13, (9, 11, 2)> forms a 3-star.

Now, we list the 3-stars found above: <5, (6, 4, 3)>, <9, (10, 7, 13)>, <10, (9, 3, 6)>, <6, (5, 10, 14)>, <2, (8, 4, 1)>, <8, (11, 2, 12)>, <4, (5, 11, 2)>, <12, (9, 10, 11)>, <1, (11, 2, 8)>, <3, (5, 10, 7)>, <7, (5, 9, 8)>, <13, (9, 11, 2)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
