Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to the center of a 3-star.

For each node, count how many edges it has. The nodes with exactly 3 edges are potential center nodes for a 3-star.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 4 (connected to 7, 12, 9)
- Node 7 (connected to 4, 0, 11)
- Node 10 (connected to 7, 11, 6)
- Node 11 (connected to 7, 10, 3)
- Node 8 (connected to 7, 11, 9)
- Node 13 (connected to 12, 2, 1)
- Node 5 (connected to 7, 6, 2)
- Node 0 (connected to 7)
- Node 14 (connected to 1, 9, 2)

Next, let's find the 3-stars. We consider each potential center node and check if it forms a 3-star.

There are 2 unique 3-stars:
- <4, (7, 12, 9)>
- <7, (4, 0, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.
