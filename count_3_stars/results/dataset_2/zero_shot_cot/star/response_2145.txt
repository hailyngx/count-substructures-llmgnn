Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected leaves for each 3-star configuration. 

From the given edges, let's list the 3-star configurations:

<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 12, 14)>
<3, (1, 2, 12)>
<4, (2, 7, 10)>
<5, (1, 4, 13)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 11)>
<8, (6, 12, 13)>
<9, (6, 11, 13)>
<10, (4, 12, 14)>
<11, (0, 7, 9)>
<12, (3, 10, 8)>
<13, (5, 8, 9)>
<14, (1, 2, 14)>

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (3, 12, 14)>, <3, (1, 2, 12)>, <4, (2, 7, 10)>, <5, (1, 4, 13)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 11)>, <8, (6, 12, 13)>, <9, (6, 11, 13)>, <10, (4, 12, 14)>, <11, (0, 7, 9)>, <12, (3, 10, 8)>, <13, (5, 8, 9)>, <14, (1, 2, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
