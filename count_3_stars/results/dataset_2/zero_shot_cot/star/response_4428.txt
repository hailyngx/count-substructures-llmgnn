Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.

- Node 3 has edges with nodes 15, 21, 16, 8, and 18. Since it has exactly 3 edges (15, 21, 16), <3, (15, 21, 16)> is a 3-star.
- Node 15 has edges with nodes 3, 7, 25, and 24. Since it has exactly 3 edges (3, 7, 25), <15, (3, 7, 25)> is a 3-star.
- Node 0 and Node 29 both have edges with nodes 27, 17, 13, and 6. However, neither has exactly 3 edges connected to it, so there are no 3-stars involving these nodes.
- Node 8 and Node 23 both have edges with nodes 3, 16, 2, and 16. Only Node 8 has exactly 3 edges (3, 16, 2), so <8, (3, 16, 2)> is a 3-star.
- Node 7 and Node 12 both have edges with nodes 15, 20, 28, and 29. However, neither has exactly 3 edges connected to it, so there are no 3-stars involving these nodes.
- Node 17 has edges with nodes 0, 29, 2, and 4. Since it has exactly 3 edges (0, 29, 2), <17, (0, 29, 2)> is a 3-star.
- Node 23 has edges with nodes 8, 11, 26, and 5. Since it has exactly 3 edges (8, 11, 26), <23, (8, 11, 26)> is a 3-star.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 26, 4, 23, and 19. Since it has exactly 3 edges (26, 4, 23), <1, (26, 4, 23)> is a 3-star.
- Node 10 and Node 28 both have edges with nodes 2, 14, 10, and 12. However, neither has exactly 3 edges connected to it, so there are no 3-stars involving these nodes.
- Node 25 has edges with nodes 15, 27, 19, and 22. Since it has exactly 3 edges (15, 27, 19), <25, (15, 27, 19)> is a 3-star.
- Node 26 has edges with nodes 23, 1, 13, and 16. Since it has exactly 3 edges (23, 1, 13), <26, (23, 1, 13)> is a 3-star.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 23, 18, 9, and 6. Since it has exactly 3 edges (23, 18, 6), <5, (23, 18, 6)> is a 3-star.
- Node 13 has edges with nodes 0, 26, 9, and 16. Since it has exactly 3 edges (0, 26, 16), <13, (0, 26, 16)> is a 3-star.
- Node 11 has edges with nodes 23, 9, 26, and 24. Since it has exactly 3 edges (23, 9, 24), <11, (23, 9, 24)> is a 3-star.
- Node 19 has edges with nodes 25, 4, 0, and 0. Since it has exactly 3 edges (25, 4, 0), <19, (25, 4, 0)> is a 3-star.
- Node 20 has edges with nodes 12, 18, 18, and 0. Since it has exactly 3 edges (12, 18, 18), <20, (12, 18, 18)> is a 3-star.
- Node 22 has edges with nodes 25, 6, 25, and 0. Since it has exactly 3 edges (25, 6, 0), <22, (25, 6, 0)> is a 3-star.
- Node 6 and Node 24 both have edges with nodes 0, 22, 24, and 9. However, neither has exactly 3 edges connected to it, so there are no 3-stars involving these nodes.
- Node 16 has edges with nodes 3, 8, 21, and 26. Since it has exactly 3 edges (3, 8, 21), <16, (3, 8, 21)> is a 3-star.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 17, 1, 19, and 4. Since it has exactly 3 edges (17, 1, 19), <4, (17, 1, 19)> is a 3-star.
- Node 18 has edges with nodes 3, 29, 5, and 20. Since it has exactly 3 edges (3, 29, 5), <18, (3, 29, 5)> is a 3-star.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 11, 24, 13, and 24. Since it has exactly 3 edges (11, 24, 24), <9, (11, 24, 24)> is a 3-star.

Count of 3-stars: [10]
Unique 3-stars: <3, (15, 21, 16)>, <8, (3, 16, 2)>, <17, (0, 29, 2)>, <23, (8, 11, 26)>, <1, (26, 4, 23)>, <25, (15, 27, 19)>, <26, (23, 1, 13)>, <5, (23, 18, 6)>, <13, (0, 26, 16)>, <19, (25, 4, 0)>
