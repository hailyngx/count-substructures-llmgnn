Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected in a way that forms a 3-star. 

Initially, we will identify the nodes with degree 3, as they have the potential to be centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with degree 3: 1, 2, 4, 6

Next, we will check these nodes to see if they are indeed centers of 3-stars by looking at the edges connected to them.

Nodes with degree 3 that are centers of 3-stars: 2, 4

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (4, 7, 5)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
