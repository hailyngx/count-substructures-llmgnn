Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9: <0, (1, 5, 9)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 14: <1, (0, 6, 14)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 14: <2, (7, 11, 14)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 13: <3, (7, 12, 13)>
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 12: <4, (8, 9, 12)>
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 9, and 13: <7, (2, 9, 13)>
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 14: <8, (4, 11, 14)>
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 13: <9, (0, 4, 13)>
9. Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 11, and 14: <10, (5, 11, 14)>
10. Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 10, and 13: <11, (2, 10, 13)>
11. Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8: <12, (3, 4, 8)>
12. Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9: <13, (3, 7, 9)>
13. Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8: <14, (1, 2, 8)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we count the unique combinations mentioned above. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
