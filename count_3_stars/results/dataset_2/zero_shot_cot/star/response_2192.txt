Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 2) (3, 12) (11, 19) (0, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 17) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 16) (16, 17) (16, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (7, 14, 18)>
<9, (2, 6, 18)>
<14, (5, 6, 7)>
<17, (4, 7, 14)>
<6, (9, 12, 13)>
<2, (8, 12, 15)>
<12, (3, 6, 10)>
<18, (5, 9, 10)>
<19, (1, 11, 15)>
<4, (15, 17, 19)>
<13, (1, 6, 16)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars we found: [10].
