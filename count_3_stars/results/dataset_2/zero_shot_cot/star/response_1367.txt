Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes can be potential centers of 3-star graphs.
1. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 12), (6, 4)
2. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 1), (9, 7)
3. Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 8)
4. Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 11)
5. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 11), (7, 14)
6. Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 13), (8, 2)
7. Node 13: (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 11), (13, 14)
8. Node 10: (10, 4), (10, 12), (10, 5)
9. Node 11: (11, 4), (11, 7), (11, 13), (11, 2)
10. Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 10)
11. Node 2: (2, 8), (2, 11), (2, 14)

Count the number of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]

List of unique 3-stars: 
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<4, (3, 7, 10)>
<7, (9, 0, 14)>
<8, (9, 1, 13)>
<13, (8, 5, 11)>
<10, (4, 12, 5)>
<11, (4, 7, 13)>
<5, (6, 13, 10)>
<2, (8, 11, 14)>
<12, (6, 10, 0)>
