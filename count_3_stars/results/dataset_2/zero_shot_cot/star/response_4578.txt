Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
