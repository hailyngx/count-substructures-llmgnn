Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 2)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
