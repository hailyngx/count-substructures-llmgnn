Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 28) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 11) (22, 28) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 5) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 15) (9, 26) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 0) (26, 17) (23, 22) (23, 20) (20, 23) (20, 0) (20, 24) (25, 16) (25, 15) (25, 14) (0, 26) (0, 20) (0, 12) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 24) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 27) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 5) (18, 4) (28, 13) (28, 22) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 7) (3, 21) (3, 29) (10, 16) (8, 29) (29, 1) (29, 3) (29, 8) (29, 15) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 28) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 7) (11, 27) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 10) (16, 17) (17, 26) (17, 16) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 20) (24, 5) (24, 12) (27, 6) (27, 11) (14, 25) (14, 4) (14, 15) (15, 21) (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 14) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 21, 29)>
<21, (1, 15, 28)>
<9, (4, 7, 26)>
<26, (0, 9, 17)>
<16, (10, 17, 25)>
<15, (14, 21, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
