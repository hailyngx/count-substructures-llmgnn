Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

<[5, (9, 6, 12)]>  
<[1, (9, 3, 4)]>  
<[3, (1, 6, 14)]>  
<[0, (6, 14, 11)]>  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
