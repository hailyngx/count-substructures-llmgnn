Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 6) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 7) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 0) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 13) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 0) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 19) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
We can find the 3-stars in the given graph by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:
1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are potential central nodes of 3-stars.

From the given edges, the potential central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 
- Node 3, connected to nodes 5, 12, and 15
- Node 10, connected to nodes 9, 14, and 15
- Node 18, connected to nodes 0, 2, and 11
- Node 14, connected to nodes 4, 6, and 15
- Node 17, connected to nodes 4, 5, and 16
- Node 13, connected to nodes 1, 4, and 19

2. For each potential central node, confirm if the connected nodes are not already connected between each other.

From the potential 3-star central nodes, we can construct the following 3-stars:
<Point 1>: <3, (5, 12, 15)>
<Point 2>: <10, (9, 14, 15)>
<Point 3>: <18, (0, 2, 11)>
<Point 4>: <14, (4, 6, 15)>
<Point 5>: <17, (4, 5, 16)>
<Point 6>: <13, (1, 4, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
