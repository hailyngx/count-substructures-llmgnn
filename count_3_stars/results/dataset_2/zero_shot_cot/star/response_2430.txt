Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3. These nodes have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

Node 6 has degree 3: (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0)
Node 0 also has degree 3: (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 1)

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

<6, (3, 2, 0)>
<0, (5, 7, 1)>

There are 2 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [2].
