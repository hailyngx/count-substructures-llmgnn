Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph based on the given information.

The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 11, 7)>
<1, (5, 11, 8)>
<2, (8, 3, 7)>
<3, (9, 10, 13)>
<4, (5, 10, 12)>
<5, (9, 1, 11)>
<6, (10, 7, 3)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (11, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>
<10, (4, 3, 6)>
<11, (5, 8, 1)>
<12, (4, 8, 12)>
<13, (3, 14, 0)>
<14, (4, 12, 13)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
