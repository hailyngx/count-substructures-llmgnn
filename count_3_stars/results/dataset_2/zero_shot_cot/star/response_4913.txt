Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 27) (22, 11) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 1) (21, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (3, 20) (25, 18) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 29) (11, 22) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 0) (15, 17) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 7) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 16) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 23) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (28, 16) (28, 18) (28, 23) (16, 19) (16, 28) (16, 27) (18, 25) (18, 26) (18, 28) (4, 10) (4, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (23, 26) (23, 28) (5, 1) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 9) (9, 11) (9, 20) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 24) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 24) (27, 22) (27, 19) (27, 16) (29, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <22, (13, 19, 27)>
2. <1, (21, 5, 22)>
3. <21, (13, 1, 2)>
4. <14, (17, 11, 6)>
5. <17, (14, 8, 15)>
6. <20, (3, 8, 9)>
7. <8, (17, 2, 7)>
8. <19, (22, 26, 16)>
9. <26, (19, 18, 23)>
10. <7, (14, 10, 8)>
11. <12, (2, 7, 0)>
12. <16, (19, 28, 27)>
13. <18, (25, 26, 28)>
14. <4, (10, 9, 4)>
15. <6, (14, 12, 7)>
16. <23, (26, 28, 23)>
17. <24, (10, 0, 9)>

Therefore, there are total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
