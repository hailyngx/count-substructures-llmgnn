Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 18) (13, 10) (13, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 3) (15, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 15) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present.

Let's list the 3-stars by looking at each node as the potential central node and checking if it is connected to exactly three other nodes:
- <0, (5, 14, 2)>
- <1, (17, 7, 16)>
- <2, (5, 0, 19)>
- <3, (9, 17, 18)>
- <4, (9, 8, 16)>
- <5, (9, 17, 0)>
- <6, (9, 10, 8)>
- <7, (12, 1, 16)>
- <8, (9, 6, 4)>
- <9, (5, 6, 4)>
- <10, (6, 11, 13)>
- <11, (10, 12, 13)>
- <12, (11, 7, 16)>
- <13, (10, 11, 8)>
- <14, (5, 0, -)>
- <15, (2, - , -)>
- <16, (4, 1, 19)>
- <17, (5, 1, 3)>
- <18, (9, 8, 3)>
- <19, (8, 16, 2)>

There are a total of 18 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
