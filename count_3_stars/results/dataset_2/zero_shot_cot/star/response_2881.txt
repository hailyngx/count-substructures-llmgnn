Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3 as they have the potential to be the central node of a 3-star graph. 
In this graph, the nodes with degree 3 are 5, 9, 3, and 4.

Now we will check each of these nodes and see if they can form a 3-star graph.

For node 5:
- (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7)

For node 9:
- (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 4)

For node 3:
- (3, 5), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 8)

For node 4:
- (4, 9), (4, 3), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 0)

We can now count the number of 3-stars formed by each central node:
- For node 5, there are 5 possible 3-stars.
- For node 9, there are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 3, there are 5 possible 3-stars.
- For node 4, there are 5 possible 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 2, 3)>, <5, (2, 0, 7)>, <5, (3, 7, 0)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (7, 9, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 5)>, <9, (8, 5, 4)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 2)>, <4, (3, 9, 0)>
