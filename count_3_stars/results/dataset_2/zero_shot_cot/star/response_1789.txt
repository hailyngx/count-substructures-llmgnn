Response:
The 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify all the nodes and their connections in the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to: 20, 16, 29, 26
- Node 1 is connected to: 6, 14
- Node 2 is connected to: 6, 11
- Node 3 is connected to: 9, 21, 29
- Node 4 is connected to: 9, 5, 19
- Node 5 is connected to: 23, 4
- Node 6 is connected to: 9, 1, 15, 2
- Node 7 is connected to: 12, 25, 14, 27
- Node 8 is connected to: 28, 10, 25
- Node 9 is connected to: 6, 4, 21, 3
- Node 10 is connected to: 8, 16, 27, 22
- Node 11 is connected to: 2
- Node 12 is connected to: 7, 29
- Node 13 is connected to: 23, 14
- Node 14 is connected to: 13, 7, 1
- Node 15 is connected to: 6, 20, 28
- Node 16 is connected to: 0, 22, 10
- Node 17 is connected to: 19, 22
- Node 18 is connected to: 28, 23
- Node 19 is connected to: 25, 4, 17
- Node 20 is connected to: 0, 15, 28, 27
- Node 21 is connected to: 9, 3
- Node 22 is connected to: 25, 16, 17, 10
- Node 23 is connected to: 13, 5, 18
- Node 24 is connected to: 29
- Node 25 is connected to: 8, 7, 26, 19, 22
- Node 26 is connected to: 0, 25, 29
- Node 27 is connected to: 20, 7, 10
- Node 28 is connected to: 8, 20, 15, 18
- Node 29 is connected to: 0, 12, 3, 26, 24

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars:

<0, (20, 15, 28)>
<1, (6, 14, 7)>
<2, (6, 11, 2)>
<3, (9, 21, 29)>
<4, (9, 5, 19)>
<5, (23, 4, 5)>
<6, (9, 1, 15)>
<7, (12, 25, 14)>
<8, (28, 10, 25)>
<9, (6, 4, 21)>
<10, (8, 16, 27)>
<11, (2, 11, 0)>
<12, (7, 29, 3)>
<13, (23, 18, 14)>
<14, (13, 7, 1)>
<15, (20, 28, 15)>
<16, (0, 22, 10)>
<17, (19, 22, 17)>
<18, (28, 15, 23)>
<19, (25, 4, 17)>
<20, (0, 15, 28)>
<21, (9, 3, 21)>
<22, (25, 16, 17)>
<23, (13, 5, 18)>
<24, (29, 26, 0)>
<25, (8, 7, 26)>
<26, (0, 25, 29)>
<27, (20, 10, 28)>
<28, (15, 18, 23)>
<29, (29, 24, 26)>

There are 28 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].
