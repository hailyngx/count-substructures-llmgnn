Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 11) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (the leaves). 

Here are the nodes with their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 7
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 6
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 6
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 6

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 10)>
<3, (7, 8, 12)>
<4, (6, 9, 14)>
<5, (0, 7, 11)>
<6, (2, 4, 12)>
<7, (0, 8, 14)>
<9, (4, 11, 14)>
<10, (1, 3, 9)>
<11, (2, 5, 6)>
<12, (3, 8, 13)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [10].
