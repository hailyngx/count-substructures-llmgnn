Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the possible 3-star structures in the graph based on the given edges:
1. Nodes connected to node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 7)
2. Nodes connected to node 9: (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 0)
3. Nodes connected to node 4: (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3)
4. Nodes connected to node 7: (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 8)
5. Nodes connected to node 1: (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 2)
6. Nodes connected to node 3: (3, 4), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2)
7. Nodes connected to node 6: (6, 5), (6, 8)
8. Nodes connected to node 8: (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 0)
9. Nodes connected to node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 0)
10. Nodes connected to node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 2)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- The possible 3-star structures occur around each of the 10 nodes. However, not all these structures form 3-stars (i.e., one central node and three leaves connected to it).
- By observation, we find that the 3-star structures that form 3-stars in the given graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, <7, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, and <3, (4, 1, 0)>.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
Final answer: [6]
