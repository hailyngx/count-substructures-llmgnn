Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by looking for central nodes, and then counting the number of 3-stars. 

Central nodes of a 3-star graph should satisfy the following criteria:
1. The degree of the central node is 3.
2. The neighboring nodes of the central node are not connected to each other.

Let's start with the initial count of 3-stars and then we will list the unique ones.

Initial count: [1]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 8, 12)>
<9, (6, 4, 13)>
<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<4, (9, 6, 13)>
<7, (4, 11, 10)>
<8, (5, 0, 12)>
<13, (9, 4, 10)> 
<10, (6, 7, 11)>
<11, (7, 10, 3)>
<0, (5, 8, 10)>
<14, (6, 0, 1)>
<3, (4, 10, 11)>
<2, (11, 14, 3)>
<12, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (12, 14, 11)>

Final count: [15]
