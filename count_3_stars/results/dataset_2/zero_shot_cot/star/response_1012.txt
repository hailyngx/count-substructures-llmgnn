Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
Based on the given edges, the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are: 5, 9, 4, 1, and 3.

Step 2: Enumerate 3-stars for each central node.
For the central node 5: <5, (9, 4, 3)>
For the central node 9: <9, (5, 2, 3)>
For the central node 4: <4, (5, 0, 1)>
For the central node 1: <1, (4, 7, 3)>
For the central node 3: <3, (5, 9, 1)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
We found 5 unique 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
