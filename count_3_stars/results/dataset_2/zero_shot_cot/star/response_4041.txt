Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph.
Nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 6, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6, 7, 2
- Node 5: 0, 4, 8
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8: 1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 0
- Node 9: 0, 2, 6, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 8, 0)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 8, 0)>, <6, (2, 9, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 5)>
- Node 7: <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (4, 8, 5)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 5, 0)>, <8, (4, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 0, 4)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 6, 0)>, <9, (6, 0, 1)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
