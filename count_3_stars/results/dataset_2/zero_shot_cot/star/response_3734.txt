Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 23) (22, 27) (22, 6) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (23, 18) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 27) (1, 8) (26, 3) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 0) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 25) (17, 8) (17, 13) (4, 12) (4, 29) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 4) (12, 29) (5, 26) (5, 20) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 14) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 21) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 2) (29, 4) (29, 12) (29, 19) (7, 23) (7, 28) (7, 24) (20, 26) (20, 5) (20, 9) (20, 16) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 21) (27, 22) (27, 23) (25, 28) (25, 16) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 7) (6, 22) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 20) (9, 10) (2, 14) (16, 20) (16, 25) (16, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

Nodes with 3 connections: 
- 0, 12, 14, 16, 19, 28, 29

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

<3, (12, 18, 26)>
<8, (1, 13, 17)>
<12, (3, 22, 29)>
<14, (2, 19, 24)>
<16, (9, 20, 25)>
<19, (14, 18, 29)>
<28, (7, 21, 25)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
