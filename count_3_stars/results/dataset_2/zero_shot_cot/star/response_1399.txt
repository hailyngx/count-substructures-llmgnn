Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of potential 3-stars.

The nodes with three edges connected to them are: 5, 9, 1, 4, 8, 13, 10, and 2.

Next, let's look for 3-stars around each of these nodes.

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, 12, 11.
- Among these, only node 9 has exactly three connections (5, 9, 11).
- So, there is one 3-star around node 5: <5, (9, 11, *)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 14, 10, 13, 0.
- Among these, only nodes 5, 13, 10 form a 3-star with 9: <9, (5, 13, 10)>.
  
For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 13, 4, 12.
- Among these, only nodes 3, 10, 13 form a 3-star with 1: <1, (3, 10, 13)>.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, 10, 2.
- Among these, only nodes 1, 3, 10 form a 3-star with 4: <4, (1, 3, 10)>.

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 4, 14, 7.
- Among these, only nodes 5, 13, 4 form a 3-star with 8: <8, (5, 13, 4)>.

For node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 8, 7.
- Among these, only nodes 9, 1, 8 form a 3-star with 13: <13, (9, 1, 8)>.

For node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 4, 6, 2.
- Among these, only nodes 9, 1, 4 form a 3-star with 10: <10, (9, 1, 4)>.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 10.
- Among these, only node 4 has exactly three connections (2, 4, 10).
- So, there is one 3-star around node 2: <2, (4, 7, 10)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
