Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-star structures in this graph:

1. Central Node: 4
   Leaves: 7, 8, 0
   <4, (7, 8, 0)>

2. Central Node: 7
   Leaves: 4, 14, 5
   <7, (4, 14, 5)>

3. Central Node: 6
   Leaves: 4, 5, 3
   <6, (4, 5, 3)>

4. Central Node: 9
   Leaves: 14, 3, 0
   <9, (14, 3, 0)>

5. Central Node: 11
   Leaves: 10, 13, 5
   <11, (10, 13, 5)>

6. Central Node: 8
   Leaves: 4, 13, 2
   <8, (4, 13, 2)>

7. Central Node: 5
   Leaves: 7, 6, 11
   <5, (7, 6, 11)>

8. Central Node: 2
   Leaves: 11, 8, 13
   <2, (11, 8, 13)>

9. Central Node: 0
   Leaves: 4, 9, 8
   <0, (4, 9, 8)>

10. Central Node: 14
    Leaves: 7, 9, 1
    <14, (7, 9, 1)>

11. Central Node: 3
    Leaves: 6, 9, 11
    <3, (6, 9, 11)>

12. Central Node: 12
    Leaves: 6, 13, 5
    <12, (6, 13, 5)>

13. Central Node: 1
    Leaves: 7, 10, 2
    <1, (7, 10, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
