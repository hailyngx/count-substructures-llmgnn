Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (12, 9) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 edges (leaves) connected to it. Let's go through the nodes one by one:

- Node 0 has 4 edges connected to it: (0, 13), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 11).
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected to it: (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 2).
- Node 2 has 5 edges connected to it: (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 14), (2, 11), (2, 0).
- Node 3 has 5 edges connected to it: (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 10).
- Node 4 has 5 edges connected to it: (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 11), (4, 3).
- Node 5 has 2 edges connected to it: (5, 7), (5, 10).
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected to it: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 14), (6, 3).
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 10), (7, 8).
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected to it: (8, 7), (8, 13), (8, 2).
- Node 9 has 5 edges connected to it: (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 11), (9, 1), (9, 12).
- Node 10 has 4 edges connected to it: (10, 7), (10, 14), (10, 5), (10, 3).
- Node 11 has 6 edges connected to it: (11, 9), (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 2), (11, 0), (11, 12).
- Node 12 has 2 edges connected to it: (12, 9), (12, 11).
- Node 13 has 3 edges connected to it: (13, 4), (13, 8), (13, 0).
- Node 14 has 3 edges connected to it: (14, 6), (14, 2), (14, 10).

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (6, 9, 2)>
<2, (0, 14, 6)>
<3, (4, 7, 10)>
<4, (9, 13, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 2)>
<8, (7, 13, 0)>
<10, (7, 14, 5)>
<12, (9, 11, 4)>
<13, (8, 0, 2)>
<14, (6, 2, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
