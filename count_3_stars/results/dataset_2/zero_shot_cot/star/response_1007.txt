Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 25) (27, 11) (27, 7) (27, 5) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 13) (10, 0) (10, 23) (17, 28) (17, 19) (17, 15) (26, 1) (26, 25) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 12) (22, 2) (11, 27) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 29) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 28) (8, 29) (8, 16) (9, 7) (9, 19) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 29) (2, 22) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 4) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 23) (24, 20) (24, 25) (5, 27) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 23) (28, 17) (28, 15) (28, 12) (20, 24) (20, 23) (4, 15) (4, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 18) (25, 0) (25, 26) (25, 24) (25, 6) (25, 18) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 21) (29, 12) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 13) (18, 25) (12, 14) (12, 21) (12, 28) (12, 29) (7, 27) (7, 9) (7, 2) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 6) (23, 20) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 10, and 25.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 26, and 13.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 13.
4. Node 11 is connected to nodes 27, 3, and 18.
5. Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 21, and 28.
6. Node 15 is connected to nodes 17, 18, and 4.
7. Node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 2, and 19.
8. Node 23 is connected to nodes 10, 16, and 6.
9. Node 25 is connected to nodes 0, 26, and 24.
10. Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 15, and 13.
11. Node 29 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 21.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

- <0, (14, 10, 25)>
- <1, (3, 26, 13)>
- <3, (1, 11, 13)>
- <11, (27, 3, 18)>
- <12, (14, 21, 28)>
- <15, (17, 18, 4)>
- <16, (8, 2, 19)>
- <23, (10, 16, 6)>
- <25, (0, 26, 24)>
- <18, (11, 15, 13)>
- <29, (11, 8, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
