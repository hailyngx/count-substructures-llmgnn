- Node 13 is connected to nodes 22, 5, and 6.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 13, 23, and 2.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 23, and 16.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 29, 26, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 2, and 4.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 26.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 22, 15, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 15, 23, and 19.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 20, 8, and 27.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 23, 14, and 28.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 12, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 14, and 26.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 27, 19, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 16.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 15, 5, and 2.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 22, 3, and 16.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 18, 10, and 29.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 20, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 29.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 27, 1, and 8.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 21, 5, and 18.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 14 and 11.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 21, 26, 18, and 29.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, 9, and 8.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 17.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 11 and 24.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 22, 20, and 17.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 25 and 26.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. Let's denote the 3-star structures as <central node, (leaf node 1, leaf node 2, leaf node 3)>:
- <13, (22, 5, 6)>
- <22, (13, 23, 2)>
- <15, (7, 23, 16)>
- <27, (29, 26, 6)>
- <3, (25, 2, 4)>
- <25, (3, 4, 26)>
- <23, (22, 15, 7)>
- <7, (15, 23, 19)>
- <21, (20, 8, 27)>
- <0, (23, 14, 28)>
- <14, (0, 12, 19)>
- <19, (7, 14, 26)>
- <26, (27, 19, 8)>
- <5, (13, 11, 16)>
- <16, (15, 5, 2)>
- <18, (9, 20, 8)>
- <29, (27, 1, 8)>
- <20, (21, 5, 18)>
- <11, (5, 12, 17)>
- <24, (22, 20, 17)>
- <8, (21, 26, 18)> (repeated)
- <10, (14, 9, 8)>
- <17, (11, 24, 17)>
- <9, (18, 10, 29)>
- <12, (14, 11, 12)>

There are [26] 3-star structures in the given graph.
