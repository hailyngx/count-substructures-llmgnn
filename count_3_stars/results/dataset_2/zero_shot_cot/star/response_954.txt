Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 13) (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Starting with node 0:
   - <0, (6, 7, 8)> (3-star centered at 0)

2. Moving on to node 1:
   - <1, (3, 11, 12)> (3-star centered at 1)
   
3. Node 2:
   - <2, (4, 12, 13)> (3-star centered at 2)

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (1, 11, 13)> (3-star centered at 3)

5. Node 4:
   - <4, (2, 9, 14)> (3-star centered at 4)

6. Node 5:
   - <5, (1, 2, 8)> (3-star centered at 5)

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (0, 7, 10)> (3-star centered at 6)
   
8. Node 7:
   - <7, (0, 6, 12)> (3-star centered at 7)

9. Node 8:
   - <8, (0, 5, 9)> (3-star centered at 8)

10. Node 9:
   - <9, (4, 8, 14)> (3-star centered at 9)

11. Node 10:
   - <10, (6, 13, 6)> (3-star centered at 10)

12. Node 11:
   - <11, (1, 3, 14)> (3-star centered at 11)

13. Node 12:
   - <12, (2, 7, 6)> (3-star centered at 12)

14. Node 13:
   - <13, (3, 0, 2)> (3-star centered at 13)

15. Node 14:
   - <14, (0, 4, 9)> (3-star centered at 14)

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars identified above, we get a total of 15 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
