Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 19) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 10) (2, 16) (2, 7) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 1) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 0) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 19) (4, 17) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 10) (14, 7) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 19) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Step 1: List the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree 3 nodes)
- From the given edges, the nodes connected to a center node are:
  - Center node: 0, Degree 3 nodes: 1, 3, 18
  - Center node: 2, Degree 3 nodes: 7, 10, 16
  - Center node: 6, Degree 3 nodes: 4, 7, 19
  - Center node: 9, Degree 3 nodes: 5, 13, 15

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars
- Now we can identify the 3-stars based on the center node and its degree 3 nodes:
  - <0, (1, 3, 18)>
  - <2, (7, 10, 16)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 19)>
  - <9, (5, 13, 15)>

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars
- Counting the unique 3-stars found: 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
