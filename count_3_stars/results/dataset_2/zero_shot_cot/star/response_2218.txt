Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (12, 14) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 9) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 17) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three incident edges, as these could be potential central nodes of 3-stars. 

- Node 4 has incident edges (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 15).
- Node 7 has incident edges (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 1).
- Node 8 has incident edges (8, 16), (8, 11).
- Node 3 has incident edges (3, 11), (3, 17), (3, 18).
- Node 16 has incident edges (16, 8), (16, 15), (16, 10).
- Node 2 has incident edges (2, 7), (2, 10), (2, 0).
- Node 0 has incident edges (0, 2), (0, 18), (0, 1).
- Node 10 has incident edges (10, 16), (10, 2), (10, 18).
- Node 17 has incident edges (17, 3), (17, 11), (17, 15).
- Node 9 has incident edges (9, 4), (9, 19), (9, 14).
- Node 14 has incident edges (14, 5), (14, 19), (14, 12).

From the above analysis, the potential central nodes of 3-stars are 4, 7, 16, 0, 10, and 14.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:

- For node 4: (4, 7, 2), (4, 9, 19), and (4, 15, 16).
- For node 7: (7, 4, 1), (7, 2, 10), and (7, 1, 0).
- For node 16: (16, 8, 11) and (16, 15, 17).
- For node 0: (0, 2, 1) and (0, 18, 17).
- For node 10: (10, 16, 2) and (10, 18, 17).
- For node 14: (14, 5, 19) and (14, 19, 9).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

Unique 3-stars: <4, (7, 2, 10)>, <4, (9, 19, 15)>, <4, (15, 16, 17)>, <7, (1, 2, 10)>, <0, (1, 2, 18)>, and <14, (5, 9, 19)>
