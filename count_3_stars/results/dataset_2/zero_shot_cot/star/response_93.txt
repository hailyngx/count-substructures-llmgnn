Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- From node 0: (0, 7, 8, 13)
- From node 1: (1, 3, 7, 9)
- From node 2: (2, 4, 5, 8)
- From node 3: (3, 1, 9, 10)
- From node 5: (5, 0, 6, 8)
- From node 6: (6, 5, 12, 14)
- From node 9: (9, 2, 7, 13)
- From node 13: (13, 6, 9, 14)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get:
<0, 7, 8, 13>, <1, 3, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 5, 8>, <6, 5, 12, 14>, <9, 2, 7, 13> [5]
