Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 2) (6, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (8, 1, 9)>
<1, (11, 5, 12)>
<2, (10, 13, 14)>
<3, (11, 7, 14)>
<4, (10, 8, 9)>
<5, (10, 8, 12)>
<6, (2, 14, 6)>
<7, (11, 3, 9)>
<8, (10, 4, 5)>
<9, (11, 4, 7)>
<10, (2, 4, 5)>
<11, (1, 3, 9)>
<12, (5, 1, 12)>
<13, (2, 8, 14)>
<14, (2, 3, 13)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find there are [<14>] 3-stars in total.
