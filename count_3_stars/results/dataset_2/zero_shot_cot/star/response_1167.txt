Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 0, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 5 as the center.  
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center.  
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 4. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center.  
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 8. This forms two 3-stars: one with node 4 as the center and one with node 8 as the center. (We only consider the 3-star with node 4 as the center since it has the higher degree.)  
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, and 1. This forms a 3-star with node 7 as the center.  

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<5, (2, 4, 0, 7)>  
<9, (6, 3, 7)>  
<6, (9, 2, 4)>  
<7, (5, 9, 4, 1)>
