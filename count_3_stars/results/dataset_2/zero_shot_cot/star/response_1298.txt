Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Start by listing all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 6, 8, and 0)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 5, 2, and 7)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 9, 4, and 2)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 9, 4, and 8)

2. Counting the number of 3-stars:
- <5, (6, 8, 0)>
- <6, (5, 9, 7)>
- <0, (5, 2, 7)>
- <7, (5, 6, 2)>
- <1, (9, 4, 2)>
- <3, (9, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
