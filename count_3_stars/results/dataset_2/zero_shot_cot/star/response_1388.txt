Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (2, 11) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step to find all such 3-stars:

1. Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9. <11, (3, 5, 9)>
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 14. <4, (3, 9, 14)>
3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9. <8, (3, 7, 9)>
4. Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 1. <13, (0, 5, 1)>
5. Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 13. <14, (3, 6, 13)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
