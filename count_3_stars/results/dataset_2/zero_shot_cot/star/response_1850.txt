Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 10) (15, 12) (27, 11) (27, 1) (27, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 21) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 24) (7, 13) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 2) (25, 4) (25, 3) (25, 16) (18, 22) (18, 9) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 29) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 10) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 28) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 5) (29, 22) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 14) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 3) (14, 29) (14, 0) (26, 22) (26, 11) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 5) (21, 4) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 19) (19, 21) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 22) (6, 27) (6, 22) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 20) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 0) (5, 28) (5, 11) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 24) (12, 9) (12, 20) (20, 21) (20, 24) (20, 12) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 1
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 5
- Node 22: degree 5
- Node 26: degree 2
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

Identifying the 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors 3, 8, and 13 <2, (3, 8, 13)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 14, and 25 <3, (2, 14, 25)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors 22, 27, and 29 <6, (22, 27, 29)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 13, and 28 <8, (2, 13, 28)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors 2, 7, and 9 <13, (2, 7, 9)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 22, and 25 <16, (7, 22, 25)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <<2, (3, 8, 13)>, <3, (2, 14, 25)>, <6, (22, 27, 29)>, <8, (2, 13, 28)>, <13, (2, 7, 9)>, <16, (7, 22, 25)>>
