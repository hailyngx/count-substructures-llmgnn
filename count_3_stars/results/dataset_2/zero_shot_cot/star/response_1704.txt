Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The graph has the following 3-stars:

<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 7, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
