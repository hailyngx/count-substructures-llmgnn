Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, as they have the potential to be the center of a 3-star graph. 
Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 11

Now, let's check each potential center node to see if they actually form a 3-star graph. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 4. This forms a 3-star.
<0, (10, 12, 4)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 7. This forms a 3-star.
<1, (9, 11, 7)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 4. This forms a 3-star.
<2, (10, 8, 4)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 does not have exactly three neighbors.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 1. This forms a 3-star.
<7, (9, 12, 1)>

For node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and neither 7 nor 13. This does not form a 3-star.

Now, counting the total number of unique 3-star graphs found, we have found 3 unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the final answer is [3].
