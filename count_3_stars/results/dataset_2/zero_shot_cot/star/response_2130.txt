Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the graph:
- Node 4 has neighbors 8, 10, and 2.
- Node 8 has neighbors 4, 14, and 11.
- Node 12 has neighbors 2, 14, and 3.
- Node 5 has neighbors 6, 13, and 0.
- Node 14 has neighbors 8, 12, and 5.
- Node 13 has neighbors 5, 11, and 3.
- Node 3 has neighbors 12, 0, and 13.
- Node 11 has neighbors 8, 13, and 9.
- Node 9 has neighbors 12, 11, and 2.
- Node 2 has neighbors 4, 7, and 12.
- Node 10 has neighbors 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 has neighbors 14, 13, and 9.

Now, we can find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star <4, (8, 10, 2)>.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star <5, (6, 13, 0)>.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star <8, (4, 14, 11)>.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star <9, (12, 11, 2)>.
- Node 12 forms a 3-star <12, (2, 14, 3)>.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star <13, (5, 11, 3)>.
- Node 14 forms two 3-stars: <14, (8, 12, 5)> and <14, (1, 13, 9)>.

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the graph, which can be listed as follows inside <>: <4, (8, 10, 2)>, <5, (6, 13, 0)>, <8, (4, 14, 11)>, <9, (12, 11, 2)>, <12, (2, 14, 3)>, <13, (5, 11, 3)>, <14, (8, 12, 5)>.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
