Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 7) (26, 12) (5, 9) (5, 17) (13, 25) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 6) (22, 23) (22, 25) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 16) (4, 23) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (21, 28) (21, 11) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 7) (28, 2) (3, 11) (11, 21) (11, 3) (11, 17) (0, 28) (0, 29) (7, 26) (7, 28) (1, 22) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 19) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 29) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 10) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 18) (10, 20) (27, 9) (27, 4) (12, 26) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 26) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 6) (24, 19) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 29) (2, 4) (2, 28) (2, 16) (2, 17) (25, 13) (25, 22) (16, 13) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 17) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 2) (17, 16) (19, 1) (19, 24) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential centers of the 3-stars. 

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 13
- Node 4
- Node 28
- Node 16

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars with these nodes as centers:

1. Node 13:
<13, (25, 29, 6)>
<13, (25, 29, 16)>
<13, (25, 29, 15)>
Total: 3

2. Node 4:
<4, (23, 27, 2)>
Total: 1

3. Node 28:
<28, (0, 2, 21)>
<28, (0, 2, 7)>
Total: 2

4. Node 16:
<16, (23, 1, 17)>
<16, (23, 1, 13)>
<16, (23, 1, 2)>
Total: 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [3 + 1 + 2 + 3] = [9].
