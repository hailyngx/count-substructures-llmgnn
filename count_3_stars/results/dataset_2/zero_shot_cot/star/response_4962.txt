Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 17) (16, 29) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 13) (10, 9) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 3) (20, 22) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 7) (23, 24) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 21) (21, 11) (21, 12) (21, 28) (28, 20) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 15) (4, 9) (4, 13) (27, 10) (27, 29) (27, 13) (1, 20) (1, 9) (15, 28) (15, 22) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 28) (3, 0) (26, 29) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 1) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 5) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 13) (22, 20) (22, 15) (22, 14) (22, 17) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 22) (29, 16) (29, 27) (29, 26) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (24, 23) (24, 0) (19, 25) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 14) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 27) (13, 14) (6, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <10, (11, 21, 17)>
- <20, (25, 1, 3)>
- <2, (18, 12, 7)>
- <21, (11, 12, 28)>
- <28, (20, 21, 3)>
- <9, (10, 25, 18)>
- <3, (20, 7, 28)>
- <0, (3, 24, 5)>
- <22, (20, 15, 14)>
- <17, (11, 8, 22)>
- <29, (16, 27, 26)>
- <5, (8, 7, 0)>
- <19, (25, 2, 28)>
- <13, (10, 4, 27)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars as listed above.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
