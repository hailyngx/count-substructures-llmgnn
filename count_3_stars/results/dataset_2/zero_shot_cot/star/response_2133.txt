Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<5, (2, 1, 0)>
<5, (7, 3, 1)>
<9, (8, 4, 2)>
<9, (7, 6, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>
<8, (7, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
