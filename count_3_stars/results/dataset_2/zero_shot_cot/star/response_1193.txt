Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7
- Node 7: 1, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 5, 8

Next, let's count the 3-stars by finding nodes that form a 3-star pattern:
1. 3-star with center node 0: (1, 4, 8)
2. 3-star with center node 1: (0, 2, 5)
3. 3-star with center node 2: (1, 5, 6)
4. 3-star with center node 3: (0, 5, 9)
5. 3-star with center node 4: (0, 5, 8)
6. 3-star with center node 5: (1, 3, 9)
7. 3-star with center node 6: (2, 5, 7)
8. 3-star with center node 7: (1, 4, 6)
9. 3-star with center node 8: (0, 4, 9)
10. 3-star with center node 9: (3, 5, 8)

So, there are a total of <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
