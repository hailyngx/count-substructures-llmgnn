Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

Here are the steps to follow:
1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to each of them. These nodes will serve as potential centers for 3-stars.
2. For each potential center, check if the 3 connected nodes form a 3-star configuration.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through the process:

1. Identify potential centers:
   - Node 5 has 5 edges connected.
   - Node 9 has 4 edges connected.
   - Node 4 has 4 edges connected.
   - Node 7 has 4 edges connected.
   - Node 2 has 3 edges connected.
   - Node 8 has 6 edges connected.
   - Node 0 has 2 edges connected.
   - Node 1 has 6 edges connected.
   - Node 6 has 4 edges connected.
   - Node 3 has 3 edges connected.

2. Analyze potential 3-stars:
   - Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 8)> is a valid 3-star.
   - Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 1)> is a valid 3-star.
   - Node 4: <4, (9, 0, 6)> is a valid 3-star.
   - Node 7: <7, (9, 8, 1)> is a valid 3-star.
   - Node 2: Not a potential center for a 3-star.
   - Node 8: <8, (5, 7, 1)> is a valid 3-star.
   - Node 0: Not a potential center for a 3-star.
   - Node 1: <1, (9, 7, 8)> is a valid 3-star.
   - Node 6: Not a potential center for a 3-star.
   - Node 3: Not a potential center for a 3-star.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
   - There are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <9, (5, 4, 1)>, <4, (9, 0, 6)>, <7, (9, 8, 1)>, <8, (5, 7, 1)>.
