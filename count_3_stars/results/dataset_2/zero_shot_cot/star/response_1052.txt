Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 4) (6, 4) (6, 13) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 14) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 8) (26, 7) (8, 26) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 3) (29, 9) (29, 1) (7, 11) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 3) (25, 7) (14, 21) (14, 26) (14, 1) (19, 18) (19, 20) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 22) (4, 1) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 28) (22, 0) (16, 23) (16, 27) (2, 22) (2, 24) (2, 15) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 24) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 15) (5, 8) (5, 20) (5, 28) (5, 27) (27, 16) (27, 5) (27, 23) (0, 21) (0, 22) (12, 10) (12, 3) (17, 24) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 17) (23, 16) (23, 27) (28, 22) (28, 5) (28, 15) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 14, 4, and 29. Since it is only connected to 4 other nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 22, 24, and 15. This creates a 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 22, 24, and 15 as the leaves. <2, (22, 24, 15)>

3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 20, and 28. This creates a 3-star with node 5 as the center and nodes 8, 20, and 28 as the leaves. <5, (8, 20, 28)>

4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 20, 3, and 29. This creates a 3-star with node 9 as the center and nodes 20, 3, and 29 as the leaves. <9, (20, 3, 29)>

5. Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 4. This creates a 3-star with node 11 as the center and nodes 1, 7, and 4 as the leaves. <11, (1, 7, 4)>

6. Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 6, and 21. This creates a 3-star with node 13 as the center and nodes 10, 6, and 21 as the leaves. <13, (10, 6, 21)>

7. Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 21, and 26. This creates a 3-star with node 14 as the center and nodes 1, 21, and 26 as the leaves. <14, (1, 21, 26)>

8. Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 13, and 28. This creates a 3-star with node 15 as the center and nodes 2, 13, and 28 as the leaves. <15, (2, 13, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
