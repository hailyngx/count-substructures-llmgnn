Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 12) (2, 23) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 13) (4, 18) (4, 28) (7, 15) (7, 24) (7, 14) (7, 22) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 17) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 23) (11, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 27) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 24) (17, 29) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 19) (21, 13) (21, 19) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 25) (26, 16) (5, 22) (5, 15) (16, 26) (16, 20) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 22) (19, 20) (22, 7) (22, 5) (22, 19) (22, 0) (23, 2) (23, 10) (23, 24) (13, 29) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 21) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 25) (28, 4) (28, 0) (28, 25) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 5) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 23) (24, 0) (20, 16) (20, 19) (8, 3) (8, 6) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 28) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph as follows:

<2, (29, 12, 23)>
<7, (15, 24, 22)>
<1, (3, 6, 14)>
<3, (1, 12, 27)>
<6, (1, 8, 14)>
<10, (11, 12, 23)>
<18, (4, 15, 13)>
<27, (3, 12, 24)>
<17, (29, 9, 0)>
<21, (13, 19, 19)>
<14, (2, 7, 1)>
<26, (16, 20, 16)>
<5, (22, 15, 5)>
<0, (17, 22, 28)>
<28, (4, 0, 25)>

Therefore, the total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
