Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors. 
- Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 6, 3, 2, 4
- Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 9, 1, 7, 8, 0
- Node 3 has neighbors: 9, 1, 7, 4
- Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 0
- Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 8, 1
- Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 1, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 9, 6, 3, 4, 0, 2
- Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 2, 3, 7
- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 7, 2

From the analysis above, we have the following 3-stars:
<1, (5, 8, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<3, (9, 7, 4)>
<4, (1, 7, 0)>
<5, (8, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
