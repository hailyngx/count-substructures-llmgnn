Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes. 

Let's organize the node connections based on the central nodes:
- Node 0: (9, 5, 2, 7)
- Node 1: (9, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 2: (4, 0)
- Node 3: (1, 5, 7)
- Node 4: (6, 9, 1, 8, 2)
- Node 5: (3, 0, 7)
- Node 6: (9, 7, 8, 4)
- Node 7: (6, 1, 3, 8, 5, 0)
- Node 8: (6, 9, 4, 7)
- Node 9: (6, 4, 8, 1, 0)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 5, 7)>
<1, (9, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 0, ___)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (6, 9, 1)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 4, 8)>
<7, (6, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
