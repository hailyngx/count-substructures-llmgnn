Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 14) (9, 7) (27, 4) (27, 13) (27, 16) (27, 6) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 19) (25, 1) (25, 28) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 4) (28, 25) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 28) (29, 13) (17, 5) (17, 21) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 6) (22, 11) (22, 16) (26, 2) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 8) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 26) (13, 7) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 24) (8, 26) (8, 12) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 1) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 17) (21, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 23) (3, 12) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 16) (1, 25) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 23) (11, 22) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 19) (16, 1) (24, 28) (24, 4) (23, 3) (23, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their connected nodes to determine the 3-stars.
Here are the central nodes along with their connected nodes:
- Node 0: (20, 3, 28, 4)
- Node 1: (25, 28, 14, 16)
- Node 2: (18, 26, 19, 7)
- Node 3: (0, 10, 23, 12)
- Node 4: (27, 0, 19, 24)
- Node 5: (18, 17, 21, 14)
- Node 6: (27, 18, 7)
- Node 7: (9, 2, 13, 6)
- Node 8: (26, 12)
- Node 10: (21, 3, 1)
- Node 12: (8, 3, 23)
- Node 13: (27, 29, 26, 7)
- Node 14: (5, 1)
- Node 16: (22, 19, 1)
- Node 17: (5, 21)
- Node 18: (5, 2, 26, 6)
- Node 19: (20, 2, 4, 16)
- Node 20: (0, 21, 19)
- Node 21: (5, 20, 17, 10)
- Node 22: (11, 16)
- Node 23: (3, 12)
- Node 24: (28, 4)
- Node 25: (1, 28)
- Node 26: (2, 18, 13, 8)
- Node 27: (4, 13, 16, 6)
- Node 28: (25, 0, 29, 24)
- Node 29: (28, 13)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
[<0, (20, 3, 28)>, <1, (25, 28, 14)>, <4, (27, 0, 19)>, <7, (9, 2, 13)>, <16, (22, 19, 1)>, <18, (5, 2, 26)>, <21, (5, 20, 17)>, <26, (2, 18, 13)>, <28, (25, 0, 29)>]

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
