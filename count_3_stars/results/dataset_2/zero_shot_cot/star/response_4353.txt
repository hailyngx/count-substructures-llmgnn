Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 20) (0, 14) (27, 12) (1, 17) (1, 25) (1, 4) (3, 16) (3, 22) (10, 17) (10, 9) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 23) (20, 0) (20, 12) (20, 18) (20, 19) (20, 23) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 21) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 21) (21, 12) (21, 14) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 2) (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 18) (26, 5) (26, 2) (26, 29) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 6) (5, 12) (5, 26) (18, 20) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 16) (19, 20) (19, 18) (19, 29) (24, 11) (24, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 25) (6, 4) (6, 16) (8, 15) (8, 22) (2, 28) (2, 26) (15, 8) (15, 23) (15, 7) (22, 3) (22, 14) (22, 8) (22, 16) (23, 17) (23, 20) (23, 15) (23, 9) (7, 24) (7, 15) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 19) (29, 4) (25, 1) (25, 6) (9, 10) (9, 23) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 29) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 6) (16, 22) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three adjacent nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars that we find in the graph:
<0, (20, 14, 18)>
<1, (17, 4, 25)>
<3, (16, 22, 18)>
<10, (17, 9, 23)>
<27, (12, 20, 21)>
<13, (4, 29, 18)>
<26, (5, 2, 29)>
<8, (15, 22, 8)>
<2, (28, 26, 29)>
<9, (10, 23, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
