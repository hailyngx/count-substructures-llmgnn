Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes are connected to the central node in each potential 3-star. 

From the given edges, we can find the connections for each node: 

- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 7), (2, 0), (2, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 0), (4, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 4)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 0)
- Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 2)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 0), (8, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 7)
- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 4), (0, 2)

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>
<7, (9, 8, 2)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
