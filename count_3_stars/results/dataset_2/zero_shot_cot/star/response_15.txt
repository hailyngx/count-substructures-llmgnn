Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 17) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 6) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 19) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 18) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 2) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (6, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 4) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 1) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (15, 17, 2)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<2, (12, 1, 0)>
<4, (13, 1, 19)>
<5, (9, 1, 16)>
<8, (14, 2, 18)>
<9, (5, 7, 16)>
<10, (3, 4, 12)>
<11, (14, 13, 6)>
<13, (11, 12, 18)>
<14, (17, 8, 11)>
<15, (0, 17, 18)>
<16, (5, 19, 1)>
<17, (15, 14, 0)>
<18, (17, 13, 8)>
<19, (4, 16, 12)>

There are 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
