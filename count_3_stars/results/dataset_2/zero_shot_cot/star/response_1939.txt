Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 4) (27, 16) (27, 10) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 10) (22, 17) (23, 6) (20, 15) (20, 7) (6, 23) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 12) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 14) (21, 28) (21, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 0) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 18) (26, 12) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 28) (4, 2) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 12) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 3) (7, 20) (7, 24) (25, 11) (25, 29) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 10) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 19) (17, 22) (17, 3) (17, 18) (3, 16) (3, 21) (3, 9) (3, 17) (24, 9) (24, 7) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 18) (0, 8) (5, 22) (5, 26) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 26) (12, 1) (18, 26) (18, 17) (18, 29) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its neighboring nodes for each 3-star.
Given that a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can list all the possible 3-stars by examining each node and its neighbors.

Here are all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (8, 14, 26)>
<1, (6, 12, 29)>
<2, (4, 8, 15)>
<3, (9, 16, 17)>
<4, (2, 15, 28)>
<5, (14, 22, 26)>
<6, (1, 12, 23)>
<7, (20, 24, 7)>
<8, (0, 14, 2)>
<9, (3, 14, 24)>
<10, (15, 19, 27)>
<11, (9, 16, 25)>
<12, (1, 6, 26)>
<14, (5, 8, 9)>
<15, (2, 10, 20)>
<16, (3, 11, 27)>
<17, (3, 18, 22)>
<18, (17, 26, 29)>
<19, (8, 10, 27)>
<20, (7, 15, 20)>
<21, (3, 27, 28)>
<22, (14, 17, 28)>
<23, (6, 28, 1)>
<24, (7, 9, 24)>
<25, (11, 25, 29)>
<26, (0, 12, 18)>
<27, (10, 16, 21)>
<28, (4, 22, 23)>
<29, (1, 18, 25)>

Since each 3-star is unique, there are 29 different 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
