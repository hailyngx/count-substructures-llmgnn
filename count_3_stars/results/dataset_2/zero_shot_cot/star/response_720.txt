Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 5) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 4) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 0) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 8) (18, 7) (15, 17) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 13) (3, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (10, 2) 

Response:
Let's find all the possible 3-stars in this graph:

1. (11): (1, 0, 13)
2. (16): (0, 14, 5)
3. (14): (16, 17, 17)
4. (17): (14, 15, 3)
5. (6): (9, 7, 15)
6. (9): (6, 2, 13)
7. (7): (6, 18, 13)
8. (12): (13, 15, 19)
9. (5): (16, 19, 2)
10. (19): (12, 5, 8)
11. (8): (5, 19, 0)
12. (0): (11, 16, 8)
13. (18): (7, 6, 15)
14. (15): (17, 6, 12)
15. (3): (17, 4, 17)
16. (1): (11, 4, 1)
17. (2): (9, 5, 10)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [
17 ]
