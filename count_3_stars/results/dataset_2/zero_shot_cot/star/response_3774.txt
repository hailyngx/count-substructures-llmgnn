Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 3) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 5) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 17) (7, 25) (7, 29) (7, 23) (10, 13) (10, 25) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 29) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 16) (20, 15) (20, 23) (24, 4) (24, 5) (24, 19) (26, 21) (26, 0) (27, 21) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 2) (25, 7) (25, 10) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 14) (16, 15) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 18) (28, 27) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 5) (3, 22) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 8) (9, 12) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 14) (18, 29) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (14, 25) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 2) (0, 26) (0, 8) (2, 27) (2, 14) (6, 25) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 20) (19, 1) (19, 24) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 9) (17, 4) (5, 21) (5, 24) (5, 28) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Central Node: 1
   Leaves: 22, 21, 19
   <1, (22, 21, 19)>

2. Central Node: 22
   Leaves: 13, 3, 1
   <22, (13, 3, 1)>

3. Central Node: 21
   Leaves: 1, 27, 26
   <21, (1, 27, 26)>

4. Central Node: 4
   Leaves: 27, 24, 17
   <4, (27, 24, 17)>

5. Central Node: 7
   Leaves: 25, 29, 23
   <7, (25, 29, 23)>

6. Central Node: 10
   Leaves: 13, 25, 25
   <10, (13, 25, 25)>

7. Central Node: 15
   Leaves: 20, 23, 12
   <15, (20, 23, 12)>

8. Central Node: 20
   Leaves: 15, 23, 15
   <20, (15, 23, 15)>

9. Central Node: 24
   Leaves: 4, 5, 19
   <24, (4, 5, 19)>

10. Central Node: 26
    Leaves: 21, 0, 27
    <26, (21, 0, 27)>

11. Central Node: 27
    Leaves: 21, 4, 28
    <27, (21, 4, 28)>

12. Central Node: 25
    Leaves: 7, 10, 6
    <25, (7, 10, 6)>

13. Central Node: 16
    Leaves: 15, 28, 3
    <16, (15, 28, 3)>

14. Central Node: 28
    Leaves: 27, 25, 16
    <28, (27, 25, 16)>

15. Central Node: 3
    Leaves: 22, 16, 14
    <3, (22, 16, 14)>

16. Central Node: 8
    Leaves: 11, 3, 0
    <8, (11, 3, 0)>

17. Central Node: 18
    Leaves: 11, 16, 14
    <18, (11, 16, 14)>

18. Central Node: 29
    Leaves: 7, 11, 18
    <29, (7, 11, 18)>

19. Central Node: 14
    Leaves: 25, 3, 18
    <14, (25, 3, 18)>

20. Central Node: 0
    Leaves: 26, 8, -
    <0, (26, 8)>
