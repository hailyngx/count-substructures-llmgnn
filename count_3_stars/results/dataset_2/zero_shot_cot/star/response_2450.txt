Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 19) (27, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 10) (22, 20) (23, 22) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 20) (18, 1) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 25) (6, 27) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 19) (9, 0) (9, 11) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 25) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 29) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (29, 4) (29, 26) (29, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 15) (21, 2) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 13) (11, 9) (11, 24) (11, 13) (11, 20) (7, 0) (7, 23) (7, 5) (15, 6) (15, 14) (16, 28) (16, 25) (16, 5) (13, 28) (13, 11) (13, 25) (26, 2) (26, 29) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 16) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 29) (24, 11) (19, 27) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 20) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 11) (20, 19) (10, 3) (10, 22) (25, 18) (25, 2) (25, 16) (25, 13)
