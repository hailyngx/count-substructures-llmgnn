Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 6) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 25) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 9) (27, 13) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 22) (6, 16) (24, 22) (24, 2) (26, 7) (26, 8) (26, 4) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 25) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 10) (10, 20) (10, 9) (15, 9) (2, 16) (2, 24) (2, 22) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 24) (22, 2) (22, 0) (25, 21) (25, 17) (25, 29) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 23) (3, 0) (3, 23) (3, 29) (3, 18) (1, 28) (1, 4) (14, 27) (14, 19) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 23) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 28) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (4, 26) (4, 20) (4, 1) (4, 13) (13, 27) (13, 4) (13, 29) (29, 25) (29, 3) (29, 8) (29, 13) (28, 1) (28, 18) (23, 0) (23, 3) (23, 9) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph. Let's find them step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3:
- Node 4 has degree 4 (connects with nodes 1, 13, 20, 26).
- Node 5 has degree 3 (connects with nodes 7, 18, 22).
- Node 9 has degree 5 (connects with nodes 11, 15, 23, 27, 10).
- Node 13 has degree 3 (connects with nodes 4, 27, 29).
- Node 16 has degree 4 (connects with nodes 2, 6, 11, 19).
- Node 17 has degree 4 (connects with nodes 7, 11, 20, 25).
- Node 22 has degree 5 (connects with nodes 0, 2, 5, 24, 16).
- Node 26 has degree 4 (connects with nodes 4, 7, 8, 21).
- Node 29 has degree 4 (connects with nodes 3, 8, 13, 25).

2. Identify 3-stars:
- Node 5: <5, (7, 18, 22)>
- Node 13: <13, (4, 27, 29)>
- Node 22: <22, (0, 5, 24)>

3. Count the number of 3-stars:
