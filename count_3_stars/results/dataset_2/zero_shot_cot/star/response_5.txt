Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

First, let's list the nodes along with their degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 5
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 4

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 9, 2)>
<1, (7, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 1, 2)>
<0, (4, 6, 2)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
