Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 5: (5, 2, 7), (5, 4, 8), (5, 7, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 1, 4), (9, 3, 8), (9, 5, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 9), (4, 5, 8), (4, 0, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 2, 5), (8, 4, 5), (8, 6, 2), (8, 8, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 5, 8), (2, 6, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 9), (1, 7, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 2, 8), (6, 7, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 9), (3, 7, 8)

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we find there are [17] 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (2, 7, 5)>, <5, (4, 8, 5)>, <5, (7, 9, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 4)>, <4, (1, 9, 4)>, <4, (5, 8, 4)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (6, 2, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 2)>, <2, (6, 7, 2)>, <1, (4, 9, 1)>, <1, (7, 9, 1)>, <6, (2, 8, 6)>, <6, (7, 4, 6)>.
