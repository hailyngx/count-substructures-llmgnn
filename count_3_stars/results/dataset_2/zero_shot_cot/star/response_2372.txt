Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
We can identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking at nodes that have exactly 3 connections. 

Let's list the nodes along with their degrees:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 5
- Node 2: Degree 5
- Node 3: Degree 4
- Node 4: Degree 5
- Node 5: Degree 4
- Node 6: Degree 5
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 5
- Node 9: Degree 4

Next, we can identify the 3-stars:
<1, (6, 4, 9)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (8, 6, 0)>
<6, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 4, 0)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
