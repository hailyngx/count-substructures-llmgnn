Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, which can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

The possible centers and their respective neighbors with 3 connections are:
- Node 2: (6, 7, 3, 1)
- Node 4: (6, 10, 12, 5)
- Node 5: (7, 12, 13, 8)
- Node 7: (10, 12, 5, 1)
- Node 8: (9, 11, 0, 5)
- Node 9: (6, 8, 12, 0)
- Node 10: (6, 7, 4, 4)
- Node 12: (9, 11, 7, 13)
- Node 13: (11, 12, 14, 5)
- Node 14: (1, 2, 13)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Total 3-stars: [7]
Unique 3-stars: 
<2, (6, 7, 3, 1)>
<4, (6, 10, 12, 5)>
<5, (7, 12, 13, 8)>
<7, (10, 12, 5, 1)>
<12, (9, 11, 7, 13)>
<13, (11, 12, 14, 5)>
<14, (1, 2, 13)>
