Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 10) (14, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3.

Nodes with degree 3: 4, 13, 2, 14

Next, let's find the edges within these potential 3-stars. For each node with degree 3, we need to determine if the connected nodes form a 3-star configuration.

Starting with node 4:
Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 10. This forms a 3-star <4, (7, 8, 10)>.

Moving on to node 13:
Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 9, and 0. This forms a 3-star <13, (10, 9, 0)>.

Next, node 2:
Node 2 is connected to nodes 11 and 0, but does not form a 3-star since it only has degree 2.

Lastly, node 14:
Node 14 is connected to node 9, but does not form a 3-star since it only has degree 1.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<4, (7, 8, 10)>, <13, (10, 9, 0)>].
