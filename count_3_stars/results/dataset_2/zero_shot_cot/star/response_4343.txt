Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) 

Response:
First, find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 3.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 2.

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
