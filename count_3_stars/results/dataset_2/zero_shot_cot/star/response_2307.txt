Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (21, 3) (21, 22) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 13) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 25) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 10) (17, 6) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 27) (17, 15) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 23) (7, 25) (7, 3) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 0) (25, 18) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (27, 17) (27, 20) (27, 19) (3, 26) (3, 21) (3, 7) (3, 4) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 10) (19, 27) (19, 15) (0, 25) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 22) (11, 13) (14, 1) (14, 20) (14, 23) (14, 16) (28, 8) (28, 17) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 29) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 20) (22, 11) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 15) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 29) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 29) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 18) (23, 20) (23, 14) 

Response:
Let's first find the 3-stars in the graph:

- From the given edges, we can see that the 3-stars are formed by the central node and three leaf nodes connected to it.
- To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify unique sets of nodes where one node is the center and the other three are leaves connected to it.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (2, 8, 14)>
<2, (1, 8, 25)>
<3, (4, 7, 21)>
<4, (3, 10, 15)>
<5, (6, 12, 17)>
<6, (5, 13, 22)>
<7, (3, 25, 29)>
<8, (1, 2, 28)>
<9, (12, 16, 26)>
<10, (4, 12, 18)>
<11, (13, 15, 22)>
<13, (6, 11, 15)>
<14, (1, 16, 20)>
<15, (4, 13, 17)>
<16, (9, 14, 29)>
<17, (5, 17, 28)>
<18, (10, 18, 25)>
<19, (15, 19, 27)>
<20, (14, 20, 23)>
<21, (3, 21, 22)>
<22, (6, 11, 20)>
<23, (20, 23, 14)>
<25, (2, 7, 25)>
<26, (9, 16, 26)>
<27, (17, 19, 20)>
<28, (8, 17, 28)>
<29, (15, 16, 18)>

So, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
