Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 19) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 18) (18, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (10, 3) (10, 8) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 15) (9, 8) (12, 8) (12, 17) (6, 11) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 19) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars, which consist of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here's the step-by-step process to identify the 3-stars:
1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges (leaves).
2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their neighbors.

Let's start by identifying nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 11 has 4 edges
- Node 16 has 5 edges
- Node 3 has 5 edges
- Node 15 has 4 edges
- Node 1 has 4 edges
- Node 5 has 5 edges
- Node 13 has 3 edges
- Node 7 has 2 edges
- Node 10 has 2 edges
- Node 8 has 4 edges
- Node 9 has 2 edges
- Node 12 has 2 edges
- Node 6 has 1 edge
- Node 4 has 4 edges
- Node 19 has 4 edges
- Node 17 has 3 edges
- Node 2 has 2 edges
- Node 18 has 3 edges
- Node 0 has 2 edges

Nodes 13, 7, 10, 9, 12, 6, 2, 18, and 0 do not have exactly three edges and thus cannot be part of any 3-stars.

Now, let's check the nodes with exactly three edges to see if they form 3-stars:
1. Node 11 <11, (16, 6, 4)> [1]
2. Node 3 <3, (16, 15, 1)> [2]
3. Node 15 <15, (3, 9, 14)> [3]
4. Node 1 <1, (16, 3, 13)> [4]
5. Node 5 <5, (18, 0, 13)> [5]
6. Node 17 <17, (15, 12, 19)> [6]
7. Node 4 <4, (11, 5, 19)> [7]
8. Node 19 <19, (16, 4, 17)> [8]
9. Node 16 <16, (11, 1, 3)> [9]
10. Node 18 <18, (16, 2, 5)> [10]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
