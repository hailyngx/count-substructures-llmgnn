Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 20) (16, 22) (16, 2) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 23) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 13) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 5) (25, 22) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 21) (0, 14) (0, 19) (20, 11) (20, 23) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 6) (6, 16) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 29) (17, 25) (17, 22) (29, 6) (29, 13) (29, 18) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 24) (8, 11) (8, 14) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 26) (2, 16) (2, 12) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 23) (26, 21) (26, 4) (26, 10) (18, 29) (18, 23) (19, 15) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 10) (24, 3) (24, 14) (23, 21) (23, 3) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 18) (22, 16) (22, 25) (22, 17) (22, 28) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 28) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 13) 

Response:
There are three steps to follow in order to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify nodes that are directly connected to three other nodes.

From the given edges:
- Node 3 is directly connected to nodes 25, 24, and 23.
- Node 21 is directly connected to nodes 1, 6, and 0.

Step 2: For each set of three connected nodes, check if there is a central node connected to them.

Based on the identified nodes:
- Node 3 is the central node of a 3-star with leaves 25, 24, and 23.
- Node 21 is the central node of a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, and 0.

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found.

<3, (25, 24, 23)>
<21, (1, 6, 0)>

Now, calculate the total number of 3-stars in the given graph inside brackets: [2].
