Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<2, (9, 1, 4)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (9, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 6)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>

Count the number of 3-stars: [7]
