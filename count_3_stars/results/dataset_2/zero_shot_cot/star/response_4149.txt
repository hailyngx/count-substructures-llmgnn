Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 7) (21, 10) (21, 17) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 3) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 20) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 16) (2, 1) (2, 12) (6, 28) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 20) (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 11) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 5) (11, 28) (11, 17) (11, 24) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 26) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 13) (16, 26) (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (22, 4) (22, 9) (22, 10) (13, 16) (13, 25) (13, 24) (26, 3) (26, 16) (10, 21) (10, 22) (10, 19) (10, 23) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 5) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 19) (19, 10) (19, 15) (25, 13) (20, 1) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 9) (20, 23) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 24) (5, 7) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (2, 7, 20)>
<4, (8, 22, 27)>
<8, (4, 16, 5)>
<10, (21, 19, 22)>
<11, (17, 24, 28)>
<13, (16, 24, 25)>
<15, (14, 19, 9)>
<16, (8, 13, 26)>
<17, (21, 23, 29)>
<20, (1, 27, 28)>
<22, (9, 10, 4)>
<24, (11, 13, 7)>
<26, (3, 16, 26)>
<28, (11, 16, 20)>
<29, (5, 7, 17)>

Counting the unique 3-stars we found, we have a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
