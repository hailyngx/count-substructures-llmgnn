Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 23) (0, 6) (27, 22) (27, 10) (27, 16) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 20) (8, 21) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 9) (29, 19) (2, 8) (2, 10) (11, 28) (11, 17) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 1) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 3) (9, 7) (17, 11) (17, 6) (7, 9) (7, 24) (16, 27) (16, 24) (16, 18) (19, 29) (22, 27) (22, 25) (22, 1) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 18) (26, 10) (26, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 23) (24, 4) (24, 7) (24, 16) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 18) (25, 28) (25, 9) (25, 22) (25, 1) (25, 15) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 14) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 15) (1, 13) (1, 22) (1, 25) (20, 8) (20, 28) (23, 0) (23, 3) (23, 21) (12, 5) (12, 26) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 6) (21, 4) (21, 8) (21, 9) (21, 23) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

First, let's identify all nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 23
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 24, and 14
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 10
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 15
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 27, 24, and 18
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 23
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 28, 9, and 22

Now, we have found 7 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 15, 23)>
<4, (8, 24, 14)>
<8, (4, 2, 10)>
<14, (4, 6, 15)>
<16, (27, 24, 18)>
<21, (4, 8, 23)>
<25, (28, 9, 22)>
