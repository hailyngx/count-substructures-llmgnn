Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 17) (1, 9) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (7, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (9, 1) (9, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (11, 15) (11, 12) (11, 9) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (16, 13) (16, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 3, 15, 8, 13, 2, 18, 0, 1, 7, 19, 12, 9, 6, and 16.

Next, we will list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (0, 10, 15)>
<15, (2, 11, 3)>
<8, (5, 17, 19)>
<13, (4, 6, 16)>
<2, (5, 12, 18)>
<18, (2, 5, 12)>
<0, (3, 7, 15)>
<1, (9, 17, 19)>
<7, (0, 6, 17)>
<19, (4, 8, 17)>
<12, (2, 6, 10)>
<9, (1, 11, 15)>
<6, (7, 12, 13)>
<16, (4, 13, 8)>

There are a total of 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
