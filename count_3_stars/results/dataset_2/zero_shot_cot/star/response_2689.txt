Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 12) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 1) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 17) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 19) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 18) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 3) (0, 1) (0, 5) (3, 14) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with 3 connections:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 2, and 14.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 18, and 2.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 18.
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 13, and 15.
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 2, and 10.
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 14, 12, and 17.
   
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - <4, (7, 2, 14)>
   - <7, (4, 18, 2)>
   - <2, (4, 7, 18)>
   - <14, (4, 13, 15)>
   - <18, (7, 2, 10)>
   - <15, (14, 12, 17)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
