Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
Given graph:
Node 0 => {4, 13, 5, 14}
Node 1 => {5, 7, 6, 10}
Node 2 => {9, 4, 14, 12, 10}
Node 3 => {5, 10, 13, 12}
Node 4 => {0, 11, 6, 2}
Node 5 => {1, 7, 0, 3}
Node 6 => {4, 7, 1}
Node 7 => {5, 11, 6, 14, 1}
Node 8 => {13, 10, 11, 12}
Node 9 => {2, 14}
Node 10 => {1, 3, 8, 2}
Node 11 => {4, 7, 8, 0, 14}
Node 12 => {3, 8, 2}
Node 13 => {3, 8, 0}
Node 14 => {9, 7, 0, 11, 2}

[<0, (4, 13, 5)>, <1, (5, 7, 6)>, <2, (9, 4, 14)>, <3, (5, 10, 13)>] (<4, 0, 14>, <7, 5, 1>, <10, 3, 8>)
