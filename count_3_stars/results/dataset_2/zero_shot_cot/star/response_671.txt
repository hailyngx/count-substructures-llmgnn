Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 2, and 8.
   <6, (9, 5, 2)>
   <6, (9, 2, 8)>
   <6, (5, 2, 0)>
   <6, (2, 8, 0)>
   
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 2, and 1.
   <9, (6, 4, 2)>
   <9, (6, 2, 0)>
   <9, (4, 1, 0)>

3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 4, and 8.
   <1, (9, 3, 4)>
   <1, (9, 4, 0)>
   
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
   There are no 3-stars involving node 3. 

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 0, and 2.
   <4, (9, 1, 0)>
   
6. Node 7 is connected to node 1.
   There are no 3-stars involving node 7.

7. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 8, and 0.
   <5, (6, 3, 8)>
   <5, (6, 8, 0)>
   <5, (3, 1, 0)>
   <5, (8, 2, 0)>

8. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 4, and 8.
   <2, (6, 9, 8)>
   <2, (6, 4, 0)>
   <2, (9, 1, 0)>
   <2, (4, 8, 0)>

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 5, 2, and 0.
   <8, (6, 1, 5)>
   <8, (6, 2, 0)>
   <8, (1, 4, 0)>
   <8, (5, 3, 0)>
   <8, (2, 4, 0)>

10. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 4, 5, and 8.
   <0, (6, 9, 4)>
   <0, (6, 5, 8)>
   <0, (9, 1, 4)>
   <0, (4, 2, 8)>
   <0, (5, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of 18 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
So, the final answer is: [18]
