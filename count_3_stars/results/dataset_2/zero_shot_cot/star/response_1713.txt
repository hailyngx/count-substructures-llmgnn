Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
