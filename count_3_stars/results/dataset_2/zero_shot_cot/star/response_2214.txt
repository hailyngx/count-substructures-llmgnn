Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star. Since each 3-star contains one central node and three leaf nodes, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 
- Node 6 (neighbors: 9, 5, 1)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 6, 3, 7)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 6, 3, 2)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 9, 1, 5)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 6, 3, 8)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 4, 7)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 6, 3, 2)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 9, 1, 0)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 1, 4, 5)
- Node 0 (neighbors: 6, 9, 1)

Next, let's construct the 3-stars using the identified central nodes and their corresponding leaf nodes:
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<3, (9, 1, 5)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 3, 2)>
<7, (9, 1, 0)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (6, 9, 1)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: 10

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
