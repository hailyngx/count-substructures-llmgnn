Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all the unique 3-stars. 

1. <5, (9, 8, 4)>
2. <9, (5, 8, 7)>
3. <4, (5, 7, 2)>
4. <7, (9, 4, 1)>
5. <6, (5, 4, 1)>
6. <2, (4, 8, 0)>
7. <8, (5, 9, 2)>
8. <1, (7, 6, 0)>
9. <3, (9, 4, 7)>
10. <0, (6, 8, 1)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
