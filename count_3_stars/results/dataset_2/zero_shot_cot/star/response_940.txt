Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (6, 2) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 13) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 0) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 19) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 10) (2, 6) (2, 17) (10, 0) (10, 16) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 1) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 19) (4, 11) (4, 19) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 4) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 1) (5, 3) (5, 18) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
- (3, 15, 8) is a 3-star centered at node 3. 
- (13, 15, 8) is a 3-star centered at node 13.
- (0, 14, 18) is a 3-star centered at node 0.
- (2, 17, 12) is a 3-star centered at node 2.
- (0, 13, 10) is a 3-star centered at node 0.
- (1, 18, 11) is a 3-star centered at node 1.
- (4, 19, 11) is a 3-star centered at node 4.
- (16, 14, 10) is a 3-star centered at node 16.
- (5, 18, 3) is a 3-star centered at node 5.

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph. 

<3, (15, 8, 5)>, <13, (15, 8, 0)>, <0, (14, 18, 10)>, <2, (17, 12, 7)>, <1, (18, 11, 4)>, <4, (19, 11, 1)>, <16, (14, 10, 18)>, <5, (18, 3, 5)>
