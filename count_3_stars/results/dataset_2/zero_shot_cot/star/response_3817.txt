Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 15) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 6) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 4) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 15) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 7) (16, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 11) (19, 17) (8, 14) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (0, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 10, 15. (Degree: 4)
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 13. (Degree: 3)
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 16. (Degree: 3)
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 12, 14. (Degree: 3)
   - Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 14, 19. (Degree: 3)
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 13, 17. (Degree: 4)
   - Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 10, 12, 15. (Degree: 5)
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9, 11. (Degree: 4)
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 4, 13, 17, 18. (Degree: 4)
   - Node 17 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 12, 15, 19. (Degree: 5)
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 15. (Degree: 3)

2. For each node with exactly 3 neighbors, check if it forms a 3-star.
   - Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and 13: <5, (9, 11, 13)>
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 16: <6, (1, 7, 16)>
   - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 12, and 14: <9, (5, 12, 14)>
   - Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 14: <11, (5, 9, 14)>
   - Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 15: <18, (1, 2, 15)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <5, (9, 11, 13)>, <6, (1, 7, 16)>, <9, (5, 12, 14)>, and <11, (5, 9, 14)>.
