Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 9) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 5) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (19, 18) (19, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 2) (17, 12) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 15) (2, 3) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) 

Response:
We will count the number of 3-stars in this graph by examining each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star structure.

Starting with node 0:
- <0, (7, 8, 10)> (1 star)

Node 1:
- No 3-star as it only has one neighbor.

Node 2:
- <2, (1, 6, 15)> (1 star)
- <2, (3, 15, 6)> (2 stars)

Node 3:
- <3, (2, 7, 19)> (1 star)

Node 4:
- <4, (8, 10, 12)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 4 as the central node.

Node 5:
- <5, (6, 14, 18)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 5 as the central node.

Node 6:
- <6, (2, 5, 9)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 6 as the central node.

Node 7:
- <7, (0, 13, 3)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 7 as the central node.

Node 8:
- <8, (0, 4, 10)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 8 as the central node.

Node 9:
- <9, (6, 10, 14)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 9 as the central node.

Node 10:
- <10, (8, 4, 9)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 10 as the central node.

Node 11:
- <11, (14, 15, 16)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 11 as the central node.

Node 12:
- <12, (4, 18, 17)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 12 as the central node.

Node 13:
- <13, (7, 8, 15)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 13 as the central node.

Node 14:
- <14, (5, 9, 11)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 14 as the central node.

Node 15:
- <15, (1, 2, 13)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 15 as the central node.

Node 16:
- <16, (11, 9, 15)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 16 as the central node.

Node 17:
- No 3-star as it only has one neighbor.

Node 18:
- <18, (4, 5, 19)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 18 as the central node.

Node 19:
- <19, (3, 18, 8)> (1 star)
- No 3-star with node 19 as the central node.

Total unique 3-stars: 13
[13]
