Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 18) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 8) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (0, 18) (0, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 10) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 15) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 
- The center node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a 3-star.
- We will check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star.

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (1, 12, 2)>
<3, (1, 8, 14)>
<4, (9, 14, 16)>
<5, (1, 11, 17)>
<6, (9, 10, 6)>
<7, (1, 17, 7)>
<8, (3, 11, 15)>
<9, (6, 8, 16)>
<10, (6, 13, 19)>
<11, (5, 8, 17)>
<12, (2, 14, 15)>
<13, (10, 15, 17)>
<14, (3, 4, 15)>
<15, (8, 13, 14)>
<16, (4, 10, 16)>
<17, (5, 7, 11)>
<18, (0, 3, 8)>
<19, (10, 17, 19)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
