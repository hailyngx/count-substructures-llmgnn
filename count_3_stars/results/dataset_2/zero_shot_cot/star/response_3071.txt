Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (3, 4) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 19) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 2) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 17) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 17) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 9) (17, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 4, 13)>
2. Node 2 forms two 3-stars: <2, (10, 18, 14)> and <2, (8, 18, 2)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 12, 19)>
4. Node 7 forms two 3-stars: <7, (11, 18, 5)> and <7, (17, 9, 7)>
5. Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (11, 2, 0)>
6. Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (10, 7, 9)>
7. Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (5, 18, 19)>
8. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (1, 4, 16)>
9. Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (0, 7, 19)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
