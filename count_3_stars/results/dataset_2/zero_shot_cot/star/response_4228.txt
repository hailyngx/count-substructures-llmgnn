Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) form a 3-star. <0, (1, 4, 5)>
2. Node 1: (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) form a 3-star. <1, (9, 3, 0)>
3. Node 2: (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) form a 3-star. <2, (9, 4, 7)>
4. Node 3: (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) form a 3-star. <3, (9, 1, 8)>
5. Node 4: (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) form a 3-star. <4, (9, 3, 2)>
6. Node 5: (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) form a 3-star. <5, (6, 7, 0)>
7. Node 6: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) form a 3-star. <6, (9, 5, 8)>
8. Node 7: (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) form a 3-star. <7, (1, 2, 5)>
9. Node 8: (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) form a 3-star. <8, (6, 3, 2)>
10. Node 9: (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) form a 3-star. <9, (6, 4, 2)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the answer is [10].
