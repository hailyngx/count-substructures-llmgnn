Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 26) (11, 25) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 23) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 17) (29, 1) (1, 2) (1, 29) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 24) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 23) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 9) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 24) (17, 16) (17, 29) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 21) (26, 11) (26, 13) (26, 19) (21, 19) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 28) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 27) (14, 4) (25, 11) (25, 22) (25, 18) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 10) (6, 15) (6, 14) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (18, 19) (18, 25) (18, 23) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 0) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 27) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 23) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 24) (23, 16) (23, 13) (23, 18) (23, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each node that has exactly three neighbors.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<1, (2, 29, 5)>
<3, (5, 12, 15)>
<4, (0, 12, 14)>
<7, (9, 12, 24)>
<9, (2, 8, 28)>
<11, (5, 25, 26)>
<12, (3, 4, 7)>
<14, (4, 6, 22)>
<15, (0, 3, 6)>
<16, (17, 23, 29)>
<18, (19, 23, 25)>
<19, (18, 21, 26)>
<22, (14, 22, 27)>
<23, (0, 16, 18)>
<24, (7, 10, 12)>
<25, (11, 18, 22)>
<26, (11, 13, 19)>
<27, (10, 14, 22)>
<28, (9, 21, 27)>
<29, (1, 16, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
