Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 11) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 14) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 19) (5, 17) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 15) (6, 16) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 2) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 16) (16, 6) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 9) 

Response:
We need to find all the 3-stars in the given graph. Let's analyze the nodes and their connections:

- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 14), (0, 18)
- Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 10), (1, 12)
- Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 19)
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 14), (3, 2)
- Node 4: (4, 19), (4, 10), (4, 3)
- Node 5: (5, 17), (5, 8), (5, 11)
- Node 6: (6, 15), (6, 16)
- Node 7: (7, 11), (7, 18)
- Node 8: (8, 17), (8, 19), (8, 5), (8, 14)
- Node 9: (9, 12), (9, 15), (9, 16)
- Node 10: (10, 4), (10, 1), (10, 17)
- Node 11: (11, 7), (11, 17), (11, 5), (11, 13)
- Node 12: (12, 1), (12, 9)
- Node 13: (13, 16), (13, 11)
- Node 14: (14, 3), (14, 8), (14, 0)
- Node 15: (15, 6), (15, 9)
- Node 16: (16, 6), (16, 18), (16, 13), (16, 9)
- Node 17: (17, 10), (17, 5), (17, 8), (17, 11)
- Node 18: (18, 7), (18, 0), (18, 16)
- Node 19: (19, 4), (19, 8), (19, 2)

Identifying the 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 14, 18)>
- <1, (2, 10, 12)>
- <2, (1, 3, 19)>
- <3, (0, 4, 14)>
- <4, (19, 10, 3)>
- <5, (17, 8, 11)>
- <6, (15, 16, 9)>
- <7, (11, 17, 18)>
- <8, (17, 19, 5)>
- <9, (12, 15, 16)>
- <10, (4, 1, 17)>
- <11, (7, 17, 13)>
- <12, (1, 9, 15)>
- <13, (16, 11, 13)>
- <14, (3, 8, 0)>
- <15, (6, 9, 12)>
- <16, (6, 18, 13)>
- <17, (5, 8, 11)>
- <18, (7, 0, 16)>
- <19, (4, 8, 2)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars: 
[20]
