Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 7) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (17, 18) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (18, 17) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 11) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of nodes that can be central nodes in a 3-star. For each center node, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 nodes from the remaining nodes to form a star.

In this graph, the possible central nodes are 0, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, and 19.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- For node 0: There are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 2: There are 1 possible 3-star.
- For node 3: There are 2 possible 3-stars.
- For node 6: There are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 8: There are 2 possible 3-stars.
- For node 9: There are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 11: There are 2 possible 3-stars.
- For node 12: There are 2 possible 3-stars.
- For node 14: There are 1 possible 3-star.
- For node 15: There are 4 possible 3-stars.
- For node 16: There are 1 possible 3-star.
- For node 18: There are 1 possible 3-star.
- For node 19: There are 2 possible 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
4 (node 0) + 1 (node 2) + 2 (node 3) + 4 (node 6) + 2 (node 8) + 4 (node 9) + 2 (node 11) + 2 (node 12) + 1 (node 14) + 4 (node 15) + 1 (node 16) + 1 (node 18) + 2 (node 19) = 29

Therefore, the final answer is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 8, 16)>, <2, (0, 8, 5)>, <3, (13, 12, 19)>, <6, (9, 15, 16)>, <8, (2, 0, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 10)>, <11, (8, 5, 15)>, <12, (8, 13, 10)>, <14, (18, 12, 13)>, <15, (6, 0, 7)>, <16, (0, 6, 15)>, <18, (17, 14, 19)>, <19, (6, 1, 3)>
