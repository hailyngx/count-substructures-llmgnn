Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (22, 2) (22, 11) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 21) (1, 14) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 14) (26, 5) (26, 28) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 27) (28, 23) (6, 21) (6, 3) (6, 18) (7, 13) (7, 25) (7, 0) (25, 7) (25, 10) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 11) (24, 23) (24, 29) (24, 20) (10, 13) (10, 25) (10, 29) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 20) (29, 24) (29, 10) (29, 11) (27, 28) (27, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 15) (17, 27) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 1) (14, 21) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 20) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 23) (23, 28) (23, 24) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 12) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (19, 14) (19, 20) (15, 0) (15, 16) (20, 24) (20, 3) (20, 14) (20, 19) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 29) (11, 4) (12, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 0: 7, 15, 11
Node 1: 21, 14
Node 2: 22, 5, 9
Node 3: 9, 28, 6, 20
Node 4: 13, 16, 23, 11
Node 5: 9, 26, 2, 11
Node 6: 21, 3, 18
Node 7: 13, 25, 0
Node 8: 17, 14
Node 9: 5, 2, 3
Node 10: 13, 25, 29
Node 11: 22, 5, 0, 29, 4
Node 12: 23
Node 13: 4, 10, 7
Node 14: 1, 21, 8, 19, 20
Node 15: 0, 16
Node 16: 18, 4, 15
Node 17: 27, 8
Node 18: 6, 16, 23
Node 19: 14, 20
Node 20: 24, 3, 14, 19
Node 21: 1, 6, 14
Node 22: 2, 11
Node 23: 28, 24, 18, 4, 12
Node 24: 23, 29, 20
Node 25: 7, 10
Node 26: 5, 28
Node 27: 28, 17
Node 28: 26, 3, 27, 23
Node 29: 24, 10, 11

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by identifying the central node and its three connected nodes:

1. <3, (9, 28, 6)>
2. <4, (13, 16, 23)>
3. <5, (9, 2, 26)>
4. <6, (21, 3, 18)>
5. <9, (5, 2, 3)>
6. <11, (22, 5, 4)>
7. <14, (1, 21, 8)>
8. <16, (18, 4, 15)>
9. <20, (24, 3, 14)>
10. <23, (28, 24, 18)>
11. <28, (26, 3, 27)>
12. <29, (24, 10, 11)>

So, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
