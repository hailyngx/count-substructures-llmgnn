Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

There are 4 nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes: nodes 0, 5, 8, and 10. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (9, 8, 14)>
<5, (11, 4, 2)>
<8, (4, 2, 12)>
<10, (9, 11, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
