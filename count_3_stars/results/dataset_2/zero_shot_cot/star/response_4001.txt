Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 12) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 7, 4)>
<9, (6, 2, 10)>
<4, (6, 7, 14)>
<7, (6, 4, 3)>
<10, (9, 11, 8)>
<11, (10, 1, 14)>
<2, (9, 8, 13)>
<8, (10, 2, 1)>
<0, (6, 9, 3)>
<12, (2, 5, 1)>
<14, (6, 11, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 10)>
<1, (11, 8, 12)>
<5, (0, 12, 14)>
<13, (9, 11, 2)>

Since we have identified 15 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
