Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the potential 3-stars. Central nodes have degree 3 in a 3-star graph. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 8, and 9 each have a degree of 3, making them potential central nodes.

Second, for each potential central node, let's find the adjacent nodes connected to it. Then, we will determine if there are exactly three adjacent nodes for each central node. 

For central node 1:
Adjacent nodes: 2, 4, 5, 7, 3, 8
There are three edges connected to node 1: (1, 2), (1, 4), and (1, 5).
Therefore, the 3-star for central node 1 is <1, (2, 4, 5)>.

For central node 8:
Adjacent nodes: 9, 7, 1, 6, 0
There are three edges connected to node 8: (8, 9), (8, 7), and (8, 1).
Therefore, the 3-star for central node 8 is <8, (9, 7, 1)>.

For central node 9:
Adjacent nodes: 8, 2, 3, 0
There are three edges connected to node 9: (9, 8), (9, 3), and (9, 2).
Therefore, the 3-star for central node 9 is <9, (8, 3, 2)>.

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [3].
List of unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (9, 7, 1)>, <9, (8, 3, 2)>.
