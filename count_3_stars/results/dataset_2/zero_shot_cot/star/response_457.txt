Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 7) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 19) (21, 15) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (19, 2) (19, 28) (26, 5) (17, 29) (17, 23) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 23) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 20) (20, 5) (20, 9) (4, 13) (4, 27) (4, 0) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 7) (11, 9) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 2) (7, 22) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 27) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 9) (25, 5) (25, 16) (1, 28) (14, 27) (14, 16) (9, 20) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 23) (23, 17) (23, 29) (23, 16) (23, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 3 is the center of the 3-star: (3, 12, 15), (3, 15, 29)

2. Node 12 is the center of the 3-star: (12, 2, 8)

3. Node 22 is the center of the 3-star: (22, 7, 18)

4. Node 28 is the center of the 3-star: (28, 6, 21)

5. Node 2 is the center of the 3-star: (2, 18, 19)

6. Node 13 is the center of the 3-star: (13, 4, 7), (13, 5, 8)

7. Node 21 is the center of the 3-star: (21, 15, 6), (21, 18, 28)

8. Node 5 is the center of the 3-star: (5, 2, 26), (5, 13, 20)

9. Node 4 is the center of the 3-star: (4, 0, 27)

10. Node 22 is the center of the 3-star: (22, 7, 12)

11. Node 7 is the center of the 3-star: (7, 8, 13), (7, 16, 27)

12. Node 28 is the center of the 3-star: (28, 0, 1), (28, 19, 6)

So, there are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
