Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 17) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (18, 16) (18, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 1) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (14, 11) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 5) (17, 9) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 16) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 10) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify them based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the edges given, we can identify the 3-stars. Let's list them out:

<9, (6, 8, 17)>
<4, (7, 0, 16)>
<7, (9, 4, 11)>
<11, (7, 8, 14)>
<8, (9, 11, 15)>
<10, (11, 13, 19)>
<1, (6, 19, 12)>
<12, (1, 13, 5)>
<13, (10, 12, 5)>
<15, (8, 19, 5)>
<16, (9, 4, 18)>

There are a total of [11] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
