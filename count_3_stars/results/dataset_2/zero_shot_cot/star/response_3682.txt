Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 15) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 19) (10, 12) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node. 

Let's calculate the 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: (0, 9, 17), total 1
- Node 1: (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 11), (1, 7, 19), total 3
- Node 2: (2, 4, 8), (2, 8, 19), total 2
- Node 3: (3, 1, 5), total 1
- Node 4: (4, 2, 12), (4, 11, 5), total 2
- Node 5: (5, 1, 3), total 1
- Node 6: (6, 5, 7), total 1
- Node 7: (7, 1, 19), (7, 6, 11), total 2
- Node 8: (8, 2, 19), total 1
- Node 9: (9, 0, 17), total 1
- Node 10: (10, 1, 12), (10, 2, 19), total 2
- Node 11: (11, 4, 5), (11, 7, 14), total 2
- Node 12: (12, 2, 4), (12, 3, 10), total 2
- Node 13: (13, 14, 17), total 1
- Node 14: (14, 11, 13), (14, 17, 0), total 2
- Node 15: (15, 0, 12), (15, 8, 12), total 2
- Node 17: (17, 0, 14), (17, 9, 14), total 2
- Node 19: (19, 7, 8), (19, 9, 10), total 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19] when counting each unique 3-star only once. 
The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (9, 17)>, <1, (3, 5)>, <1, (5, 11)>, <1, (7, 19)>, <2, (4, 8)>, <2, (8, 19)>, <4, (2, 12)>, <4, (5, 11)>, <7, (6, 11)>, <7, (1, 19)>, <10, (1, 12)>, <10, (2, 19)>, <11, (4, 5)>, <11, (7, 14)>, <12, (2, 4)>, <12, (3, 10)>, <13, (14, 17)>, <14, (11, 13)>, <14, (17, 0)>.
