Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 21) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 0) (3, 25) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 13) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 2) (4, 24) (4, 26) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 1) (21, 5) (21, 11) (24, 4) (24, 19) (2, 17) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 28) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 22) (26, 4) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 14) (13, 5) (13, 25) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 7) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 20) (12, 1) (12, 23) (16, 20) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 27) (7, 18) (7, 15) (7, 27) (20, 5) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 16) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 29) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 12) (19, 24) (19, 29) (29, 26) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 22) (1, 18) (1, 12) (11, 21) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 22) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 29) (22, 11) (27, 2) (27, 6) (27, 7)

2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 0, and 13.  
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 6, and 17.  
4. Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 13, and 6.  
5. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 15, and 23.  
6. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 6, and 2.  
7. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 24, 26, and 18.  
8. Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 11, and 20.  
9. Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 19, and 26.  
10. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 27, and 6.  
11. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 11, and 0.  
12. Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 18, and 28.  
13. Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 26, and 14.  
14. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 25, and 14.  
15. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 23, and 7.  
16. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 17, and 2.  
17. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 15, and 27.  
18. Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 14.  
19. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 11.  
20. Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 15, and 12.  
21. Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 24, 29, and 26.  
22. Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 0, and 19.  
23. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 12, and 7.  
24. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 8, and 0.  
25. Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 8, and 29.  
26. Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 6, and 7.

After listing all the unique 3-stars, we can count them to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
