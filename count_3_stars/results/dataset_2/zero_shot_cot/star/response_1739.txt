Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected in the form of a 3-star, where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 0: <5, (6, 4, 0)>
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 7: <9, (4, 1, 7)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 2: <6, (5, 1, 2)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7: <4, (5, 9, 7)>
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 1: <7, (9, 4, 1)>
6. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 7: <1, (9, 6, 7)>
7. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 1: <3, (5, 4, 1)>
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 1: <8, (6, 7, 1)>
9. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3: <0, (5, 9, 3)>
10. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 0: <2, (6, 1, 0)>

Finally, counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we have found 10 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
