Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Central node 5: Leaves 9, 2, 8
2. Central node 9: Leaves 5, 8, 3
3. Central node 4: Leaves 7, 8, 0
4. Central node 7: Leaves 9, 4, 2
5. Central node 1: Leaves 7, 3, 6
6. Central node 3: Leaves 9, 4, 1
7. Central node 6: Leaves 4, 1

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
Unique 3-stars found: <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (7, 3, 6)>, and <3, (9, 4, 1)>, <6, (4, 1)>
