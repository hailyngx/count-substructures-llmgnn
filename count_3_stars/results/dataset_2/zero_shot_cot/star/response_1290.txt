Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, 0, 5, and 2, which is more than three.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 5.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 2, which is less than three.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 9, 2, and 5, which is more than three.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 9, 5, and 0, which is more than three.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 6.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 2.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, 6, and 2, which is more than three.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 3, 8, and 5, which is more than three.
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 6, which is less than three.

2. Based on the above analysis, we have three 3-stars in the given graph:
   - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
   - <3, (6, 8, 2)>
   - <5, (7, 3, 6)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
