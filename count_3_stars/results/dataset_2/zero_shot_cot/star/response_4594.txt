Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 8) (14, 7) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (1, 11) (1, 5) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 2) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 17) (6, 16) (6, 4) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 18) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 10) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 4) (10, 7) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 3) (19, 17) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (15, 12, 2)>
<1, (11, 5, 8)>
<2, (5, 0, 16)>
<3, (19, 8, 4)>
<4, (10, 6, 3)>
<5, (1, 7, 2)>
<6, (4, 10, 16)>
<7, (14, 5, 10)>
<8, (11, 18, 3)>
<9, (17, 12, 18)>
<13, (15, 12, 18)>
<14, (7, 8, 0)>
<15, (0, 13, 18)>
<16, (6, 8, 2)>
<17, (9, 6, 19)>
<18, (9, 8, 13)>
<19, (17, 3, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we find that there are [17] 3-stars.
