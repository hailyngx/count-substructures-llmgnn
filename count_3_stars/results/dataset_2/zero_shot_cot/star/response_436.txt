Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star pattern. 
We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the list of edges provided, the potential central nodes are 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9. 
Given that the center must have exactly 3 edges, we can eliminate nodes with fewer or more than 3 connections. 

Therefore, the potential central nodes are 1, 2, 4, and 9. 

Let's now list the 3-stars that can be formed from the given graph:

<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get [7].
