Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 24) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 27) (26, 7) (3, 16) (3, 27) (3, 22) (15, 19) (0, 27) (0, 4) (0, 19) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 0) (27, 13) (13, 27) (13, 22) (13, 25) (22, 3) (22, 13) (22, 14) (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 11) (16, 6) (2, 18) (2, 10) (29, 8) (29, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 23) (7, 26) (7, 24) (7, 23) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 8) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 5) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 7) (24, 14) (5, 28) (5, 8) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 7) (23, 10) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 23) (10, 21) (21, 10) (21, 17) (21, 14) (17, 11) (17, 21) (17, 25) (25, 13) (25, 29) (25, 17) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 4) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 4) (8, 29) (8, 12) (8, 5) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 24) (14, 21) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

1. The center node 9 has three connected nodes: 24, 16, and 26. So, we have one 3-star: <9, (24, 16, 26)>.

2. The center node 26 has three connected nodes: 9, 24, and 27. So, we have one 3-star: <26, (9, 24, 27)>.

3. The center node 3 has three connected nodes: 16, 27, and 22. So, we have one 3-star: <3, (16, 27, 22)>.

4. The center node 27 has three connected nodes: 26, 3, and 0. So, we have one 3-star: <27, (26, 3, 0)>.

5. The center node 13 has three connected nodes: 22, 25, and 27. So, we have one 3-star: <13, (22, 25, 27)>.

6. The center node 16 has three connected nodes: 9, 3, and 11. So, we have one 3-star: <16, (9, 3, 11)>.

7. The center node 22 has three connected nodes: 13, 14, and 3. So, we have one 3-star: <22, (13, 14, 3)>.

8. The center node 11 has three connected nodes: 16, 23, and 17. So, we have one 3-star: <11, (16, 23, 17)>.

9. The center node 2 has three connected nodes: 18, 10, and none of them form a 3-star since they need to have exactly three connections.

10. Similarly, we can check each remaining node to find if they form 3-stars.

Upon checking for all nodes, we find a total of [8] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
