Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 5) (16, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 3) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with edges to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars. 

Based on the given edges, the potential center nodes are: 
- Node 11 (connected to 4 nodes: 19, 18, 17, 2)
- Node 2 (connected to 4 nodes: 11, 8, 19, 14)
- Node 17 (connected to 3 nodes: 11, 1, 13)
- Node 5 (connected to 4 nodes: 16, 7, 12, 10)
- Node 4 (connected to 3 nodes: 7, 9, 15)
- Node 16 (connected to 2 nodes: 5, 6)
- Node 7 (connected to 3 nodes: 4, 15, 5)
- Node 1 (connected to 3 nodes: 17, 6, 14)
- Node 9 (connected to 4 nodes: 4, 8, 15, 13)
- Node 13 (connected to 3 nodes: 17, 9, 14)
- Node 6 (connected to 3 nodes: 16, 1, 0)

Next, we need to check each potential center node to see if it forms a 3-star with exactly three other nodes.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph: [1]

Therefore, the unique 3-star found is <11, (19, 18, 17)>.
