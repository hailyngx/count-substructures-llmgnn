Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list out the 3-stars present in the graph:

<4, (7, 5, 11)>
<7, (4, 12, 3)>
<8, (14, 6, 13)>
<13, (12, 1, 6)>
<12, (7, 13, 10)>
<5, (4, 7, 11)>
<6, (8, 13, 14)>
<2, (4, 10, 11)>
<1, (13, 6, 14)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<10, (4, 12, 2)>
<3, (7, 13, 10)>
<11, (4, 5, 2)>
<14, (8, 6, 1)>
<9, (2, 0, 11)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph, thus the final count is [15].
