Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 17) (10, 0) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 13) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (1, 6) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 11) (19, 8) (19, 9) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 9) (18, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 12) (9, 19) (9, 18) (15, 18) (15, 12) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to find the number of 3-stars. 

1. Count the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors (14, 7, 10, 2, 18)
- Node 1: 1 neighbor (6)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (5, 0, 12, 13)
- Node 3: 1 neighbor (13)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (14, 7, 8, 11)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (6, 2)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (7, 5, 1, 16)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (17, 4, 0, 6)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (4, 16, 19, 18)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (19, 18)
- Node 10: 2 neighbors (17, 0)
- Node 11: 2 neighbors (4, 13)
- Node 12: 3 neighbors (2, 16, 15)
- Node 13: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 11)
- Node 14: 4 neighbors (17, 0, 4, 16)
- Node 15: 2 neighbors (18, 12)
- Node 16: 4 neighbors (14, 6, 8, 12)
- Node 17: 3 neighbors (14, 10, 7)
- Node 18: 4 neighbors (8, 0, 9, 15)
- Node 19: 2 neighbors (8, 9)

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (7, 10, 14)>
- <2, (0, 12, 13)>
- <3, (2, 11, 13)>
- <4, (7, 11, 14)>
- <5, (2, 5, 6)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 8, 16)>
- <16, (6, 8, 14)>
- <13, (2, 11, 13)>
- <14, (0, 16, 17)>
