Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 0) (11, 27) (11, 6) (16, 13) (16, 25) (13, 16) (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 17) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 20) (7, 17) (2, 4) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 18) (20, 7) (20, 21) (20, 10) (25, 16) (25, 28) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 14) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 15) (26, 17) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 10) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 9) (28, 25) (28, 26) (12, 2) (12, 1) (12, 24) (10, 20) (10, 0) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 27) (24, 9) (15, 26) (15, 23) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 23) (17, 22) (17, 7) (17, 26) (17, 6) (5, 3) (5, 23) (5, 21) (23, 15) (23, 6) (23, 5) (23, 21) (8, 27) (21, 20) (21, 5) (21, 23) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided and then count them.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:

<11, (24, 0, 27)>
<13, (16, 22, 4)>
<13, (7, 0, 4)>
<22, (13, 17, 4)>
<4, (13, 7, 2)>
<7, (13, 17, 20)>
<29, (2, 18, 14)>
<20, (7, 10, 21)>
<16, (13, 25, 28)>
<3, (1, 5, 23)>
<1, (3, 12, 24)>
<18, (29, 19, 14)>
<26, (19, 17, 28)>
<5, (3, 21, 23)>
<28, (25, 26, 17)>
<12, (2, 1, 24)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]
