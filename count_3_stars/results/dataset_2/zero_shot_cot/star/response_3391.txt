Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [10]
  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (3, 10, 14)>
<9, (6, 7, 14)>
<6, (4, 12, 13)>
<4, (6, 13, 14)>
<7, (9, 3, 8)>
<8, (7, 2, 13)>
<13, (6, 4, 8)>
<2, (8, 10, 12)>
<0, (4, 8, 11)>
<12, (6, 8, 2)>
