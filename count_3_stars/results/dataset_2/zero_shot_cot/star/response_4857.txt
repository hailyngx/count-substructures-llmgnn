Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 10) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 0. This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the center.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 2, and 12. This forms a 3-star with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 8. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 14. This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 14, and 10. This forms a 3-star with node 0 as the center.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 0, and 7. This forms a 3-star with node 14 as the center.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 2. This forms a 3-star with node 11 as the center.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 4. This forms a 3-star with node 13 as the center.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 0, and 10. This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 14. This forms a 3-star with node 7 as the center.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6. This forms a 3-star with node 12 as the center.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 0, and 11. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center.

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of <1, (11, 12, 8)>, <3, (11, 7, 0)>, <5, (13, 2, 12)>, <6, (7, 12, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 14)>, <0, (3, 14, 10)>, <14, (2, 0, 7)>, <11, (1, 3, 2)>, <13, (3, 5, 4)>, <9, (8, 0, 10)>, <7, (3, 6, 14)>, <12, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 0, 11)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is counted to be [13].
