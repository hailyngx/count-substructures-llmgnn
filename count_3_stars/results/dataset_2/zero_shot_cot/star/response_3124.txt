Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 4) (27, 10) (27, 3) (27, 9) (27, 5) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 12) (8, 28) (8, 29) (23, 11) (23, 1) (10, 27) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 22) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 26) (26, 17) (26, 28) (26, 14) (28, 8) (28, 26) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 1) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 22) (2, 6) (22, 10) (22, 2) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 14) (14, 26) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 24) (12, 20) (12, 25) (12, 19) (9, 27) (9, 18) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 3) (4, 15) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 3) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (1, 20) (1, 23) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (5, 27) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 24) (3, 27) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 29) (0, 21) (0, 24) (21, 18) (21, 0) (24, 14) (24, 5) (24, 0) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 13) (13, 16) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes with exactly three edges. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars. 

The nodes with exactly three edges are: 0, 4, 8, 13, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23. 

Now, let's check each potential center to see if they form a 3-star.

For node 0, there are no 3-stars.
For node 4, there is 1 unique 3-star: <4, (15, 27, 9)>.
For node 8, there are no 3-stars.
For node 13, there are no 3-stars.
For node 15, there is 1 unique 3-star: <15, (4, 27, 5)>.
For node 20, there are 2 unique 3-stars: <20, (25, 1, 12)> and <20, (25, 5, 12)>.
For node 21, there are no 3-stars.
For node 22, there is 1 unique 3-star: <22, (10, 2, 6)>.
For node 23, there is 1 unique 3-star: <23, (11, 1, 19)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 6.
