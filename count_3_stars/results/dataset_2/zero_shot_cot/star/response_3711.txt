Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 2) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 15) (6, 1) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (19, 3) (19, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 18) (16, 5) (16, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star. To be a part of a 3-star, a node must have degree at least 3.

Nodes with degree >= 3: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Now we will examine each of these nodes to see if they are a part of a 3-star by checking their neighbors.

Nodes with neighbors forming a 3-star:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 14)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (5, 15, 17)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (13, 17, 2)>
- Node 5 forms 2 3-stars: <5, (9, 1, 3)> and <5, (16, 9, 3)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (3, 18, 14)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star: <17, (3, 4, 1)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star: <18, (15, 9, 7)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (3, 0, 0)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
