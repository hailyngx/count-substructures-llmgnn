Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 24) (9, 3) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 23) (22, 18) (22, 12) (8, 9) (8, 23) (8, 24) (23, 18) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 29) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 10) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 25) (4, 20) (4, 29) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 1) (28, 2) (28, 11) (28, 14) (17, 5) (17, 20) (17, 21) (20, 4) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 26) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 24) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 20) (14, 12) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 19) (3, 9) (3, 0) (29, 23) (29, 4) (29, 25) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 2) (24, 16) (24, 15) (1, 23) (1, 11) (1, 19) (15, 24) (15, 25) (26, 0) (26, 25) (21, 17) (21, 27) (27, 6) (27, 20) (27, 21) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 19) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 15) (25, 26) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Checking the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars:
- <9, (6, 8, 18)>
- <18, (9, 23, 22)>
- <22, (18, 12, 27)>
- <8, (9, 23, 24)>
- <23, (8, 18, 1)>
- <5, (6, 17, 10)>
- <2, (24, 28, 25)>
- <4, (20, 29, 14)>
- <11, (28, 14, 1)>
- <17, (5, 20, 21)>
- <0, (7, 3, 26)>
- <7, (0, 16, 13)>
- <16, (7, 12, 24)>
- <12, (22, 16, 14)>
- <3, (9, 0, 19)>
- <29, (23, 4, 25)>
- <24, (9, 8, 16)>
- <1, (23, 11, 19)>
- <25, (2, 29, 15)>
- <26, (0, 25, 3)>
- <21, (17, 27, 20)>
- <13, (7, 19, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
