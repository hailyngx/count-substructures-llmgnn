Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 19) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 12) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 18) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph. As a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Examining the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (4, 7, 11)>
<3, (17, 6, 0)>
<6, (3, 0, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<11, (5, 1, 10)>
<12, (9, 13, 18)>
<13, (8, 1, 15)>
<15, (0, 5, 18)>
<18, (0, 12, 19)>
<19, (8, 13, 18)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
