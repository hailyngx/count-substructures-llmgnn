Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
The central nodes must have exactly three edges to form a 3-star. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (9, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (4, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 3)>
4. <6, (7, 1, 3)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
