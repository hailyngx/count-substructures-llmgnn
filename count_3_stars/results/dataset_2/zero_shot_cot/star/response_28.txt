Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 11) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.
Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<4, (7, 3, 13)>
<7, (4, 0, 11)>
<1, (7, 3, 5)>
<3, (4, 1, 13)>
<8, (7, 5, 13)>
<13, (4, 3, 8)>
<10, (1, 6, 5)>
<11, (7, 13, 0)>
<6, (10, 2, -not applicable)>
<9, (7, 3, 12)>
<5, (1, 8, 10)>
<2, (10, 6, 12)>
<0, (7, 11, 14)>
<14, (3, 2, 0)>
<12, (1, 13, 9)>

Counting them, we find there are [14] 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.
