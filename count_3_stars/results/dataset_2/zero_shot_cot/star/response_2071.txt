Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<4, (9, 7, 12)>
