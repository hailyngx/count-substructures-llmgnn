Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 12) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 10) (5, 13) (5, 9) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 1) (17, 9) (17, 14) (18, 22) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 8) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 25) (0, 1) (19, 29) (19, 28) (19, 6) (26, 11) (21, 18) (21, 28) (21, 24) (28, 19) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 2) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 20) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 4) (7, 28) (7, 24) (7, 10) (2, 28) (2, 3) (2, 20) (12, 13) (12, 29) (25, 0) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 20) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 1) (20, 23) (6, 19) (6, 10) (6, 15) (8, 14) (8, 18) (29, 19) (29, 12) (29, 23) (27, 22) (27, 5) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 24) (24, 21) (24, 7) (24, 10) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 4) (4, 16) (4, 23) (15, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming the 3-stars in the graph:

Node 9: (5, 11, 17)  
Node 14: (0, 1, 17)  
Node 16: (0, 4, 22)  
Node 17: (9, 14, 0)  
Node 18: (1, 8, 22)  
Node 20: (1, 2, 11)  
Node 22: (16, 18, 27)  
Node 28: (2, 7, 21)  

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.  

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is: [8]  
The unique 3-stars found are: <9, (5, 11, 17)>, <14, (0, 1, 17)>, <16, (0, 4, 22)>, <17, (9, 14, 0)>, <18, (1, 8, 22)>, <20, (1, 2, 11)>, <22, (16, 18, 27)>, <28, (2, 7, 21)>.
