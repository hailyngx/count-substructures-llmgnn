Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 4) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 6) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 26) (8, 23) (8, 16) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 5) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 24) (2, 26) (18, 6) (18, 19) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 5) (20, 27) (20, 0) (20, 13) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 5) (21, 22) (21, 29) (28, 0) (28, 21) (11, 15) (11, 1) (11, 12) (22, 9) (22, 8) (22, 21) (22, 12) (22, 25) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (25, 22) (29, 21) (29, 12) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 16) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 26) (14, 12) (14, 24) (26, 15) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 14) (19, 18) (16, 8) (16, 10) (17, 9) (17, 3) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 21) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 14) (13, 9) (13, 20) (13, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. Let's start with listing the unique 3-stars:

<4, (1, 15, 24)>
<7, (0, 14, 21)>
<10, (7, 13, 16)>
<13, (9, 10, 20)>
<15, (1, 4, 24)>
<16, (8, 10, 16)>
<18, (6, 19, 18)>
<20, (13, 20, 27)>
<21, (10, 21, 28)>
<22, (8, 12, 22)>
<26, (2, 14, 26)>
<27, (6, 15, 20)>
<28, (0, 21, 28)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique 3-stars we have found. 
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [13].
