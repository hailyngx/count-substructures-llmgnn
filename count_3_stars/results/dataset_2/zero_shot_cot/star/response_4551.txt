Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 12) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 6) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 5) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 12) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 5) (18, 1) (4, 3) (4, 11) (13, 9) (14, 10) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (9, 16, 18)>
<2, (7, 8, 17)>
<4, (3, 11, 15)>
<5, (8, 12, 16)>
<6, (1, 12, 19)>
<9, (1, 8, 13)>
<10, (12, 14, 19)>
<11, (4, 7, 15)>
<12, (5, 6, 8)>
<14, (10, 15, 19)>
<15, (11, 14, 7)>
<16, (0, 5, 14)>
<17, (2, 8, 9)>
<18, (1)>
<19, (6, 8, 14)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars found in the graph, so the answer is [14].
