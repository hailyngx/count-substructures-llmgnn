Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 5 is connected to (1, 2, 4, 8, 9).
   There are no 3-stars with node 5 as the center because it has 5 edges connected to it.
   
2. Node 9 is connected to (1, 5, 7).
   <9, (1, 5, 7)> is a 3-star.

3. Node 6 is connected to (0, 1, 2, 7).
   There are no 3-stars with node 6 as the center because it has 4 edges connected to it.
   
4. Node 1 is connected to (3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9).
   There are no 3-stars with node 1 as the center because it has 6 edges connected to it.
   
5. Node 3 is connected to (0, 1, 4).
   There are no 3-stars with node 3 as the center because it has 3 edges connected to it.
   
6. Node 4 is connected to (1, 3, 5, 7, 8).
   There are no 3-stars with node 4 as the center because it has 5 edges connected to it.
   
7. Node 7 is connected to (2, 4, 6, 9).
   There are no 3-stars with node 7 as the center because it has 4 edges connected to it.
   
8. Node 8 is connected to (0, 1, 4, 5).
   There are no 3-stars with node 8 as the center because it has 4 edges connected to it.
   
9. Node 2 is connected to (5, 6, 7).
   <2, (5, 6, 7)> is a 3-star.
   
10. Node 0 is connected to (3, 6, 8).
   There are no 3-stars with node 0 as the center because it has 3 edges connected to it.
   
Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is only [2] as identified in the steps above. The 3-stars found are <9, (1, 5, 7)> and <2, (5, 6, 7)>.
