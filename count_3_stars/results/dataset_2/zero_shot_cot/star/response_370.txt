Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 14) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 15) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 17) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (15, 7) (15, 10) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by checking each node as the center node and counting the number of 3-stars formed with that node. The number of 3-stars can be represented as the number of unique combinations of nodes connected to the center node. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 0: <0, (5, 8, 14)>, <0, (5, 8, 19)>, <0, (5, 14, 19)>, <0, (8, 10, 15)>
2. Node 1: <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 12)>
3. Node 2: No 3-star can be formed from Node 2.
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 9, 12)>, <3, (1, 12, 18)>, <3, (9, 12, 18)>
5. Node 4: <4, (1, 5, 10)>, <4, (1, 10, 12)>, <4, (5, 10, 14)>
6. Node 5: No 3-star can be formed from Node 5.
7. Node 6: No 3-star can be formed from Node 6.
8. Node 7: No 3-star can be formed from Node 7.
9. Node 8: No 3-star can be formed from Node 8.
10. Node 9: No 3-star can be formed from Node 9.
11. Node 10: No 3-star can be formed from Node 10.
12. Node 11: <11, (0, 17, 19)>
13. Node 12: <12, (1, 3, 9)>, <12, (1, 3, 13)>, <12, (1, 9, 13)>
14. Node 13: No 3-star can be formed from Node 13.
15. Node 14: No 3-star can be formed from Node 14.
16. Node 15: No 3-star can be formed from Node 15.
17. Node 16: No 3-star can be formed from Node 16.
18. Node 17: No 3-star can be formed from Node 17.
19. Node 18: No 3-star can be formed from Node 18.
20. Node 19: No 3-star can be formed from Node 19.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (5, 8, 14)>, <0, (5, 8, 19)>, <0, (5, 14, 19)>, <0, (8, 10, 15)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 12)>, <3, (1, 9, 12)>, <3, (1, 12, 18)>, <3, (9, 12, 18)>, <4, (1, 5, 10)>, <4, (1, 10, 12)>, <4, (5, 10, 14)>, <11, (0, 17, 19)> Inside brackets [].
