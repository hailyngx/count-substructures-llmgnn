Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 15) (18, 10) (18, 24) (22, 3) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 13) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 25) (17, 28) (17, 2) (1, 25) (1, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 27) (8, 29) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 27) (9, 8) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 23) (6, 0) (24, 18) (24, 3) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 15) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 25) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 3) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 24) (3, 10) (23, 16) (23, 2) (23, 4) (20, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 15) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 12) (25, 21) (25, 28) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 14) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 8) (13, 28) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 13) (2, 21) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 23) 

Response:
Let's first identify the possible 3-star configurations in the given graph:

1. Node 3 is the center connected to nodes 22, 8, and 10. (<3, (22, 8, 10)>)
2. Node 7 is the center connected to nodes 21, 16, and 15. (<7, (21, 16, 15)>)
3. Node 8 is the center connected to nodes 29, 9, and 27. (<8, (29, 9, 27)>)
4. Node 15 is the center connected to nodes 12, 21, and 11. (<15, (12, 21, 11)>)
5. Node 16 is the center connected to nodes 2, 13, and 23. (<16, (2, 13, 23)>)
6. Node 21 is the center connected to nodes 7, 27, and 25. (<21, (7, 27, 25)>)
7. Node 25 is the center connected to nodes 14, 28, and 1. (<25, (14, 28, 1)>)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[7]
