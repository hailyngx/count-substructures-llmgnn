Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
- First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
  - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 8.
  - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8.
  - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7, and 9.
  - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
  - Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.

- Since we are looking for 3-stars, the center node must have exactly 3 neighbors.

- There are two possibilities for the count of 3-stars in this graph:
  - If the center node is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7 (e.g., 0 is the center node), then the 3-stars can be formed with leaves (1, 5, 7) and (3, 5, 7), but these stars are not valid since 3 nodes have connections with each other, which does not meet the definition of a 3-star.
  - If the center node is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8 (e.g., 2 is the center node), then the valid 3-star in the graph is <2, (3, 6, 8)>.

- Therefore, there is [1] unique 3-star in the given graph: <2, (3, 6, 8)>.
