Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can consider each node as a potential center of a 3-star and check if it has three neighbors connected to it.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0 has three neighbors (2, 4, 6) connected to it. So, <0, (2, 4, 6)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has three neighbors (5, 7, 8) connected to it. So, <1, (5, 7, 8)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
