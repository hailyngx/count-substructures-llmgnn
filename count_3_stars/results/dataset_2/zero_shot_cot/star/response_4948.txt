Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- The center node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 1. <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- The center node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 1. <9, (5, 8, 1)>
- The center node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 6. <4, (5, 2, 6)>
- The center node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 6. <8, (9, 2, 6)>
- The center node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 1. <6, (5, 8, 1)>
- The center node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 8. <2, (9, 4, 8)>
- The center node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6. <1, (5, 9, 6)>
- The center node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 6, and 0. <3, (8, 6, 0)>
- The center node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1. <7, (5, 9, 1)>
- The center node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 3. <0, (6, 2, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
