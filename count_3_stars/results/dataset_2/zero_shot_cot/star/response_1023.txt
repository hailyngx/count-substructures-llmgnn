Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 2, 11)>
<4, (5, 11, 13)>
<3, (9, 7, 11)>
<11, (5, 4, 0)>
<8, (11, 14, 10)>
<0, (9, 11, 13)>
<10, (8, 0, 14)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 12)>
<14, (8, 1, 12)>
<1, (7, 14, 12)>

There are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars found are listed below:
<5, (9, 2, 11)>
<4, (5, 11, 13)>
<3, (9, 7, 11)>
<11, (5, 4, 0)>
<8, (11, 14, 10)>
<0, (9, 11, 13)>
<10, (8, 0, 14)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 12)>
<14, (8, 1, 12)>
<1, (7, 14, 12)>
