Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 25) (7, 2) (21, 4) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 4) (10, 25) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 29) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 18) (20, 16) (12, 27) (12, 16) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 23) (1, 14) (1, 26) (1, 11) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 5) (13, 26) (13, 2) (5, 26) (5, 15) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 23) (25, 7) (25, 10) (25, 17) (16, 20) (16, 12) (16, 28) (16, 19) (15, 5) (15, 18) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 22) (3, 29) (18, 20) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 24) (22, 10) (22, 3) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 24) (2, 7) (2, 13) (11, 1) (11, 18) (24, 19) (24, 8) (24, 29) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 10) (23, 14) (23, 28) (29, 0) (29, 3) (29, 24) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star in this graph. To be the central node of a 3-star, a node must have exactly three neighbors.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 6, 9, 20)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 6, 27, 22)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 9, 21, 10)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 9, 25, 2)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 20, 12, 28)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 20, 15, 19)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 1, 13, 28)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: <0, (6, 9, 20)>
- For Node 3: <3, (6, 27, 22)>
- For Node 4: <4, (9, 21, 10)>
- For Node 7: <7, (9, 25, 2)>
- For Node 16: <16, (20, 12, 28)>
- For Node 18: <18, (20, 15, 19)>
- For Node 26: <26, (1, 13, 28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
