Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 7, 5)>
<1, (4, 12, 14)>
<2, (9, 8, 12)>
<3, (6, 10, 0)>
<4, (7, 11, 1)>
<5, (6, 7, 14)>

Now, we have found all the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Counting these 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
