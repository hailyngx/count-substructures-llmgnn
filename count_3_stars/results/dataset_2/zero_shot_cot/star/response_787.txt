The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 9) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (23, 25) (23, 24) (12, 15) (12, 22) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 9) (21, 27) (21, 13) (28, 27) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 20) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 10) (17, 0) (17, 22) (5, 19) (5, 29) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 25) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 13) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 29) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 20) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (29, 5) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 6) (11, 2) (11, 20) (11, 25) (9, 3) (9, 27) (9, 2) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 11) (25, 22) (13, 21) (13, 18) (13, 4) (14, 8) (14, 24) (14, 7) (14, 20) (6, 2) (6, 29) (6, 22) (4, 15) (4, 13) (22, 12) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 6) (20, 24) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern based on the given edges:

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 24, and 9.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 26, 12, 4, and 2.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 3, 23, 26, 14, and 20.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 21, 28, and 9.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 27 and 13.
- Node 28 is connected to node 27.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 18, 16, 29, and 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 26, 18, 0, and 20.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 15, 9, 6, and 11.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3 and 25.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 13.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7 and 29.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 17, and 10.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 15, 24, and 10.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 12, 17, 25, and 6.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 8, 24, 7, and 20.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 16, and 6.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 25, and 20.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 27, and 2.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 23, 19, 11, and 22.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 21, 18, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 29, 22, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 19 and 29.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 15 and 13.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 15 and 22.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 14 and 0.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 0 and 22.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 24, 10, 11, and 14.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: 

<3, (15, 24, 9)>, <15, (3, 12, 4)>, <24, (3, 23, 26)>, <9, (3, 27, 2)>, <27, (21, 28, 9)>, <21, (27, 13)>, <7, (18, 16, 29)>, <10, (26, 18, 0)>, <2, (15, 9, 6)>, <19, (3, 25)>, <18, (10, 7, 13)>, <16, (7, 29)>, <0, (8, 17)>, <26, (15, 24, 10)>, <22, (12, 17, 25)>, <14, (8, 7, 20)>, <29, (5, 7, 16)>, <11, (2, 25, 20)>
