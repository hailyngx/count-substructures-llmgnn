Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes of degree 1, which are the leaves of the 3-stars. Nodes 0, 3, and 5 have degree 1. 

Next, we can analyze each of these nodes to find the 3-stars. Let's start with node 0:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 8. Node 0 cannot be a center of any 3-star since it has degree 1. 

Now, let's move on to node 3:

Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8. Node 3 also cannot be the center of any 3-star since it has degree 1. 

Finally, let's look at node 5:

Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 1. This forms a 3-star with center node 5 and leaves 6, 8, and 1. 
So, the unique 3-star we found is <5, (6, 8, 1)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
