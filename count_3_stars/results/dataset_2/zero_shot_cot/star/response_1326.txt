Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes are candidates for being the center of a 3-star graph. 

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them: 
- Node 0 (edges: 7, 1, 3, 6, 2)
- Node 1 (edges: 3, 6, 0)
- Node 5 (edges: 2, 3)
- Node 8 (edges: 4, 3, 2) 

Now, let's construct the 3-star graphs for each candidate center: 

For Node 0:
<0, (7, 1, 3)>
<0, (7, 3, 6)>
<0, (7, 3, 2)>
<0, (1, 3, 2)>
[4]

For Node 1:
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
[1]

For Node 5:
<5, (2, 3, 0)>
[1]

For Node 8:
<8, (4, 3, 2)>
[1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
