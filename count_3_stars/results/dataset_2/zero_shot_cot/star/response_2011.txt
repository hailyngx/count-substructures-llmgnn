Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 12) (22, 3) (4, 27) (4, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (1, 26) (1, 2) (1, 0) (26, 18) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 13) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 24) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 5) (19, 26) (19, 10) (13, 26) (13, 24) (13, 15) (13, 7) (6, 22) (6, 21) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 15) (16, 9) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 11) (29, 9) (29, 14) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 7) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (27, 4) (27, 21) (27, 5) (0, 22) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 12) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (17, 28) (5, 28) (5, 23) (5, 27) (5, 7) (25, 2) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 24) (2, 14) (3, 22) (3, 4) (3, 14) (14, 29) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 24) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 10) (24, 21) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three edges, as they could potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are: 
- Node 18
- Node 22
- Node 4
- Node 8
- Node 21
- Node 3
- Node 20
- Node 16
- Node 9
- Node 29
- Node 11
- Node 23
- Node 0
- Node 10
- Node 7
- Node 17
- Node 25
- Node 12

Next, let's form 3-stars for each of the potential center nodes: 

<18, (22, 26, 16)>
<22, (18, 6, 12)>
<4, (27, 3, X)> (4 only has 2 leaves connected)
<8, (15, 12, X)> (8 only has 2 leaves connected)
<21, (28, 6, 27)>
<3, (22, 4, 14)>
<20, (X, X, X)> (20 doesn't have enough connected edges)
<16, (18, 28, 15)>
<9, (16, 29, 11)>
<29, (9, 14, X)> (29 only has 2 leaves connected)
<11, (9, 23, 7)>
<23, (11, 5, 14)>
<0, (22, 1, 10)>
<10, (19, 0, 12)>
<7, (13, 11, 5)>
<17, (28, X, X)> (17 only has 1 leaf connected)
<25, (2, X, X)> (25 only has 1 leaf connected)
<12, (22, 8, 10)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
