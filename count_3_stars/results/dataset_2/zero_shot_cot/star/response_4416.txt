Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 0: <0, (3, 4, 6)>
- From node 2: <2, (4, 9, 8)>
- From node 8: <8, (9, 7, 6)>
- From node 9: <9, (2, 8, 3)>
- From node 1: <1, (9, 6, 5)>
- From node 6: <6, (0, 8, 1)>
- From node 3: <3, (0, 9, 7)>
- From node 7: <7, (8, 1, 5)>
- From node 5: <5, (8, 1, 4)>
- From node 4: <4, (0, 2, 5)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
