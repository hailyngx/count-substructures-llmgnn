Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 11) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be calculated by counting the number of occurrences of each node as the center of the star. 

Here is the breakdown of 3-star graphs with unique centers:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (9, 11, 13)>
<7, (2, 3, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<10, (0, 4, 12)>
<11, (6, 11, 13)>
<12, (4, 7, 10)>
<13, (0, 7, 11)>
<14, (0, 1, 7)>

The total number of 3-star graphs is: [14].
