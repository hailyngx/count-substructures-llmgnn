Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all occurrences of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the given edges and find the 3-stars:

1. (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) <6, (9, 14, 12)> 
2. (9, 8) (9, 4) <9, (8, 4, 6)> 
3. (4, 7) (7, 11) <7, (4, 11, 13)> 
4. (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) <10, (11, 8, 5)> 
5. (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) <11, (3, 1, 10)> 
6. (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) <8, (9, 10, 11)> 
7. (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) <13, (6, 7, 8)> 
8. (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) <0, (11, 8, 2)> 
9. (2, 4) (2, 0) <2, (4, 0, 6)>
10. (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 0) <3, (11, 13, 0)> 
11. (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 13) <5, (4, 10, 13)> 
12. (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 13) <12, (6, 4, 13)> 
13. (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) <1, (4, 11, 14)> 

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 13 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [13].
