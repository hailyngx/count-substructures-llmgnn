Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 3) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 19) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 21) (10, 17) (10, 26) (17, 10) (17, 26) (17, 21) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 25) (15, 20) (20, 5) (20, 15) (20, 8) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 26) (28, 11) (28, 8) (28, 1) (28, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 11) (25, 18) (25, 2) (25, 26) (25, 23) (1, 28) (1, 8) (1, 7) (6, 22) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 29) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 18) (19, 4) (8, 0) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 1) (8, 21) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 4) (26, 10) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 25) (26, 7) (13, 28) (13, 21) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 13) (4, 19) (4, 24) (7, 1) (7, 26) (29, 12) (29, 16) (16, 9) (16, 29) (23, 25) (14, 5) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. Each 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the possible 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 14), (5, 20)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 16), (9, 3)
- Node 0: (0, 27), (0, 3), (0, 8)
- Node 27: (27, 0), (27, 21), (27, 19)
- Node 18: (18, 22), (18, 2), (18, 19)
- Node 22: (22, 18), (22, 6), (22, 21)
- Node 2: (2, 18), (2, 12), (2, 25)
- Node 20: (20, 5), (20, 8), (20, 15)
- Node 11: (11, 28), (11, 3), (11, 24)
- Node 28: (28, 11), (28, 8), (28, 1)
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 0), (3, 11)
- Node 25: (25, 18), (25, 2), (25, 26)
- Node 1: (1, 28), (1, 8), (1, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 22)
- Node 12: (12, 2), (12, 24), (12, 14)
- Node 19: (19, 0), (19, 27), (19, 18)
- Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 20), (8, 28)
- Node 24: (24, 11), (24, 12), (24, 4)
- Node 26: (26, 10), (26, 17), (26, 11)
- Node 13: (13, 28), (13, 21)
- Node 21: (21, 27), (21, 22), (21, 17)
- Node 4: (4, 19), (4, 24)
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 26)
- Node 29: (29, 12), (29, 16)
- Node 16: (16, 9), (16, 29)
- Node 23: (23, 25)

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<5, (9, 14, 20)>
<9, (5, 16, 3)>
<0, (27, 3, 8)>
<27, (0, 21, 19)>
<18, (22, 2, 19)>
<22, (18, 6, 21)>
<2, (18, 12, 25)>
<20, (5, 8, 15)>
<11, (28, 3, 24)>
<28, (11, 8, 1)>
<3, (9, 0, 11)>
<25, (18, 2, 26)>
<1, (28, 8, 7)>
<12, (2, 24, 14)>
<19, (0, 27, 18)>
<8, (0, 20, 28)>
<24, (11, 12, 4)>
<26, (10, 17, 11)>
<13, (28, 21)>
<21, (27, 22, 17)>
<4, (19, 24)>
<7, (1, 26)>
<29, (12, 16)>
<16, (9, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
