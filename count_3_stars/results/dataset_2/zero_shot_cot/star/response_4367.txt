Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 19) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 12) (0, 11) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 15) (14, 3) (16, 18) (16, 1) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 15) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 2, 13)>
<13, (9, 12, 10)>
<10, (13, 11, 7)>
<11, (10, 0, 4)>
<2, (9, 11, 18)>
<18, (2, 4, 16)>
<4, (11, 12, 6)>
<12, (8, 13, 4)>
<1, (6, 16, 0)>
<6, (2, 4, 1)>
<15, (7, 14, 15)>
<19, (12, 19, 19)>
<0, (11, 1, 0)>
<3, (5, 14, 3)>
<14, (10, 15, 14)>
<16, (18, 1, 16)>
<17, (4, 17, 17)>
<7, (5, 13, 10)>

Counting these 3-stars, we have a total of [19] 3-stars in the graph.
