Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with degree 3 since the central node of a 3-star graph has degree 3. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 2, and 3 have degree 3.

Next, let's check the neighbors of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars. We will check each node with degree 3, and count the total number of 3-stars. 

For node 1:
- <1, (5, 9, 7)> is a 3-star.
- <1, (5, 3, 8)> is a 3-star.

For node 2:
- <2, (5, 6, 4)> is a 3-star.
- <2, (6, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.

For node 3:
- <3, (6, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.
- <3, (1, 4, 7)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.
