Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 1) (7, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 12) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 0) (19, 17) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 17) (6, 17) (6, 12) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and list the unique 3-stars, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
2. For each central node, find its adjacent nodes connected by edges to form the 3-stars.
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars generated.

Starting with step 1:

Nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 5
- Node 2
- Node 18
- Node 0
- Node 19

Moving on to step 2 to find the unique 3-stars:

- Central node 5: (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 15), (5, 16)
  <5, (2, 13, 15)> => already counted
  <5, (2, 13, 16)> => already counted
  <5, (15, 13, 16)> => already counted
  So, a total of 1 unique 3-star for central node 5.
  
- Central node 2: (2, 5), (2, 18), (2, 0)
  <2, (5, 18, 0)> => already counted
  So, a total of 0 unique 3-stars for central node 2.

- Central node 18: (18, 2), (18, 19), (18, 0)
  <18, (2, 19, 0)> => already counted
  So, a total of 0 unique 3-stars for central node 18.

- Central node 0: (0, 2), (0, 18), (0, 14)
  <0, (2, 18, 14)> => already counted
  So, a total of 0 unique 3-stars for central node 0.

- Central node 19: (19, 4), (19, 18), (19, 17)
  <19, (4, 18, 17)> => already counted
  So, a total of 0 unique 3-stars for central node 19.

Finally, counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph [1].
