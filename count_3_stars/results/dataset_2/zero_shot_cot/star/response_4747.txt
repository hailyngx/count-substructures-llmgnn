Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 19) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 13) (8, 19) (9, 11) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 13) (15, 0) (4, 13) (4, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 4) (6, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can see the following nodes have degree 3:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 3, and 7.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 16, and 19.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 1, and 6.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 17, 11, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 16, and 4.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 13.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- For Node 14: <14, (17, 3, 7)>
- For Node 17: <17, (14, 16, 19)>
- For Node 10: <10, (11, 12, 7)>
- For Node 11: <11, (10, 7, 19)>
- For Node 2: <2, (18, 1, 6)>
- For Node 19: <19, (17, 11, 0)>
- For Node 6: <6, (2, 16, 4)>
- For Node 12: <12, (10, 3, 13)>
- For Node 13: <13, (0, 1, 4)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
So, the count of 3-star patterns is [9].
