Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 15) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 2) (22, 11) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 13) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 14) (29, 11) (29, 24) (19, 15) (19, 25) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 13) (26, 28) (26, 19) (1, 10) (17, 11) (17, 9) (3, 2) (21, 9) (21, 24) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (9, 17) (9, 21) (18, 24) (18, 0) (7, 28) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 15) (14, 28) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 5) (5, 20) (5, 25) (5, 12) (5, 4) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 8) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 3) (13, 27) (13, 23) (13, 19) (13, 14) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 21) (24, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:
<11, (16, 22, 17)>
<16, (11, 12, 2)>
<15, (16, 27, 19)>
<27, (15, 10, 13)>
<20, (25, 2, 24)>
<25, (20, 5, 19)>
<22, (11, 23, 13)>
<23, (22, 13, 0)>
<28, (26, 7, 14)>
<29, (11, 24, 29)>
<19, (15, 25, 26)>
<26, (28, 19, 13)>
<17, (11, 9, 21)>
<9, (17, 21, 12)>
<18, (24, 0, 8)>
<7, (28, 14, 6)>
<6, (14, 8, 6)>
<14, (15, 28, 6)>
<4, (19, 14, 5)>
<5, (20, 25, 12)>
<10, (27, 1, 8)>
<1, (10, 10, 10)>
<8, (6, 10, 0)>
<0, (12, 18, 0)>
<3, (2, 3, 3)>

There are 24 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [24].
