Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 9) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 19) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 24) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 9) (27, 7) (27, 9) (5, 23) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (22, 26) (22, 0) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 10) (28, 25) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 7) (17, 20) (17, 12) (13, 6) (13, 29) (13, 0) (19, 20) (19, 6) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 20) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 18) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 29) (11, 15) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 23) (23, 21) (23, 5) (23, 10) (23, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (24, 25) (24, 16) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 29) (18, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 27) (9, 28) (9, 10) (4, 14) (29, 21) (29, 13) (29, 11) (29, 18) (7, 1) (7, 27) (7, 28) (7, 14) (3, 2) (3, 18) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 9: (9, 12, 28)
- From node 11: (11, 14, 15)
- From node 18: (18, 3, 23)
- From node 21: (21, 0, 23)

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars is [4].
