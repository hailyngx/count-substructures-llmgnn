Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<4, (7, 5, 2)>
<7, (4, 8, 1)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
<5, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 5, 1)>
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, x)>
<0, (6, 9, x)>

Since there are 10 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
