Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. 
Since each central node has 3 leaves, let's count how many edges are incident to each node to determine which are the central nodes:
- Node 0: 6 edges
- Node 1: 4 edges
- Node 2: 4 edges
- Node 3: 3 edges
- Node 4: 4 edges
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 4 edges
- Node 7: 5 edges
- Node 8: 3 edges
- Node 9: 4 edges

Next, create the list of 3-stars based on the central nodes with 3 leaves as follows:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found: [7]
