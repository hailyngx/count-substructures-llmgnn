Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (10, 15) (10, 19) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 0) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 0) (13, 15) (18, 14) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 16) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 7) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 11) (7, 8) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (12, 1) (12, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all unique 3-stars. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (0, 1, 17)>
<3, (1, 9, 17)>
<4, (0, 8, 11)>
<5, (2, 14, 16)>
<6, (7, 14, 15)>
<7, (6, 8, 14)>
<8, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<10, (15, 19, 10)>
<11, (4, 14, 18)>
<12, (1, 17, 12)>
<13, (0, 15, 13)>
<14, (5, 6, 11)>
<15, (13, 15, 19)>
<16, (5, 16, 19)>
<17, (2, 3, 12)>
<18, (11, 14, 18)>
<19, (10, 15, 16)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
