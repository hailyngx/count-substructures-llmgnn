Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be the center of a 3-star.

The nodes with degree 3 in the given graph are:  
Node 6 with neighbors 1, 7, and 3  
Node 4 with neighbors 7, 13, and 10  
Node 7 with neighbors 6, 4, and 0  
Node 10 with neighbors 4, 11, and 8  
Node 13 with neighbors 4, 3, and 0  
Node 12 with neighbors 6, 10, and 5  

Next, we will construct the 3-stars based on the above nodes and their neighbors:

1. <6, (1, 7, 3)>
2. <4, (7, 13, 10)>
3. <7, (6, 4, 0)>
4. <10, (4, 11, 8)>
5. <13, (4, 3, 0)>
6. <12, (6, 10, 5)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [6].
