Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 10) (1, 14) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes adjacent to each node:

Node 0: (6, 10, 2, 14, 8, 13)
Node 1: (10, 14)
Node 2: (5, 4, 0, 3)
Node 3: (4, 7, 10, 2)
Node 4: (5, 10, 3, 2)
Node 5: (2, 8, 12, 4)
Node 6: (9, 7, 10, 11, 0)
Node 7: (3, 6, 8)
Node 8: (5, 7, 0, 14)
Node 9: (6, 11, 13, 12)
Node 10: (4, 6, 0, 3, 1)
Node 11: (9, 6, 12)
Node 12: (5, 9, 11, 13)
Node 13: (9, 0, 14, 12)
Node 14: (0, 8, 1, 13)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

[<0, (6, 10, 2)>, <0, (6, 10, 14)>, <0, (6, 2, 8)>, <0, (10, 14, 0)>, <2, (5, 4, 3)>, <10, (4, 6, 0)>, <10, (4, 6, 3)>, <10, (6, 0, 14)>, <10, (6, 3, 0)>, <6, (9, 11, 12)>, <14, (1, 8, 13)>, <14, (1, 13, 0)>, <14, (8, 13, 0)>, <8, (5, 7, 0)>, <12, (5, 9, 13)>]
