Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 3) (13, 1) (22, 16) (22, 0) (3, 13) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 20) (15, 3) (0, 22) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 6) (27, 8) (7, 6) (7, 23) (21, 5) (21, 17) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 25) (14, 0) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 9) (17, 21) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 1) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 20) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 2) (28, 20) (18, 23) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 25) (16, 22) (16, 28) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 24) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 1) (4, 12) (4, 6) (25, 0) (25, 23) (25, 18) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 29) (10, 3) (10, 26) (10, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 19) (29, 27) (29, 11) (29, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 28) (9, 14) (9, 2) (6, 27) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 29) (2, 28) (2, 9) (5, 21) (5, 18) (5, 24) 

Response:
First, we need to find all nodes connected to exactly three nodes. These nodes will be the centers of our 3-stars. 
Let's list them:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 22, 27, and 14
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 12, and 19
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 13, 15, and 10
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 27, 7, and 4
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 27, 19, and 24
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 29
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 22, 28, and 16
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 23, 26, and 5
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 3, 26, and 28
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 0, 23, and 18

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. 

[10]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (22, 27, 14)>
<1, (13, 12, 19)>
<3, (13, 15, 10)>
<6, (27, 7, 4)>
<8, (27, 19, 24)>
<11, (14, 17, 29)>
<16, (22, 28, 16)>
<18, (23, 26, 5)>
<20, (3, 26, 28)>
<25, (0, 23, 18)>
