Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 18) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 14) (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 7) (3, 25) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 16) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 21) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 4) (26, 17) (4, 27) (4, 26) (16, 25) (16, 12) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 1) (14, 27) (14, 24) (6, 24) (6, 22) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 1) (24, 2) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 22) (19, 13) (19, 23) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 21) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 23) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 24) (2, 7) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 18) (20, 22) (21, 12) (21, 11) (21, 23) (29, 5) (23, 19) (23, 10) (23, 21) (23, 17) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 23) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 10) (1, 0) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 20) (18, 15) (18, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by finding all such cases:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 8. Thus, <5, (9, 2, 8)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 20, and 7. Thus, <9, (5, 20, 7)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 26 is connected to nodes 13, 4, and 17. Thus, <26, (13, 4, 17)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 16 is connected to nodes 25, 12, and 28. Thus, <16, (25, 12, 28)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 28 is connected to nodes 16, 8, and 0. Thus, <28, (16, 8, 0)> is a 3-star.
6. Node 24 is connected to nodes 14, 6, and 17. Thus, <24, (14, 6, 17)> is a 3-star.
7. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 7. Thus, <2, (5, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.
8. Node 0 is connected to nodes 28, 8, and 11. Thus, <0, (28, 8, 11)> is a 3-star.
  
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
