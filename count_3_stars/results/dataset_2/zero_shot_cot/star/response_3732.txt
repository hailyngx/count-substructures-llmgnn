Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [9]
