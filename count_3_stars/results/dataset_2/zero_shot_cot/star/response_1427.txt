Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the nodes that act as center nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (4, 1, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<2, (9, 5, 1)>
<3, (8, 7, 5)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 3, 2)>
<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<8, (6, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
