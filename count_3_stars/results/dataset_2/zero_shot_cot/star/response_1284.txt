Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by looking at nodes which have exactly 3 incident edges. Let's identify the 3-star structures:

<0, (8, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 13, 11)>
<2, (5, 13, 7)>
<4, (12, 0, 3)>
<6, (5, 10, 12)>
<9, (5, 8, 14)>
<10, (5, 6, 4)>
<11, (13, 0, 14)>
<14, (9, 11, 3)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph, therefore the final answer is [9].
