Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 3) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 6, forming a 3-star with node 0 as the center. <0, (11, 13, 6)>

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 8, forming a 3-star with node 1 as the center. <1, (9, 12, 8)>

Continuing through the remaining nodes, we find:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 10, forming a 3-star with node 2 as the center. <2, (9, 6, 10)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 10, forming a 3-star with node 3 as the center. <3, (4, 12, 10)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 7, forming a 3-star with node 5 as the center. <5, (9, 12, 7)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 1, forming a 3-star with node 8 as the center. <8, (7, 11, 1)>
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 6, forming a 3-star with node 14 as the center. <14, (9, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
