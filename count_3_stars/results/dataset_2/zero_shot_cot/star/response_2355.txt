Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (14, 1) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 16) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 9) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (7, 3) (7, 18) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (13, 14, 16)>
<2, (0, 8, 12)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 6, 10)>
<6, (3, 5, 11)>
<8, (2, 9, 16)>
<9, (8, 17, 19)>
<10, (5, 15, 17)>
<11, (5, 6, 13)>
<12, (2, 15, 16)>
<13, (1, 11, 19)>
<14, (1, 15, 16)>
<15, (1, 10, 12)>
<16, (1, 8, 19)>
<17, (9, 10, 16)>
<18, (0, 4, 7)>
<19, (9, 13, 16)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find: [16].
