Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 17) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 14) (18, 15) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 19) (17, 11) (17, 9) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 19) (0, 1) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 10: (7, 12, 5)
- Node 8: (11, 13, 14)
- Node 1: (3, 2, 13)
- Node 13: (7, 1, 10, 8, 12)
- Node 15: (6, 18, 14, 8)

Next, we'll check each potential center and identify the 3-stars around them.

For Node 10:
- <10, (7, 5, 12)>

For Node 8:
- <8, (11, 13, 14)>
- <8, (13, 14, 15)>

For Node 1:
- <1, (3, 2, 13)>

For Node 13:
- <13, (7, 1, 8)>
- <13, (1, 8, 12)>
- <13, (7, 10, 12)>

For Node 15:
- <15, (6, 18, 8)>
- <15, (6, 14, 8)>
- <15, (8, 14, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
