Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form triangles in this graph. Nodes that are connected by edges form triangles. 

Triangles: 
- (4, 7, 0)
- (4, 6, 0)
- (4, 2, 8)
- (7, 9, 1)
- (6, 3, 0)
- (5, 7, 8)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The possible 3-star combinations are: 
<4, (7, 6, 2)> 
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
<6, (4, 9, 8)>
<9, (7, 6, 1)>
<8, (6, 2, 5)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<0, (7, 6, 3)>
<1, (9, 8, 0)>
<3, (6, 0, 5)>
<5, (7, 8, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
