Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (15, 14) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 6) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 1) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 7) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 6) (12, 4) (12, 13) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 9) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 11) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 13) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 1) (19, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Looking at the provided edge list, we can identify the following nodes and their connections:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 16
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 14, and 18
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 4, 5, and 17
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 6, 9, and 7

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 16)>
<1, (5, 14, 18)>
<13, (4, 5, 17)>
<18, (6, 9, 7)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [4].
