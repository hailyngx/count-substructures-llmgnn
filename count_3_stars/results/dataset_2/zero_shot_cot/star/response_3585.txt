Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 19) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 18) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 4) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 7) (17, 3) (17, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 11) (19, 0) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 0) (8, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (4, 16) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them step by step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5: (9, 15, 16)
- Node 9: (5, 7, 12)
- Node 1: (3, 11, 16)
- Node 3: (0, 1, 17)
- Node 0: (3, 8, 19)
- Node 13: (3, 7, 17)
- Node 18: (10, 14, 15, 11)
- Node 16: (1, 5, 13, 4)
- Node 4: (2, 15, 16)
- Node 11: (1, 8, 18, 2)
- Node 2: (6, 19, 11, 4)
- Node 12: (9, 14)
- Node 7: (5, 9, 13)
- Node 8: (0, 11)
- Node 6: (2)

2. Unique 3-stars formed in the graph:
- <5, (9, 15, 16)>
- <9, (5, 7, 12)>
- <1, (3, 11, 16)>
- <3, (0, 1, 17)>
- <0, (3, 8, 19)>
- <13, (3, 7, 17)>
- <18, (10, 14, 15)>
- <16, (1, 5, 13)>
- <4, (2, 15, 16)>
- <11, (1, 8, 18)>
- <2, (6, 19, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
