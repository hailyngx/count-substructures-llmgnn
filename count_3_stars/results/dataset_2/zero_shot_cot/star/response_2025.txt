Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (16, 12) (16, 29) (5, 21) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 20) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 28) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 22) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 1) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 0) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 19) (21, 5) (21, 28) (21, 23) (28, 4) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 19) (15, 10) (15, 20) (20, 9) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 27) (0, 26) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 29) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 22) (25, 9) (22, 7) (22, 17) (23, 26) (23, 21) (8, 18) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 12) (19, 28) (19, 14) (19, 24) (29, 16) (29, 26) (29, 14) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 27) (24, 17) (24, 19) (27, 1) (27, 20) (27, 13) 

Response:
First, we can identify the 3-star structures in the graph. 

1. Nodes connected to other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 17, 26.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 18.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 10, 11.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 13, 16, 17, 28.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 21.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 9, 18.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 17, 22.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 18, 28.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 20, 25.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 15.
   - Node 11 is connected to nodes 3.
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 16, 19.
   - Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 20, 27.
   - Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 19, 26, 29.
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 20.
   - Node 16 is connected to nodes 12, 29.
   - Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, 22, 24.
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8.
   - Node 19 is connected to nodes 12, 14, 24, 28.
   - Node 20 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 15, 27.
   - Node 21 is connected to nodes 5, 23, 28.
   - Node 22 is connected to nodes 7, 17.
   - Node 23 is connected to nodes 21, 26.
   - Node 24 is connected to nodes 17, 19.
   - Node 25 is connected to nodes 9.
   - Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, 14, 23, 29.
   - Node 27 is connected to nodes 1, 13, 20.
   - Node 28 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 19, 21.
   - Node 29 is connected to nodes 14, 16, 26.

After identifying the connections, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

<1, (6, 10, 17)>
<1, (26, 27, 6)>
<1, (17, 4, 7)>
<4, (7, 12, 16)>
<6, (2, 6, 18)>
<9, (6, 9, 20)>
<12, (12, 4, 7)>
<14, (26, 29, 14)>
