Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 3) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 9) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 15) (8, 1) (23, 3) (23, 13) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 10) (6, 24) (6, 12) (6, 19) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 24) (26, 21) (26, 16) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 15) (24, 18) (24, 6) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 12) (19, 0) (19, 22) (19, 6) (19, 25) (10, 28) (10, 14) (10, 20) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 2) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 17) (7, 14) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 16) (5, 11) (5, 2) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 2) (29, 4) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 10) (15, 22) (15, 9) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 24) (12, 13) (12, 14) (13, 23) (13, 12) (4, 29) (4, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected in the pattern of a 3-star, where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through each node and its connections to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 27, 11, and 19. So, the 3-star is <0, (27, 11, 19)>.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 20, and 25. So, the 3-star is <1, (3, 20, 25)>.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 27, 1, and 9. So, the 3-star is <3, (27, 1, 9)>.
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 11. So, the 3-star is <9, (1, 3, 11)>.
5. Node 12 is connected to nodes 28, 6, and 24. So, the 3-star is <12, (28, 6, 24)>.
6. Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 4. So, the 3-star is <14, (10, 7, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
