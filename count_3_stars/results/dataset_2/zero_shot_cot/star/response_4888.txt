Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 1) (11, 18) (11, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 9) (5, 13) (5, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 1) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 14) (9, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 7) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 0) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected by exactly three edges (leaves of the stars). Since each 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves, we need to find nodes that have a degree of 3 in the graph.

Here are the nodes with a degree of 3:
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 11
- Node 12
- Node 13
- Node 14
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 17
- Node 19

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their neighbors.

By examining the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars:
- <2, (8, 12, 15)>
- <4, (11, 12, 14)>
- <5, (13, 14, 16)>
- <6, (13, 17, 7)>
- <7, (6, 9, 3)>
- <9, (18, 3, 7)>
- <10, (1, 19, 14)>
- <11, (18, 4, 1)>
- <12, (2, 4, 19)>
- <13, (5, 17, 16)>
- <14, (5, 1, 16)>
- <15, (8, 2, 0)>
- <16, (13, 14, 0)>
- <17, (13, 3, 6)>
- <19, (18, 12, 1)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: 15

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
<2, (8, 12, 15)>, <4, (11, 12, 14)>, <5, (13, 14, 16)>, <6, (13, 17, 7)>, <7, (6, 9, 3)>, <9, (18, 3, 7)>, <10, (1, 19, 14)>, <11, (18, 4, 1)>, <12, (2, 4, 19)>, <13, (5, 17, 16)>, <14, (5, 1, 16)>, <15, (8, 2, 0)>, <16, (13, 14, 0)>, <17, (13, 3, 6)>, <19, (18, 12, 1)>
