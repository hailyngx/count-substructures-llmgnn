Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 18) (13, 5) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 0) (19, 1) (19, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 9) (7, 15) (7, 10) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 3, 16), (1, 3, 14), (1, 3, 19)
2. Node 3: (3, 1, 11)
3. Node 4: (4, 3, 12), (4, 3, 14)
4. Node 5: (5, 11, 13), (5, 11, 17), (5, 13, 17)
5. Node 6: (6, 8, 18), (6, 8, 17), (6, 10, 18), (6, 10, 17)
6. Node 7: (7, 15, 10)
7. Node 8: (8, 6, 16), (8, 6, 17), (8, 6, 10)
8. Node 9: (9, 0, 3), (9, 0, 17), (9, 3, 17)
9. Node 10: (10, 6, 12), (10, 6, 7)
10. Node 11: (11, 3, 18), (11, 5, 13)
11. Node 12: (12, 4, 14)

Therefore, there are a total of [21] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 16, 14)>
<3, (1, 11, 18)>
<4, (3, 12, 14)>
<5, (11, 13, 17)>
<6, (8, 18, 17)>
<7, (15, 10, 7)>
<8, (6, 16, 17)>
<9, (0, 3, 17)>
<10, (6, 12, 7)>
<12, (4, 14, 12)>
