Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be the central node of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three leaves, any node with a degree of 3 can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with degree 3: 1, 3, 13, 5, 6, 2, 0, 7, 11, 9, 10, 4, 14

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (13, 8, 9)>
<3, (10, 2, 5)>
<5, (13, 6, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 0)>
<2, (3, 8, 6)>
<0, (13, 6, 12)>
<7, (8, 6, 11)>
<11, (8, 7, 4)>
<9, (1, 8, 7)>
<10, (3, 5, 12)>
<4, (5, 2, 11)>
<14, (2, 10, 10)>

Since each <central node, (leaf 1, leaf 2, leaf 3)> indicates a unique 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
