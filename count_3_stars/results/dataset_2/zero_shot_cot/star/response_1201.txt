Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 11) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify all possible 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (9, 7, 13)>
<3, (5, 7, 14)>
<4, (9, 7, 14)>
<5, (3, 7, 10)>
<6, (7, 8, 11)>
<7, (5, 9, 10)>
<8, (6, 13, 2)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<10, (0, 5, 10)>
<11, (0, 6, 14)>
<12, (3, 9, 10)>
<13, (1, 8, 2)>
<14, (3, 4, 11)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[13]
