Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the central node of each 3-star. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

By examining the edges provided, we can identify the nodes with three neighbors: nodes 5, 8, and 0 each have 3 neighbors. 

Next, let's find the leaves connected to each central node. </>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>

By listing all the unique 3-stars found, we can see that there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
