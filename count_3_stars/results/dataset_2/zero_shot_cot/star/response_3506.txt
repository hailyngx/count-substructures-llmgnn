Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 0) (16, 15) (16, 2) (15, 16) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 7) (2, 16) (2, 20) (2, 3) (29, 28) (29, 19) (3, 2) (3, 25) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 24) (20, 2) (20, 14) (5, 24) (6, 15) (6, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 9) (26, 19) (26, 22) (26, 17) (28, 11) (28, 29) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 23) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 23) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 12) (0, 11) (0, 28) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (10, 6) (10, 22) (21, 18) (8, 28) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 12) (24, 11) (24, 25) (24, 5) (17, 26) (17, 12) (17, 23) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 13) (7, 15) (7, 27) (7, 18) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 27, 23, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 16, 20, and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 25, and 4.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 15, 2, and another node not forming a 3-star.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 15, 27, and 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 1, and 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 21.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 26, 10, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 19, and 12.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 23.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
- There are <15, (27, 23, 7)> and <2, (16, 20, 3)>.
- There are no other unique 3-stars present in the given graph.

[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 2.]
