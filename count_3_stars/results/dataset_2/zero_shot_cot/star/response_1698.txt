Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to the same central node by exactly three edges. These nodes together with the central node form a 3-star.
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the given edges:

The central node is connected to 1, 2, 4, and 5.
By checking the connections for nodes 1, 2, 4, and 5, we can list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 9, 2)>
<4, (9, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 1)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (3, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [6].
