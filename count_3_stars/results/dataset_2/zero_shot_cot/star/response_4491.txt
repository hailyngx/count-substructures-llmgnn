Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Starting from node 0: (0, 6, 4, 8), (0, 6, 7, 4)
2. Moving to node 1: (1, 6, 3, 0), (1, 6, 2, 8)
3. Proceeding to node 2: (2, 5, 1, 3), (2, 5, 6, 4)
4. Going to node 3: (3, 6, 1, 8), (3, 6, 7, 4)
5. Switching to node 4: (4, 6, 3, 0), (4, 6, 2, 8)
6. Going to node 5: (5, 9, 1, 8), (5, 9, 7, 3)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8. 
So the final answer is [8]. 
Unique 3-stars found: <0, (6, 4, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 4)>, <1, (6, 3, 0)>, <1, (6, 2, 8)>, <2, (5, 1, 3)>, <2, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 4)>
