Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-star graphs. The nodes with degree 3 are: 6, 9, 10, 11, 8, 13, 5, 7, 12, 0, 4, 3, 1, and 2.

Next, let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:
<6, (9, 5, 8)>
<9, (6, 11, 7)>
<10, (11, 8, -)>
<11, (9, 10, 12)>
<8, (6, 10, 13)>
<13, (6, 8, 12)>
<5, (6, 12, 0)>
<7, (9, 8, 3)>
<12, (5, 13, 4)>
<0, (5, 7, 11)>
<4, (13, 12, 14)>
<3, (9, 8, 7)>
<1, (11, 7, 2)>
<2, (11, 13, 14)>

So there are 14 unique 3-stars in the graph. The final answer is [14].
