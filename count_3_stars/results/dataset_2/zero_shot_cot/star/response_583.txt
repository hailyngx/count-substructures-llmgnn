Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the center nodes in the graph. To be a center node of a 3-star, a node must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Here are the nodes which satisfy this condition: 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, 8, 0. 

Next, let's identify the leaves for each center node listed above. We'll only consider nodes that are connected to the center node and are not directly connected to each other. Now, let's list the 3-star configurations we find:

<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)>
<1, (7, 2, 0)>
<3, (6, 7, 0)>
<2, (1, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 1, 2)>
<0, (9, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are [10] total 3-stars in this graph.
