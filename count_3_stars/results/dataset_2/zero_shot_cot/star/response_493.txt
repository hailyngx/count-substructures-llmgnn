Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central node and its connections. 
From the given edges, we can determine the following:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 2, and 3.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 2, 1, and 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 2, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 3, and 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 1, 3, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6 and 2.
- Node 0 is connected to node 6.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. From node 9: <9, (6, 8, 2)>.
2. From node 4: <4, (7, 8, 2)>.
3. From node 7: <7, (4, 3, 1)>.
4. From node 1: <1, (4, 7, 3)>.
5. From node 3: <3, (9, 7, 1)>.
6. From node 6: <6, (5, 9, 4)>.
7. From node 8: <8, (9, 4, 1)>.
8. From node 2: <2, (5, 9, 4)>.

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
