Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 1) (11, 5) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (10, 12) (10, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Central node: Check which nodes have exactly 3 edges connected to them.
2. Connected nodes: For each central node, find the nodes connected to it.

Let's start the process:

Central Node: 
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 4, and 14.

Connected Nodes:
<8, (13, 4, 14)>
<13, (8, 5, 3)>
<4, (8, 9, 6)>
<3, (13, 14, 5)>
<5, (13, 3, 11)>
<1, (11, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 1, 7)>
<0, (8, 6, 12)>
<12, (5, 6, 0)>
<7, (8, 5, 1)>
<9, (13, 4, 1)>

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<8, (13, 4, 14)>
<13, (8, 5, 3)>
<4, (8, 9, 6)>
<3, (13, 14, 5)>
<5, (13, 3, 11)>
<1, (11, 6, 9)>
<6, (4, 1, 7)>
<0, (8, 6, 12)>
<12, (5, 6, 0)>
<7, (8, 5, 1)>
<9, (13, 4, 1)>

Count: [11]
