Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 29) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (4, 23) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 22) (12, 27) (12, 0) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 10) (27, 11) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 3) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 13) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 11) (20, 15) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 22) (28, 0) (28, 14) (17, 9) (17, 8) (29, 5) (29, 19) (29, 21) (3, 2) (3, 20) (3, 21) (3, 26) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 24) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 25) (11, 27) (11, 18) (11, 15) (23, 4) (22, 7) (22, 27) (22, 2) (22, 20) (22, 16) (26, 3) (26, 16) (26, 8) (8, 20) (8, 17) (8, 26) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 14) (16, 10) (24, 21) (24, 16) (24, 10) (0, 12) (0, 15) (0, 28) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 28) (14, 16) (25, 2) (25, 1) (19, 7) (19, 29) (13, 18) (10, 27) (10, 16) (10, 24) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars based on this definition.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 15
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 22, 25
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 20, 26
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 23, 1, 1
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 7
6. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 19, 14
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 20, 17, 26
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 17, 1
9. Node 10 is connected to nodes 27, 16, 24
10. Node 11 is connected to nodes 27, 18, 15
11. Node 12 is connected to nodes 27, 0, 0
12. Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 28
13. Node 15 is connected to nodes 20, 11, 0
14. Node 16 is connected to nodes 22, 26, 24
15. Node 17 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 8
16. Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 11, 13
17. Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 29, 29
18. Node 20 is connected to nodes 15, 3, 8
19. Node 21 is connected to nodes 29, 3, 24
20. Node 22 is connected to nodes 27, 2, 20
21. Node 24 is connected to nodes 21, 16, 10
22. Node 25 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 1
23. Node 26 is connected to nodes 3, 16, 8
24. Node 27 is connected to nodes 12, 22, 10
25. Node 28 is connected to nodes 0, 14, 14
26. Node 29 is connected to nodes 5, 19, 21

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
1. <1, (9, 4, 15)>
2. <2, (18, 22, 25)>
3. <3, (2, 20, 26)>
4. <6, (9, 14, 7)>
5. <7, (6, 19, 14)>
6. <8, (20, 17, 26)>
7. <9, (6, 17, 1)>
8. <10, (27, 16, 24)>
9. <11, (27, 18, 15)>
10. <12, (27, 0, 0)>
11. <14, (6, 7, 28)>
12. <16, (22, 26, 24)>
13. <17, (9, 8, 8)>
14. <18, (2, 11, 13)>
15. <19, (7, 29, 29)>
16. <20, (15, 3, 8)>
17. <21, (29, 3, 24)>
18. <24, (21, 16, 10)>

Therefore, there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
