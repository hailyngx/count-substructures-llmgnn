Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 9) (21, 19) (21, 15) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 24) (17, 12) (3, 19) (3, 8) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 6) (25, 12) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 16) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 29) (12, 17) (12, 25) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 9) (5, 14) (5, 11) (6, 25) (6, 16) (15, 21) (15, 7) (19, 21) (19, 3) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 0) (4, 14) (4, 27) (4, 9) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 15) (7, 24) (18, 20) (18, 28) (18, 29) (16, 20) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 28) (16, 22) (28, 18) (28, 16) (2, 27) (2, 11) (9, 1) (9, 27) (9, 4) (9, 10) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 0) (29, 8) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 18) (29, 10) (0, 26) (0, 22) (0, 24) (24, 17) (24, 7) (24, 0) (10, 9) (10, 22) (10, 29) (23, 1) (23, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (7, 23, 9)>
<9, (1, 27, 4)>
<27, (12, 4, 2)>
<4, (14, 27, 9)>
<7, (1, 25, 15)>
<15, (21, 7, 25)>
<21, (19, 15, 1)>
<19, (21, 3, 26)>
<3, (19, 8, 3)>
<25, (7, 6, 20)>
<20, (25, 18, 16)>
<8, (3, 13, 29)>
<13, (8, 12, 16)>
<12, (17, 25, 27)>
<27, (12, 2, 9)>
<5, (14, 11, 5)>
<6, (25, 16, 6)>
<16, (20, 13, 6)>
<14, (4, 5, 14)>
<18, (20, 28, 29)>
<28, (18, 16, 28)>
<2, (27, 11, 2)>
<10, (9, 22, 29)>
<22, (16, 10, 0)>
<0, (26, 22, 24)>
<26, (19, 29, 0)>
<29, (8, 13, 26)>
<24, (17, 7, 0)>
<11, (5, 2, 11)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars we found, we get 28 in total. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
