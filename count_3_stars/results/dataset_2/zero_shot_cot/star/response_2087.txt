Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 18) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (5, 15) (5, 10) (19, 0) (19, 9) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 16) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (16, 1) (16, 6) (14, 9) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 13) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 7) (11, 18) (11, 9) (11, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node to determine the 3-stars. 

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 16, and 12.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8 and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 9.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 15, and 11.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 17.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 15 and 10.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 19, 11, 14, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 16.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 19, 9, 10, 12, and 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 0, and 13.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1 and 6.
- Node 14 is connected to node 9.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 11, and 15.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 18, 17, and 13.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 0, 10, and 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 18, 9, and 12.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 18, 5, and 12.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 16, 12)>
<3, (1, 18, 4)>
<4, (8, 18, 11)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<18, (3, 4, 15)>
<2, (8, 13, 17)>
<5, (15, 10, 0)>
<19, (9, 0, 0)>
<9, (8, 19, 11)>
<6, (1, 16, 1)>
<0, (19, 10, 13)>
<10, (5, 0, 13)>
<17, (2, 7, 7)>
<16, (1, 6, 1)>
<14, (9, 9, 9)>
<12, (1, 11, 15)>
<7, (18, 17, 13)>
<13, (2, 10, 7)>
<11, (18, 9, 12)>
<15, (18, 5, 12)>

Counting the number of 3-stars we found, we get a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
