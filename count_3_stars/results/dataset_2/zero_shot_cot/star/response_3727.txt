Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step and identify all 3-stars:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 12, 10, and 7. This forms a 3-star <5, (9, 13, 12)>.
2. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 13. This forms a 3-star <6, (9, 12, 13)>.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 0. This forms a 3-star <4, (9, 7, 0)>.
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 3, and 10. This forms a 3-star <7, (5, 9, 4)>.
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 12. This forms a 3-star <8, (13, 11, 12)>.
6. Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 1, and 2. This forms a 3-star <10, (5, 7, 1)>.
7. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 0, and 12. This forms a 3-star <3, (4, 7, 0)>.
8. Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 10, 0, and 14. This forms a 3-star <1, (13, 10, 0)>.
9. Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 0. This forms a 3-star <2, (10, 11, 0)>.

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
