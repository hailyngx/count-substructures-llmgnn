Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. We need to identify all nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, we need to check if they form a 3-star configuration.
3. Finally, we count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Let's go step by step:

Nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 4, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 0.

3-stars:
- For node 9: <9, (8, 4, 3)>.
- For node 8: <8, (9, 6, 4)>.
- For node 6: <6, (7, 3, 0)>.

So the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <9, (8, 4, 3)>, <8, (9, 6, 4)>, and <6, (7, 3, 0)>.
