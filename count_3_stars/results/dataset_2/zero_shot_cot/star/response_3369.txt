Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 5: <5, (1, 3, 6)> 
2. From node 9: <9, (4, 7, 5)> 
3. From node 1: <1, (5, 3, 6)> 
4. From node 3: <3, (1, 5, 4)> 
5. From node 6: <6, (2, 1, 5)> 
6. From node 2: <2, (3, 6, 8)> 
7. From node 8: <8, (1, 3, 2)> 
8. From node 7: <7, (9, 4, 2)> 
9. From node 4: <4, (9, 1, 3)> 

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
