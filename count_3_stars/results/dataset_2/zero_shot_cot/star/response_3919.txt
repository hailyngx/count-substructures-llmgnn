Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 9) (16, 21) (16, 29) (16, 18) (28, 4) (28, 18) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 25) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 7) (13, 6) (20, 29) (20, 24) (29, 16) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 0) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 21) (2, 6) (2, 24) (22, 6) (22, 25) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 24) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 4) (25, 18) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 27) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (7, 13) (14, 23) (14, 15) (12, 1) (12, 6) (0, 29) (0, 19) (0, 9) (0, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 3) (27, 10) (18, 16) (18, 28) (18, 25) (18, 10) (18, 0) (4, 28) (4, 1) (4, 23) (4, 25) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 21) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 3) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 1 has edges to nodes 4, 12, and 17.
- Node 16 has edges to nodes 18, 21, and 29.
- Node 23 has edges to nodes 3, 11, and 14.
- Node 25 has edges to nodes 4, 17, and 22.
- Node 6 has edges to nodes 2, 12, and 22.
- Node 13 has edges to nodes 6, 7, and 21.
- Node 10 has edges to nodes 18, 26, and 27.
- Node 15 has edges to nodes 8, 14, and 19.
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 3, 8, and 15.
- Node 19 has edges to nodes 0, 9, and 15.
- Node 0 has edges to nodes 9, 18, and 29.
- Node 9 has edges to nodes 0, 3, and 19.

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 12, 17)>
<16, (18, 21, 29)>
<23, (3, 11, 14)>
<25, (4, 17, 22)>
<6, (2, 12, 22)>
<13, (6, 7, 21)>
<10, (18, 26, 27)>
<15, (8, 14, 19)>
<8, (3, 8, 15)>
<19, (0, 9, 15)>
<0, (9, 18, 29)>
<9, (0, 3, 19)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars listed: [12]
