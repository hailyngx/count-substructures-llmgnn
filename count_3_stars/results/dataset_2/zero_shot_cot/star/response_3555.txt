Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 12) (10, 18) (10, 13) (12, 6) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (2, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 18) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs. 

Looking for nodes with degree 3, we find:
- Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 4, 6
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 6, 17
- Node 18 has neighbors: 8, 10, 12
- Node 16 has neighbors: 9, 11, 17
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 5, 12
- Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 7, 12
- Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 17, 19
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 3, 16
- Node 14 has neighbors: 5, 15, 18
- Node 13 has neighbors: 0, 4, 10

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
There are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [9]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 17)>
<18, (8, 10, 12)>
<16, (9, 11, 17)>
<6, (3, 5, 12)>
<1, (5, 7, 12)>
<7, (1, 17, 19)>
<9, (2, 3, 16)>
<14, (5, 15, 18)>
