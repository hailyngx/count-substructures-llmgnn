Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 11) (15, 16) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 1) (10, 7) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 16) (17, 9) (17, 16) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, we can count the degrees of each node:
Node 0: 2 edges
Node 1: 3 edges
Node 2: 5 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 6: 2 edges
Node 7: 4 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 9: 3 edges
Node 10: 2 edges
Node 11: 3 edges
Node 12: 2 edges
Node 13: 4 edges
Node 14: 5 edges
Node 15: 2 edges
Node 16: 4 edges
Node 17: 2 edges
Node 18: 3 edges
Node 19: 3 edges

Now, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

After examining the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (10, 7, 19)>
<3, (0, 5, 13)>
<4, (8, 14, 19)>
<5, (2, 11, 3)>
<7, (10, 2, 11)>
<11, (7, 14, 5)>
<12, (7, 16, 2)>
<14, (1, 4, 11)>
<16, (15, 17, 12)>
<18, (8, 9, 13)>
<19, (1, 4, 13)>

Thus, there are 11 unique 3-stars. [11]
