Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find all the 3-stars:

1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 3), (5, 7) → <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>
2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 3), (9, 0) → <9, (5, 3, 0)>
3. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8) → No 3-stars as the edges are not arranged in a star pattern.
4. Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4) → <1, (6, 3, 2)>
5. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0) → <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>
6. Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0) → <4, (1, 7, 8)>
7. Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8) → <7, (5, 3, 8)>
8. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 7) → <8, (5, 6, 4)>, <8, (5, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <1, (6, 3, 2)>, <3, (5, 9, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (5, 3, 8)>, <8, (5, 6, 4)>, <8, (5, 7, 6)>.
