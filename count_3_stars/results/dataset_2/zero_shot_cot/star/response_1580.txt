Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 19) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 9) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 17) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 6) (4, 12) (1, 16) (1, 2) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 9) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 2) (3, 19) (3, 18) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 16) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the 3-stars. 

1. Identify the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 7, and 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 12, 8, and 15.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 5.

Now, since there are only three unique 3-stars in the graph, we have found all of them. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<11, (16, 7, 0)>
<9, (12, 8, 15)>
<17, (6, 19, 5)>
