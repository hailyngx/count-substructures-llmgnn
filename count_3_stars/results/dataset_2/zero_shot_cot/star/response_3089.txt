Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 5, and 9.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 2, and 8.
3. Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 27.
4. Node 22 is connected to nodes 11, 0, 25.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 19, 24.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 24, 20.
7. Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 10.
8. Node 0 is connected to nodes 22, 15.
9. Node 14 is connected to nodes 8, 27, 13.
10. Node 21 is connected to nodes 28, 8, 29, 17.
11. Node 28 is connected to nodes 21, 16, 2.
12. Node 13 is connected to nodes 14, 17, 24.
13. Node 26 is connected to nodes 23, 29, 16.
14. Node 16 is connected to nodes 28, 26, 7, 20.
15. Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 23.
16. Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 12.
17. Node 29 is connected to nodes 21, 26, 7, 25.
18. Node 17 is connected to nodes 21, 13, 2.
19. Node 7 is connected to nodes 16, 29, 20.
20. Node 24 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 13, 11.
21. Node 23 is connected to nodes 26, 19.
22. Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 22, 24.
23. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 14, 21.
24. Node 20 is connected to nodes 6, 16, 7.
25. Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 15.
26. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 28, 9, 17.
27. Node 15 is connected to nodes 0, 12.
28. Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 27, 25.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
