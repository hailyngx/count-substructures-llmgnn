Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 7) (23, 12) (20, 25) (25, 20) (25, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 28) (17, 10) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 15) (6, 28) (6, 3) (28, 10) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 5) (28, 15) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 27) (14, 7) (9, 13) (9, 8) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (24, 13) (24, 11) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 15) (26, 10) (26, 5) (26, 2) (26, 16) (11, 21) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 29) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 11) (2, 5) (2, 26) (2, 27) (12, 23) (12, 15) (12, 19) (16, 26) (16, 19) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 14) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 16) (19, 27) (15, 8) (15, 28) (15, 5) (15, 12) (29, 25) (29, 8) (29, 11) (29, 3) (27, 14) (27, 2) (27, 19) (3, 6) (3, 29) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<10, (1, 21, 26)>
<10, (1, 21, 28)>
<17, (4, 7, 18)>
<17, (4, 7, 28)>
<17, (4, 7, 14)>
<17, (7, 11, 19)>
<17, (7, 11, 29)>
<17, (7, 14, 18)>
<17, (7, 14, 27)>
<28, (5, 6, 15)>
<28, (5, 15, 12)>
<28, (5, 15, 8)>
<28, (5, 26, 2)>
<28, (5, 26, 16)>
<28, (6, 15, 12)>
<28, (6, 15, 8)>
<28, (18, 14, 27)>
<28, (18, 14, 7)>
<28, (18, 17, 4)>
<28, (18, 17, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.
There are 20 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
