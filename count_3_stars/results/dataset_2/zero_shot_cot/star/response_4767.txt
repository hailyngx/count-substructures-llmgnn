Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

We'll start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

From the provided edges, we can see that nodes 1, 2, and 6 are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now let's count the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 1:
- (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8)
   - <1, (7, 6, 9)>
   - <1, (7, 6, 3)>
   - <1, (7, 6, 5)>
   - <1, (7, 6, 8)>
   - <1, (7, 9, 3)>
   - <1, (7, 9, 5)>
   - <1, (7, 9, 8)>
   - <1, (7, 3, 5)>
   - <1, (7, 3, 8)>
   - <1, (7, 5, 8)>
   - <1, (6, 9, 3)>
   - <1, (6, 9, 5)>
   - <1, (6, 9, 8)>
   - <1, (6, 3, 5)>
   - <1, (6, 3, 8)>
   - <1, (6, 5, 8)>
   - <1, (9, 3, 5)>
   - <1, (9, 3, 8)>
   - <1, (9, 5, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 8)>
   
For node 2:
- (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 0)
   - <2, (6, 9, 3)>
   - <2, (6, 9, 5)>
   - <2, (6, 9, 0)>
   - <2, (6, 3, 5)>
   - <2, (6, 3, 0)>
   - <2, (6, 5, 0)>
   - <2, (9, 3, 5)>
   - <2, (9, 3, 0)>
   - <2, (9, 5, 0)>
   - <2, (3, 5, 0)>
 
For node 6:
- (6, 7), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8)
   - <6, (7, 5, 1)>
   - <6, (7, 5, 2)>
   - <6, (7, 5, 8)>
   - <6, (7, 1, 2)>
   - <6, (7, 1, 8)>
   - <6, (7, 2, 8)>
   - <6, (5, 1, 2)>
   - <6, (5, 1, 8)>
   - <6, (5, 2, 8)>
   - <6, (1, 2, 8)>
  
Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [27] 3-stars in the given graph.
