Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are <5, (1, 3, 7)> and <7, (5, 9, 8)> 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
