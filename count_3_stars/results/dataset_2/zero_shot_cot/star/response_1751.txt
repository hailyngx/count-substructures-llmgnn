Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 11) (9, 27) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 28) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 17) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 26) (25, 17) (25, 8) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 16) (21, 23) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 23) (6, 16) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (8, 25) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 0) (17, 7) (17, 25) (17, 18) (29, 22) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 16) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 1) (26, 3) (26, 23) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 20) (19, 27) (14, 3) (14, 6) (16, 21) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 1) (23, 21) (23, 6) (23, 26) (23, 15) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 28) (28, 9) (28, 4) (28, 15) (28, 22) (24, 10) (24, 20) (1, 13) (1, 16) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 19) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 24) (27, 9) (27, 19) (22, 29) (22, 28) (22, 20) (20, 19) (20, 24) (20, 22) (18, 17) (18, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- <0, (2, 8, 16)>
- <1, (12, 13, 16)>
- <2, (0, 8, 13)>
- <3, (21, 14, 26)>
- <4, (7, 13, 28)>
- <5, (6, 9, 10)>
- <6, (5, 14, 23)>
- <7, (4, 17, 21)>
- <8, (2, 8, 25)>
- <9, (5, 11, 28)>
- <10, (5, 12, 24)>
- <11, (9, 19, 27)>
- <12, (1, 18, 13)>
- <13, (1, 2, 4)>
- <14, (3, 6, 23)>
- <15, (19, 23, 28)>
- <16, (0, 1, 21)>
- <17, (7, 18, 25)>
- <18, (12, 17, 21)>
- <19, (8, 11, 27)>
- <20, (22, 24, 19)>
- <21, (3, 7, 16)>
- <22, (20, 28, 29)>
- <23, (6, 15, 21)>
- <24, (10, 20, 24)>
- <25, (8, 17, 25)>
- <26, (3, 23, 26)>
- <27, (11, 19, 27)>
- <28, (4, 9, 15)>
- <29, (22)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph: [30]
