Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. Go through each node and check if they are connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, then a 3-star is present with that node as the center.

Based on the given edges, we find the following 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 1, 3)>
- <1, (5, 3, 4)>
- <2, (5, 8, 1)>
- <4, (5, 9, 1)>
- <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- <6, (9, 5, 8)>
- <8, (5, 6, 2)>
- <9, (5, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [8].
