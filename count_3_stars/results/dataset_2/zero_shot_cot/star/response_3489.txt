Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 15) (7, 13) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 11) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 16) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 4) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 18) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 11, 10)>
<9, (5, 14, 6)>
<14, (9, 10, 12)>
<17, (8, 2, 4)>
<4, (17, 15, 19)>
<7, (13, 13, 13)>
<6, (14, 18, 11)>
<2, (17, 12, 13)>
<8, (17, 16, 3)>
<3, (11, 10, 16)>
<0, (11, 18, 1)>
<1, (0, 15, 19)>
<15, (4, 1, 15)>
<13, (7, 2, 0)>
<12, (14, 2, 16)>
<16, (8, 3, 12)>
<18, (6, 0, 16)>
<19, (4, 1, 12)>
<10, (5, 14, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have 19 unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
