Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of 3-stars centered at each node and summing them up.

Let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: (0, 6, 4), (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 8) -> Total: 3
- Node 1: (1, 5, 7), (1, 2, 3), (1, 8, 4) -> Total: 3
- Node 2: (2, 9, 7), (2, 1, 4), (2, 4, 7) -> Total: 3
- Node 3: (3, 1, 4), (3, 4, 0) -> Total: 2
- Node 4: (4, 9, 6), (4, 3, 0), (4, 8, 6) -> Total: 3
- Node 5: (5, 6, 7), (5, 1, 7) -> Total: 2
- Node 6: (6, 5, 9), (6, 9, 4), (6, 8, 4), (6, 0, 3) -> Total: 4
- Node 7: (7, 5, 1), (7, 2, 8) -> Total: 2
- Node 8: (8, 6, 1), (8, 4, 6), (8, 7, 2) -> Total: 3
- Node 9: (9, 6, 4), (9, 2, 7) -> Total: 2

Adding up the totals from each node: 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 2)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<3, (1, 4, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 7, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (5, 1, 7)>
<8, (6, 4, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 7)>
