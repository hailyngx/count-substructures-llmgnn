Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3)
