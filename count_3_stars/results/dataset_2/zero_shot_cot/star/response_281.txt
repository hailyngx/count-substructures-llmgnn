Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star configuration.

Given the edges provided, we can find that there are multiple 3-star configurations in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars: 
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<8, (6, 1, 4)>
<0, (6, 9, 3)>
<2, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
