Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 14)>
<6, (9, 7, 11)>
<8, (5, 13, 7)>
<13, (8, 3, 10)>
<3, (5, 13, 12)>
<0, (5, 7, 11)>
<14, (9, 10, 10)>
<7, (6, 8, 13)>
<12, (9, 2, 0)>
<1, (5, 2, 0)>
<10, (6, 13, 14)>
<4, (6, 3, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
