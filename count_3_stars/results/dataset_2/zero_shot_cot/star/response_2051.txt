Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
