Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 0) (25, 24) (0, 25) (0, 1) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 26) (19, 2) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 4) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (22, 28) (22, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 5) (10, 18) (15, 25) (15, 7) (27, 26) (27, 21) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 21) (12, 20) (12, 26) (12, 22) (12, 5) (28, 22) (28, 4) (23, 14) (23, 26) (23, 29) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (6, 14) (6, 7) (21, 8) (21, 27) (21, 4) (29, 11) (29, 23) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) (24, 1) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 24) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are directly connected to the center node. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars.

Nodes directly connected to node 11: 3, 7, 16, 29
Nodes directly connected to node 14: 6, 13, 17, 23
Nodes directly connected to node 17: 2, 14, 24
Nodes directly connected to node 20: 12, 25
Nodes directly connected to node 25: 0, 15, 20, 24
Nodes directly connected to node 2: 8, 17, 19
Nodes directly connected to node 18: 10, 16
Nodes directly connected to node 8: 2, 5, 21, 26
Nodes directly connected to node 19: 2, 4, 5, 26
Nodes directly connected to node 26: 8, 12, 19, 23, 27
Nodes directly connected to node 9: 7, 24
Nodes directly connected to node 22: 12, 28
Nodes directly connected to node 5: 3, 8, 12, 13, 19
Nodes directly connected to node 13: 1, 5, 14
Nodes directly connected to node 3: 5, 11, 16
Nodes directly connected to node 10: 16, 18
Nodes directly connected to node 15: 7, 25
Nodes directly connected to node 27: 21, 26
Nodes directly connected to node 4: 19, 21, 28
Nodes directly connected to node 1: 0, 13, 24
Nodes directly connected to node 0: 1, 25
Nodes directly connected to node 6: 7, 14
Nodes directly connected to node 21: 4, 8, 27
Nodes directly connected to node 29: 11, 23
Nodes directly connected to node 24: 1, 9, 17, 25

Now, let's find all the unique 3-stars in the graph.

<11, (3, 7, 16)>
<14, (6, 13, 17)>
<17, (2, 14, 24)>
<20, (12, 25, 24)>
<25, (0, 15, 20)>
<2, (8, 17, 19)>
<18, (10, 16, None)>
<8, (5, 21, 26)>
<19, (4, 5, 26)>
<26, (12, 19, 23)>
<9, (7, 24, None)>
<22, (12, 28, None)>
<5, (3, 13, 19)>
<13, (1, 5, 14)>
<3, (5, 11, 16)>
<10, (16, 18, None)>
<15, (7, 25, None)>
<27, (21, 26, None)>
<4, (19, 21, 28)>
<1, (0, 13, 24)>
<0, (1, 25, None)>
<6, (7, 14, None)>
<21, (4, 8, 27)>
<29, (11, 23, None)>

Therefore, there are 24 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
