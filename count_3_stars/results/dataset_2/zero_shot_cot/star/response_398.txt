Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 15) (11, 21) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 20) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 27) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 26) (8, 16) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 1) (23, 3) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 24) (15, 22) (15, 20) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 29) (26, 25) (26, 4) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 2) (17, 9) (17, 18) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 14) (14, 22) (14, 29) (14, 2) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 27) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (2, 28) (2, 14) (2, 19) (4, 26) (0, 28) (0, 19) (0, 12) (21, 11) (21, 19) (12, 28) (12, 0) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 1) (5, 27) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 5) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 24) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 5) (1, 10) (24, 13) (24, 23) (24, 19) (24, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

Nodes connected to three other nodes:
1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 23.
2. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 22, and 27.
3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 23.
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 13, and 17.
5. Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 22, and 29.
6. Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 20.
7. Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 21, and 24.
8. Node 22 is connected to nodes 5, 13, and 14.
9. Node 23 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 24.
10. Node 24 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 23.
11. Node 28 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 12.
12. Node 29 is connected to nodes 5, 14, and 20.

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (5, 10, 23)>
<5, (1, 22, 27)>
<8, (1, 10, 23)>
<9, (6, 13, 17)>
<14, (2, 22, 29)>
<16, (6, 7, 20)>
<19, (0, 21, 24)>
<22, (5, 13, 14)>
<23, (1, 3, 24)>
<24, (10, 13, 23)>
<28, (0, 2, 12)>
<29, (5, 14, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
