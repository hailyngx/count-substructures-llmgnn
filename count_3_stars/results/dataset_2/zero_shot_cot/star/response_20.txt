Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (26, 20) (26, 25) (18, 24) (18, 28) (18, 13) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 7) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 16) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 21) (21, 22) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 16) (21, 14) (14, 21) (13, 18) (13, 10) (1, 25) (1, 19) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 17) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 23) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 5) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 3) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 3) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 17) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 27) (5, 12) (2, 27) (24, 18) (24, 12) (19, 1) (19, 23) (25, 26) (25, 1) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 17) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 29) (3, 16) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 19) (17, 22) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges:
- <0, (11, 5, 12)>
- <1, (25, 19, 9)>
- <2, (27, 3, 19)>
- <3, (10, 27, 16)>
- <4, (9, 27, 23)>
- <5, (0, 11, 27)>
- <6, (20, 28, 21)>
- <7, (22, 23, 17)>
- <8, (9, 15, 5)>
- <12, (9, 20, 5)>
- <13, (10, 18, 13)>
- <15, (11, 8, 17)>
- <16, (6, 21, 3)>
- <17, (22, 12, 7)>
- <18, (13, 24, 28)>
- <19, (1, 23, 25)>
- <20, (26, 12, 6)>
- <21, (22, 14, 28)>
- <22, (29, 21, 7)>
- <23, (4, 29, 19)>
- <24, (18, 12, 26)>
- <25, (26, 1, 25)>
- <26, (25, 20, 18)>
- <27, (4, 5, 2)>
- <28, (6, 16, 18)>
- <29, (22, 3, 23)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
