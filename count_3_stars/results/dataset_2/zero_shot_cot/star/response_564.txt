Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 4) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 7) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 22) (20, 26) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 5) (22, 26) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 11) (11, 5) (11, 22) (28, 3) (28, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 2) (7, 27) (7, 28) (7, 0) (10, 18) (2, 22) (2, 0) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 23) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 28) (3, 16) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 24) (16, 13) (24, 16) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 25) (19, 24) (29, 27) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 1) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 13) (23, 1) (23, 17) (23, 13) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 12) (13, 23) (25, 8) (25, 1) (25, 24) (25, 18) (17, 4) (17, 23) (18, 27) (18, 10) (18, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center with exactly three edges, forming 3-stars.

Based on the given edges, the nodes and their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 1
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 1
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 5
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 5
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 29: degree 1

Nodes with degree 3 can potentially be the center of a 3-star, connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the possible 3-stars based on these nodes:
<1, (25, 14, 23)>
<2, (0, 22, 3)>
<5, (11, 12, 6)>
<8, (4, 22, 25)>
<9, (26, 3, 0)>
<11, (5, 22, 11)>
<12, (20, 15, 5)>
<14, (1, 22, 8)>
<15, (13, 27, 20)>
<18, (25, 10, 27)>
<23, (1, 13, 17)>
<24, (16, 25, 13)>
<25, (1, 24, 8)>
<26, (20, 4, 22)>
<28, (7, 3, 27)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
