Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 4) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 17) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 8) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 5) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 4) (10, 13) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 5) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 13)>
<1, (11, 15, 19)>
<2, (6, 12, 15)>
<3, (5, 6, 19)>
<4, (0, 5, 11)>
<5, (3, 4, 15)>
<6, (2, 3, 14)>
<7, (0, 9, 13)>
<9, (1, 7, 18)>
<13, (0, 7, 17)>
<15, (1, 2, 5)>
<17, (13, 17, 18)>
<18, (0, 9, 17)>
<19, (1, 3, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
