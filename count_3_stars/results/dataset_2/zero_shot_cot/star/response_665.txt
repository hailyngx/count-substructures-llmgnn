Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges, forming the leaves of the 3-stars.

From the given edges:
- Node 4 has 5 edges (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 14)
- Node 7 has 3 edges (7, 4), (7, 2), (7, 1)
- Node 8 has 3 edges (8, 4), (8, 11), (8, 12)
- Node 5 has 4 edges (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 10), (5, 14)
- Node 6 has 4 edges (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 10), (6, 0)
- Node 13 has 5 edges (13, 5), (13, 2), (13, 3), (13, 10), (13, 9)
- Node 3 has 5 edges (3, 13), (3, 11), (3, 14), (3, 2), (3, 12)
- Node 11 has 3 edges (11, 8), (11, 3), (11, 12)
- Node 1 has 3 edges (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 9)
- Node 0 has 3 edges (0, 6), (0, 12), (0, 9)

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (6, 13, 10)>
<6, (5, 1, 10)>
<13, (2, 3, 9)>
<3, (11, 14, 12)>
<11, (8, 3, 12)>
<1, (7, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 12, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
