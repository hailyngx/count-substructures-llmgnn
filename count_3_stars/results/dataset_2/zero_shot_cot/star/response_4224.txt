Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 2) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (5, 3) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 13) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 15) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 1) (12, 17) (12, 19) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 10) (18, 16) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 8) (6, 11) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<2, (16, 7, 10)>
<3, (15, 5, 0)>
<4, (11, 15, 1)>
<5, (3, 9, 8)>
<7, (11, 2, 8)>
<8, (5, 0, 7)>
<9, (5, 13, 13)>
<10, (13, 2, 10)>
<11, (16, 13, 6)>
<12, (17, 19, 19)>
<13, (11, 9, 17)>
<14, (15, 19, 14)>
<15, (3, 14, 4)>
<16, (11, 17, 18)>
<17, (16, 13, 12)>
<18, (16, 19, 18)>
<19, (14, 13, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [19].
