Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph.
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can start by checking each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Nodes 4, 7, 6, 9, 1, 3, 5, 2, 8, and 0 all have different numbers of edges connected to them. Let's check each one of them:

- Node 4: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) -> <4, (7, 0, 5)>
- Node 7: (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) -> <7, (4, 3, 9)>
- Node 6: (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) -> <6, (4, 9, 1)>
- Node 9: (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) -> <9, (7, 6, 2)>
- Node 1: (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) -> <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) -> <3, (7, 9, 0)>
- Node 5: (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) -> <5, (4, 2, 0)>
- Node 2: (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) -> <2, (9, 3, 5)>
- Node 8: (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) -> <8, (7, 3, 2)>
- Node 0: (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) -> <0, (4, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: <4, (7, 0, 5)>, <7, (4, 3, 9)>, <6, (4, 9, 1)>, <9, (7, 6, 2)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 0)>, <5, (4, 2, 0)>, <2, (9, 3, 5)>, <8, (7, 3, 2)>, <0, (4, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
