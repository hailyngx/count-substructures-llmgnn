Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present.

First, let's list all nodes that are directly connected to node 1:
- Node 3
- Node 6
- Node 14
- Node 4
- Node 8

Next, let's list all nodes that are directly connected to node 3:
- Node 1
- Node 11
- Node 13
- Node 9
- Node 2
- Node 5

Let's identify the 3-stars based on the information above:
<1, (3, 6, 14)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [2].
