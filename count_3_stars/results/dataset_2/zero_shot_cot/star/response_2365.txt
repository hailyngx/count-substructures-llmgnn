Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges, which could potentially form 3-stars:

Node 0: (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 2)
Node 1: (6, 1), (4, 1), (2, 1)
Node 3: (7, 3), (5, 3), (2, 3)
Node 8: (4, 8), (8, 2), (8, 5)
Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 7), (2, 9)

Next, we need to check if these nodes can form 3-stars. Let's determine which nodes can be the center of a 3-star:

For Node 0: can form 3-star <0, (4, 1, 2)>
For Node 1: can form 3-star <1, (6, 4, 2)>
For Node 3: cannot form a 3-star
For Node 8: can form 3-star <8, (4, 2, 5)>
For Node 9: can form 3-star <9, (2, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have:

<0, (4, 1, 2)>, <1, (6, 4, 2)>, <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
