Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are the central node of a 3-star in the given graph.

From the given edges, we can see that the possible central nodes are: 5, 9, 10, 13, 11, and 0.

Next, let's identify the leaves connected to each central node to check if they form a 3-star.

For node 5:
- Leaves: 13, 3, 10, 14
<5, (13, 3, 10)>
<5, (13, 3, 14)>

For node 9:
- Leaves: 11, 1, 7, 0
<9, (11, 1, 7)>
<9, (11, 1, 0)>

For node 10:
- Leaves: 5, 4, 8, 11, 0, 2
<10, (5, 4, 8)>
<10, (5, 4, 11)>

For node 13:
- Leaves: 5, 2, 11, 3, 14
<13, (5, 2, 11)>
<13, (5, 2, 14)>

For node 11:
- Leaves: 9, 13, 10, 14
<11, (9, 13, 10)>
<11, (9, 13, 14)>

For node 0:
- Leaves: 9, 7, 10, 12, 6
<0, (9, 7, 10)>
<0, (9, 7, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
