Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (3, 5) (3, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the provided edges, we can see the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 6, 14)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 12, 6)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<6, (9, 14, 8)>
<10, (4, 11, 0)>
<10, (11, 14, 13)>
<11, (10, 3, 14)>
<2, (11, 13, 14)>
<14, (5, 6, 12)>
<1, (5, 9, 11)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (9, 11, 0)>
<1, (9, 8, 0)>
<1, (11, 0, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [15].
