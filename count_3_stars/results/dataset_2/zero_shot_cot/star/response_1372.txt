Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves to find the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (4, 8, 14)>
<1, (9, 13, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 10)>
<3, (8, 12, -)>
<4, (9, 12, 14)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<6, (11, 2, 13)>
<7, (9, 2, 1)>
<8, (0, 3, -)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>
<10, (9, 13, 2)>
<11, (5, 7, 6)>
<12, (5, 4, 13)>
<13, (10, 1, 6)>
<14, (4, 0, 12)>

There are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
