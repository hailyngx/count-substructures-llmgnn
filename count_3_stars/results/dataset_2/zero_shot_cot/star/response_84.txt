Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 24) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 2) (1, 13) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18) (18, 22) (18, 3) (18, 5) (18, 24) (8, 22) (8, 23) (8, 9) (23, 4) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 6) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 11) (12, 10) (27, 20) (27, 11) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 20) (28, 16) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 29) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 17) (16, 28) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 25) (15, 23) (15, 10) (15, 2) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 2) (11, 0) (11, 20) (11, 27) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 11) (17, 26) (17, 24) (29, 6) (29, 19) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 10) (24, 7) (24, 18) (24, 0) (24, 9) (24, 17) (5, 18) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we can identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes based on the edges provided. Then, we can look for unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Central nodes with 3 adjacent nodes:
- Central node 13 with adjacent nodes 22, 3, 1
- Central node 22 with adjacent nodes 13, 18, 28
- Central node 4 with adjacent nodes 23, 28, 21
- Central node 18 with adjacent nodes 22, 3, 5
- Central node 8 with adjacent nodes 22, 23, 9
- Central node 23 with adjacent nodes 4, 8, 15
- Central node 20 with adjacent nodes 0, 27, 28
- Central node 26 with adjacent nodes 0, 19, 17
- Central node 28 with adjacent nodes 22, 4, 20
- Central node 19 with adjacent nodes 1, 26, 29
- Central node 10 with adjacent nodes 12, 15, 2
- Central node 15 with adjacent nodes 23, 10, 2
- Central node 9 with adjacent nodes 13, 8, 24
- Central node 11 with adjacent nodes 0, 20, 27
- Central node 14 with adjacent nodes 13, 11

Unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<13, (22, 3, 1)>
<4, (23, 28, 21)>
<18, (22, 3, 5)>
<8, (22, 23, 9)>
<23, (4, 8, 15)>
<20, (0, 27, 28)>
<26, (0, 19, 17)>
<28, (22, 4, 20)>
<19, (1, 26, 29)>
<10, (12, 15, 2)>
<15, (23, 10, 2)>
<9, (13, 8, 24)>
<11, (0, 20, 27)>
<14, (13, 11)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [14]
