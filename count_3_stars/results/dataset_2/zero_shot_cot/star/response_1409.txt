Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 7) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 9) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 6) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 6) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 17) (18, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 6) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (15, 19) (15, 2) (2, 15) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 2) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 17) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 10, 13)>
<2, (5, 12, 15)>
<4, (5, 6, 19)>
<5, (2, 12, 15)>
<6, (0, 7, 10)>
<19, (4, 12, 15)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
