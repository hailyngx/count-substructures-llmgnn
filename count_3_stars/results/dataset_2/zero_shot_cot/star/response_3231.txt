Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 18) (10, 14) (2, 16) (2, 18) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (19, 5) (19, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 1) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 11) (4, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (15, 18) (15, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking at each node and its neighbors:

1. Node 0: (0, 5, 2, 12) - <0, (5, 2, 12)>
2. Node 1: (1, 9, 14, 18) - <1, (9, 14, 18)>
3. Node 2: (2, 16, 0, 18) - <2, (16, 0, 18)>
4. Node 3: (3, 9, 7, 16) - <3, (9, 7, 16)>
5. Node 4: (4, 11, 19) - <4, (11, 19)>
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 9) - <5, (0, 9)>
7. Node 6: (6, 9, 14, 18) - <6, (9, 14, 18)>
8. Node 7: (7, 2, 3, 12) - <7, (2, 3, 12)>
9. Node 8: (8, 17, 1) - <8, (17, 1)>
10. Node 9: (9, 5, 1, 3) - <9, (5, 1, 3)>
11. Node 10: (10, 14) - <10, (14)>
12. Node 11: (11, 4, 16, 13) - <11, (4, 16, 13)>
13. Node 12: (12, 7, 0) - <12, (7, 0)>
14. Node 13: (13, 11, 7, 12) - <13, (11, 7, 12)>
15. Node 14: (14, 6, 1, 10) - <14, (6, 1, 10)>
16. Node 15: (15, 18, 17) - <15, (18, 17)>
17. Node 16: (16, 11, 2, 3) - <16, (11, 2, 3)>
18. Node 17: (17, 18, 8) - <17, (18, 8)>
19. Node 18: (18, 6, 2, 15) - <18, (6, 2, 15)>
20. Node 19: (19, 5, 4) - <19, (5, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
