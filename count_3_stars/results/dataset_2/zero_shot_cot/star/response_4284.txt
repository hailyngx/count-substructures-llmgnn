Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 24) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 29) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 16) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 19) (27, 29) (27, 11) (27, 2) (27, 13) (4, 6) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (29, 22) (29, 27) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 25) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 7) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 18) (21, 6) (21, 9) (21, 11) (18, 1) (18, 26) (18, 0) (26, 18) (26, 14) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 25) (3, 22) (3, 24) (3, 20) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 24) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 26) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (2, 27) (2, 16) (5, 24) (24, 9) (24, 3) (24, 20) (24, 5) (24, 25) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 15) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 13) (13, 27) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 16) (25, 10) (25, 15) (25, 24) (25, 11) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 25) (19, 12) (19, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to a node by exactly three edges, forming a 3-star pattern.

Nodes with exactly three incident edges:
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 21), (6, 15)
- Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 21), (9, 24)
- Node 22: (22, 23), (22, 14), (22, 29)
- Node 23: (23, 22), (23, 16), (16, 1)
- Node 12: (12, 14), (12, 0), (12, 19)
- Node 27: (27, 29), (27, 11), (27, 2)
- Node 4: (4, 6)
- Node 8: (8, 15), (8, 11), (8, 7)
- Node 29: (29, 22), (29, 27)
- Node 10: (10, 17), (10, 0), (10, 19)
- Node 17: (17, 10), (17, 1), (17, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 17), (1, 16), (1, 13)
- Node 21: (21, 6), (21, 9), (21, 11)
- Node 18: (18, 1), (18, 26), (18, 0)
- Node 26: (26, 18), (26, 14)
- Node 15: (15, 6), (15, 8), (15, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 22), (3, 24), (3, 20)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 21, 15)>
<9, (6, 21, 24)>
<22, (23, 14, 29)>
<23, (22, 16, 1)>
<12, (14, 0, 19)>
<27, (29, 11, 2)>
<8, (15, 11, 7)>
<29, (22, 27, 29)>
<10, (17, 0, 19)>
<17, (10, 1, 7)>
<1, (17, 16, 13)>
<21, (6, 9, 11)>
<18, (1, 26, 0)>
<26, (18, 14, 26)>
<15, (6, 8, 7)>
<3, (22, 24, 20)>

Therefore, there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
