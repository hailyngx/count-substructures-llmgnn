Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 9) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 19) (4, 12) (18, 14) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 10) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 11) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 9) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 0) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern. 

We will go through the list of edges and identify the 3-stars. 

1. 3-star centered at node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6) <1, (3, 5, 6)>
2. 3-star centered at node 2: (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 11) <2, (6, 9, 11)>
3. 3-star centered at node 5: (5, 1), (5, 15), (5, 17) <5, (1, 15, 17)>
4. 3-star centered at node 7: (7, 12), (7, 11), (7, 17) <7, (12, 11, 17)>
5. 3-star centered at node 8: (8, 10), (8, 14), (8, 15) <8, (10, 14, 15)>
6. 3-star centered at node 12: (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 17) <12, (4, 7, 17)>
7. 3-star centered at node 14: (14, 1), (14, 11), (14, 18) <14, (1, 11, 18)>
8. 3-star centered at node 16: (16, 0), (16, 10), (16, 1) <16, (0, 10, 1)>
9. 3-star centered at node 19: (19, 9), (19, 11), (19, 12) <19, (9, 11, 12)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
