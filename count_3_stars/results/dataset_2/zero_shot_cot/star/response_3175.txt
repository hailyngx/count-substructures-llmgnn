Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 8) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 13) (7, 6) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 12) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <3, (0, 15, 7)>
2. <3, (5, 17, 0)>
3. <3, (19, 17, 15)>
4. <2, (0, 9, 8)>
5. <2, (1, 9, 8)>
6. <14, (17, 10, 15)>
7. <12, (16, 4, 10)>
8. <7, (6, 15, 13)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
