Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (12, 16) (12, 10) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 6) (9, 7) (18, 15) (19, 15) (6, 13) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 0) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 5) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (10, 12) (10, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 3: <3, (15, 8, 16)>
2. Node 15: <15, (3, 19, 18)>
3. Node 16: <16, (3, 12, 4)>
4. Node 2: <2, (5, 1, 17)>
5. Node 13: <13, (17, 1, 0)>
6. Node 17: <17, (2, 13, 11)>
7. Node 11: <11, (17, 14, 0)>
8. Node 14: <14, (11, 1, 4)>
9. Node 6: <6, (13, 16, 10)>
10. Node 5: <5, (15, 2, 11)>
11. Node 1: <1, (2, 13, 14)>
12. Node 4: <4, (14, 16, 5)>
13. Node 0: <0, (13, 11, 6)>
14. Node 10: <10, (12, 6, 16)>
15. Node 7: <7, (2, 8, 9)>
16. Node 18: <18, (15, 19, None)>
17. Node 19: <19, (15, 18, None)>
18. Node 12: <12, (16, 10, None)>
19. Node 9: <9, (7, None, None)>

There are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
