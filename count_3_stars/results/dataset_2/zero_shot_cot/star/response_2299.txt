Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
The central node must be one of the nodes with degree 3. 
Nodes with degree 3 are 5, 4, 8, 11, and 13.

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each candidate central node:

For central node 5:
Out of the neighbors (9, 1, 4), none form a 3-star with node 5.

For central node 4:
Out of the neighbors (5, 8, 10), a 3-star is formed with nodes (5, 8, 10). <4, (5, 8, 10)>

For central node 8:
Out of the neighbors (6, 4, 14), a 3-star is formed with nodes (4, 6, 14). <8, (4, 6, 14)>

For central node 11:
Out of the neighbors (9, 7, 14), a 3-star is formed with nodes (7, 9, 14). <11, (7, 9, 14)>

For central node 13:
Out of the neighbors (4, 3, 10), a 3-star is formed with nodes (3, 4, 10). <13, (3, 4, 10)>

The final answer is [4].
