Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes connected to node 5 since it has the highest degree in the graph.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 1, 4, and 7.
Next, we check each of these nodes for 3-stars.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 1, forming <9, (5, 8, 1)>.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 4, forming <2, (5, 1, 4)>.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3, forming <1, (5, 9, 3)>.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 3, forming <4, (5, 7, 3)>.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 0, forming <7, (5, 4, 0)>.

Now, count the number of distinct 3-stars found: [5]. 
So, the final answer is [5].
