Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 5: Connected to nodes 6, 4, and 3
   <5, (6, 4, 3)>

2. Node 9: Connected to nodes 8, 7, and 8 (note: although 8 is repeated twice, we count it as two separate edges)
   <9, (8, 7, 8)>

So, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
