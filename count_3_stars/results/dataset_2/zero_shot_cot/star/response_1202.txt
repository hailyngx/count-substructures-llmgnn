Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 25) (26, 8) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 16) (14, 24) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 2) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 12) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 3) (3, 22) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 29) (25, 26) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 4) (0, 18) (0, 29) (0, 1) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 15) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 10) (20, 22) (20, 13) (20, 11) (29, 3) (29, 0) (29, 12) (21, 13) (8, 26) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 16) (4, 25) (12, 18) (12, 29) (28, 17) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 2) (24, 14) (24, 3) (24, 11) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 19) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 11) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 23) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 27) (7, 6) (7, 27) (27, 18) (27, 16) (27, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars.

The potential centers are: 26, 5, 3, 0, 13, 15, 20, 29, 1, 6, 12, 11, 24, 23, 2, 19, 16, 7, 27.

Next, we will check each potential center to see if they form a 3-star with exactly 3 other nodes.

After checking, we find the following 3-stars:
<5, (1, 6, 16)>
<3, (22, 25, 24)>
<0, (18, 29, 1)>
<13, (26, 21, 15)>
<15, (9, 13, 10)>
<20, (22, 13, 11)>
<29, (3, 0, 12)>
<1, (5, 0, 19)>
<6, (1, 7, 2)>
<12, (18, 29, 0)>
<11, (22, 20, 24)>
<24, (14, 3, 11)>
<23, (5, 17, 19)>
<2, (26, 17, 6)>
<19, (1, 11, 23)>
<16, (5, 17, 27)>
<7, (6, 27, 1)>
<27, (18, 16, 7)>

Therefore, there are 18 unique 3-stars. So, the answer is [18].
