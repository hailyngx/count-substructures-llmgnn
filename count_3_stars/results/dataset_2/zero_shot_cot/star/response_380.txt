Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (17, 7) (17, 19) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (19, 17) (19, 18) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 15) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 6) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (6, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first list out the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (8, 13, 14)>
<1, (2, 3, 12)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 12)>
<4, (6, 12, 16)>
<5, (9, 15, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 13)>
<7, (3, 17, 1)>
<8, (0, 9, 15)>
<9, (2, 5, 13)>
<12, (1, 3, 4)>
<13, (0, 6, 9)>
<14, (0, 8, 3)>
<15, (5, 8, 18)>
<16, (4, 6, 13)>
<17, (3, 7, 19)>
<18, (15, 19, 11)>
<19, (17, 18, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
