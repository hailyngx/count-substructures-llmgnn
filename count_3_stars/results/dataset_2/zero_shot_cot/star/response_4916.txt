Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 4) (18, 11) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 16) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 3) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 16) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 4 to determine the 3-stars connected to the center node 4. The nodes connected to node 4 are 7, 18, 0, 10, and 15.

Now, let's list the 3-stars with the center node 4:
<4, (7, 0, 10)>
<4, (7, 0, 15)>
<4, (7, 10, 18)>
<4, (10, 0, 15)>
<4, (0, 10, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.
