Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 6) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, denoted as follows: <0, (7, 11, 8)>, <1, (3, 13, 14)>, <2, (7, 10, 6)>, <3, (1, 13, 5)>, <4, (9, 12, 14)>, <10, (9, 1, 14)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
