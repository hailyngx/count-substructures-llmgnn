Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the 3-stars:

<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (10, 0, 12)>
<2, (5, 6, 10)>
<6, (7, 0, 14)>
<0, (5, 6, 13)>
<5, (2, 8, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 14)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<11, (10, 1, 13)>
<12, (1, 14, 11)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
