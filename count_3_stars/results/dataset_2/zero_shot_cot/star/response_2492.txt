Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 21) (9, 20) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 14) (21, 9) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 12) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 22) (26, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 27) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 13) (27, 6) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 20) (15, 28) (15, 22) (15, 24) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 7) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 27) (23, 18) (0, 17) (2, 9) (2, 10) (12, 21) (12, 6) (12, 8) (29, 1) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (14, 1) (14, 27) (14, 20) (22, 25) (22, 15) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 14) (18, 13) (18, 23) (19, 3) (19, 13) (24, 15) (24, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Calculating the degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 1
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 5
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 5
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 2
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 2
Node 19: degree 2
Node 20: degree 4
Node 21: degree 4
Node 22: degree 2
Node 23: degree 4
Node 24: degree 2
Node 25: degree 3
Node 26: degree 1
Node 27: degree 4
Node 28: degree 2
Node 29: degree 1

Based on the degrees of the nodes, we can conclude that there are 5 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (25, 11, 17)>
<4, (9, 27, 13)>
<7, (3, 17, 8)>
<11, (3, 26, 23)>
<21, (9, 1, 16)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
