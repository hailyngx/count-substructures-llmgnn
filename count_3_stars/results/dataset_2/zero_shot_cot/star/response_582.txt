Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 7) (15, 17) (15, 11) (12, 5) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 5) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 16) (11, 1) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 11) (0, 17) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 9) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's identify all the central nodes:
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (8, 13, 14) -> <4, (8, 13, 14)>
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (4, 16, 6) -> <8, (4, 16, 6)>
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors (2, 19, 6) -> <18, (2, 19, 6)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (11, 9, 7) -> <1, (11, 9, 7)>
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors (17, 11) but cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 12 has 1 neighbor (5) which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (1, 16, 10, 9, 13) -> <7, (1, 16, 10)>
- Node 16 has 3 neighbors (8, 7, 5) -> <16, (8, 7, 5)>
- Node 19 has 3 neighbors (18, 14, 3) -> <19, (18, 14, 3)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 12, 16) -> <5, (2, 12, 16)>
- Node 11 has 5 neighbors (1, 15, 0, 6, 17) -> <11, (1, 0, 17)>
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (11, 17) but cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (19, 14, 13) -> <3, (19, 14, 13)>
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (4, 19, 3, 10) which is too many to form a 3-star.
- Node 17 has 3 neighbors (15, 11, 0) -> <17, (15, 11, 0)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 13) -> <9, (1, 7, 13)>
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors (7, 14) but cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 13 has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 3, 9) which is too many to form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (8, 18, 11) -> <6, (8, 18, 11)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<4, (8, 13, 14)>, <8, (4, 16, 6)>, <18, (2, 19, 6)>, <1, (11, 9, 7)>, <7, (1, 16, 10)>, <16, (8, 7, 5)>, <19, (18, 14, 3)>, <5, (2, 12, 16)>, <11, (1, 0, 17)>, <3, (19, 14, 13)>, <17, (15, 11, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 13)>, <6, (8, 18, 11)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
