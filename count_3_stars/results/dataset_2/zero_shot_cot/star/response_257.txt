Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them first:

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 6, and 1.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 0.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 5.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 3.

Now, we can list the 3-stars present in this graph:
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<5, (8, 6, 1)>
<2, (7, 8, 5)>
<9, (7, 8, 0)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<0, (9, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
