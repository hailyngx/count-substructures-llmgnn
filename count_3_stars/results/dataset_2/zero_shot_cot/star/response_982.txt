Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 10) (7, 18) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 10) (19, 0) (19, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 18) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (11, 4, 19)>
<1, (16, 4, 18)>
<2, (3, 5, 10)>
<3, (15, 2, 12)>
<4, (0, 1, 14)>
<5, (3, 6, 2)>
<6, (16, 5, 10)>
<7, (10, 18, 7)>
<8, (11, 9, 18)>
<9, (15, 14, 8)>
<10, (7, 6, 12)>
<11, (16, 0, 8)>
<12, (3, 10, 2)>
<13, (15, 14, 1)>
<14, (17, 13, 4)>
<15, (3, 9, 13)>
<16, (11, 1, 6)>
<17, (14, 18, 7)>
<18, (7, 1, 8)>
<19, (0, 1, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [20].
