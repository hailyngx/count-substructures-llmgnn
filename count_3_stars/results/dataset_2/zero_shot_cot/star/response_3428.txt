Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (4, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 8), (5, 11) [3-stars: <5, (9, 13, 8)>, <5, (9, 8, 11)>]
2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 0) [3-stars: <9, (5, 8, 7)>]
3. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 14), (8, 6), (8, 3) [3-stars: <8, (5, 9, 14)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>]
4. Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 14), (13, 0) [No 3-star]
5. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 1) [3-stars: <7, (9, 0, 12)>]
6. Node 12: (12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 0), (12, 11) [3-stars: <12, (7, 10, 0)>]
7. Node 3: (3, 8), (3, 11) [No 3-star]
8. Node 11: (11, 5), (11, 12), (11, 3), (11, 14), (11, 1) [3-stars: <11, (5, 12, 3)>]
9. Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 13), (0, 7), (0, 12), (0, 10), (0, 6) [No 3-star]
10. Node 4: (4, 2) [No 3-star]
11. Node 10: (10, 12), (10, 0), (10, 6), (10, 1) [No 3-star]
12. Node 14: (14, 8), (14, 13), (14, 11), (14, 6) [3-stars: <14, (8, 11, 6)>]
13. Node 1: (1, 7), (1, 11), (1, 10), (1, 2) [No 3-star]
14. Node 6: (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 0), (6, 10), (6, 14), (6, 2) [No 3-star]
15. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 6) [No 3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
