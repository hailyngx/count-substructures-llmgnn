Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with 3 connections to other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 6 is a central node connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4. (<6, (1, 3, 4)>)
2. Node 0 is a central node connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8. (<0, (2, 4, 8)>)
3. Node 7 is a central node connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. (<7, (1, 2, 3)>)

Count of 3-stars: [3]
