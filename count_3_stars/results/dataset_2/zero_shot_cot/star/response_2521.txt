Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 17) (7, 12) (7, 16) (14, 6) (14, 5) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 19) (8, 4) (8, 19) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 6) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 10) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 6) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 6) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 16) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 15) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 16) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 2) (18, 9) (18, 0) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 18
   - Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 12, 15
   - Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 5, 16
   - Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 9, 11
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 0, 8, 17
   - Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 13, 14, 19
   - Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 19
   - Node 7: Connected to nodes 12, 16
   - Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 8, 19
   - Node 9: Connected to nodes 3, 6, 9, 16, 18
   - Node 10: Connected to nodes 0, 12, 13
   - Node 11: Connected to nodes 3, 6, 11
   - Node 12: Connected to nodes 1, 7, 10, 16
   - Node 13: Connected to nodes 5, 10, 13, 17
   - Node 14: Connected to nodes 5, 6
   - Node 15: Connected to nodes 1, 6
   - Node 16: Connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, 9, 12, 16
   - Node 17: Connected to nodes 4, 13, 17, 19
   - Node 18: Connected to nodes 0, 9, 18
   - Node 19: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 13, 16, 17

2. Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
   - <4, (0, 8, 17)>
   - <5, (1, 2, 19)>
   - <6, (9, 11, 15)>
   - <12, (1, 7, 16)>
   - <16, (2, 6, 9)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [5]

So, the final answer is [5].
