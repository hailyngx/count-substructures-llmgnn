Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3. 

Nodes with degree 3: 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 0, 2, and 8

Next, we can check which of these nodes form 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (8, 1, 9)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (0, 5, 9)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (6, 7, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
