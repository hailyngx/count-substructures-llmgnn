Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (15, 9) (19, 4) (19, 9) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 13) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (16, 9) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node with 3 edges:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 10.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 12.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 11, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 15.

2. Next, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<2, (3, 7, 12)>
<8, (0, 11, 14)>
<9, (10, 12, 15)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
