Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 7) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 13) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

First, let's list out all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (8, 5, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<2, (0, 4, 11)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (10, 2, 14)>
<5, (1, 0, 12)>
<6, (7, 13, 5)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (12, 1, 14)>
<9, (0, 12, 13)>
<10, (1, 4, 5)>
<12, (1, 5, 14)>
<13, (12, 6, 9)>
<14, (8, 12, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
