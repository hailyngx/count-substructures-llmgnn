Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the potential central nodes in the graph. The central nodes in a 3-star graph will have degree 3. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 9 have degree 3.

Next, let's determine the leaves of each potential 3-star by checking the neighbors of each central node. We will consider the nodes that are connected to the central node but not connected to each other. 

For Node 0:
- Leaves: 2, 5, 6
<0, (2, 5, 6)>

For Node 2:
- Leaves: 0, 1, 6
<2, (0, 1, 6)>

For Node 4:
- Leaves: 1, 3, 9
<4, (1, 3, 9)>

For Node 5:
- Leaves: 0, 3, 9
<5, (0, 3, 9)>

For Node 7:
- Leaves: 0, 3, 9
<7, (0, 3, 9)>

For Node 9:
- Leaves: 4, 6, 7
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found and listed the following:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
