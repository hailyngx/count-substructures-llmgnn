Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) 

Response:
Let's start counting the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0 has 3 edges: (0, 9), (0, 11), (0, 6)
  - <0, (9, 11, 6)>

- Node 1 has 5 edges: (1, 7), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 12)
  - <1, (7, 3, 6)>
  - <1, (7, 2, 12)>
  
- Node 2 has 6 edges: (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 1), (2, 11), (2, 13), (2, 14)
  - <2, (5, 4, 14)>
  - <2, (5, 1, 13)>

- Node 3 has 3 edges: (3, 1), (3, 12), (3, 8)
  - <3, (1, 12, 8)>

- Node 4 has 5 edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 14), (4, 6), (4, 2)
  - <4, (7, 8, 14)>

- Node 5 has 2 edges: (5, 2), (5, 8)

- Node 6 has 4 edges: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 0)
  - <6, (4, 7, 0)>

- Node 7 has 5 edges: (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 8)

- Node 8 has 5 edges: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 3)
  - <8, (5, 9, 3)>

- Node 9 has 4 edges: (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 13), (9, 0)

- Node 10 has 3 edges: (10, 12), (10, 13), (10, 14)

- Node 11 has 2 edges: (11, 0), (11, 2)

- Node 12 has 4 edges: (12, 1), (12, 3), (12, 10), (12, 14)

- Node 13 has 3 edges: (13, 9), (13, 10), (13, 2)

- Node 14 has 5 edges: (14, 5), (14, 4), (14, 10), (14, 2), (14, 12)

Total number of 3-stars: [6] 
Unique 3-stars: <<0, (9, 11, 6)>, <1, (7, 3, 6)>, <1, (7, 2, 12)>, <2, (5, 4, 14)>, <2, (5, 1, 13)>, <8, (5, 9, 3)>>
