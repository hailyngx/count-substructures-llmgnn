Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
We can count the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying all sets of nodes that form 3-stars. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3)
   <5, (1, 4, 0)>
   [1]

2. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 10), (9, 13)
   <9, (6, 2, 10)>
   [2]

3. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 12), (6, 4), (6, 13)
   <6, (9, 3, 2)>
   <6, (9, 12, 4)>
   [4]

4. Node 10: (10, 9), (10, 12), (10, 7), (10, 13)
   <10, (9, 12, 7)>
   [5]

5. Node 11: (11, 14), (11, 8), (11, 4), (11, 2)
   <11, (14, 8, 4)>
   <11, (14, 8, 2)>
   [7]

6. Node 7: (7, 10), (7, 12), (7, 1), (7, 8)
   <7, (10, 12, 1)>
   [8]

7. Node 12: (12, 6), (12, 10), (12, 7), (12, 0)
   <12, (6, 10, 0)>
   [9]

8. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 11), (2, 8), (2, 14)
   <2, (9, 6, 11)>
   <2, (9, 6, 14)>
   [11]

9. Node 8: (8, 11), (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 14)
   <8, (11, 7, 2)>
   <8, (11, 7, 14)>
   [13]

10. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 11), (4, 14)
    <4, (5, 6, 11)>
    [14]

11. Node 14: (14, 11), (14, 2), (14, 8), (14, 4)
    <14, (11, 2, 8)>
    [15]

12. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 6)
    No 3-star

13. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 13)
    No 3-star

14. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 13)
    No 3-star

15. Node 13: (13, 9), (13, 6), (13, 10), (13, 0), (13, 1)
    No 3-star

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
