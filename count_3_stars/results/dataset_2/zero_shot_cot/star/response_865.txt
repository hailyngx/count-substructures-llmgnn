Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 adjacent edges are nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

1. For node 1: <1, (6, 4, 7)>
2. For node 3: <3, (4, 5, 7)>
3. For node 4: <4, (3, 7, 8)>
4. For node 5: <5, (2, 3, 7)>
5. For node 6: <6, (1, 8, 9)>
6. For node 7: <7, (4, 5, 9)>
7. For node 8: <8, (1, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
