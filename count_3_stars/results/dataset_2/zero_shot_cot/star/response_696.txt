Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars we can find in this graph:

<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (9, 2, 0)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (9, 3, -)>
<6, (5, 3, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<7, (9, 1, 6)>

There are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
