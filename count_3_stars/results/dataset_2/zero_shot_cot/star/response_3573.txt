Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (4, 10) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 6) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 17) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 2) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 7) (13, 18) (13, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Start by listing the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 14, 17
- Node 1: 3, 14, 19
- Node 2: 9, 10, 17
- Node 3: 1, 5
- Node 4: 10, 12
- Node 5: 3, 7, 14
- Node 6: 7, 15, 19
- Node 7: 5, 6, 8, 13, 15
- Node 8: 7, 9, 11
- Node 9: 2, 8, 15, 17
- Node 10: 2, 4
- Node 11: 8, 18
- Node 12: 4, 16, 18
- Node 13: 7, 18
- Node 14: 0, 1, 5
- Node 15: 6, 7, 9
- Node 16: 12, 17, 19
- Node 17: 0, 2, 9, 16
- Node 18: 11, 12, 13, 19
- Node 19: 1, 6, 16, 18

2. Count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- The 3-stars can be created by selecting one central node and three leaf nodes connected to it.
- Each 3-star can be uniquely represented, regardless of the order of nodes within it.

3. Identify the 3-stars:
<1, (3, 14, 19)>
<5, (3, 7, 14)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (2, 15, 17)>
<18, (11, 12, 13)>
<19, (16, 18, 6)>

4. Count the total number of 3-stars: [6]
