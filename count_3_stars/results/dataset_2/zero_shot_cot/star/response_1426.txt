Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 21) (3, 12) (3, 18) (15, 22) (15, 25) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 29) (8, 6) (8, 23) (8, 21) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 12) (4, 13) (4, 28) (4, 29) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 27) (26, 12) (28, 4) (28, 27) (28, 5) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 19) (29, 12) (0, 23) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (21, 3) (21, 8) (21, 13) (21, 20) (13, 4) (13, 21) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 25) (2, 22) (22, 15) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 27) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 20) (25, 15) (25, 1) (25, 17) (11, 14) (11, 27) (11, 12) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 14) (20, 21) (20, 16) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 10) (27, 26) (27, 28) (27, 22) (27, 11) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 16) (10, 19) (5, 28) (5, 19) (12, 3) (12, 23) (12, 26) (12, 29) (12, 11) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in the given graph. Let's find and count them step by step.

1. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (3, 21), (3, 12), (3, 18) -> <3, (21, 12, 18)>
2. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 10) -> <6, (9, 7, 10)>
3. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (8, 23), (8, 21), (8, 18) -> <8, (23, 21, 18)>
4. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (4, 13), (4, 28), (4, 29) -> <4, (13, 28, 29)>
5. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (1, 26), (1, 25), (1, 7) -> <1, (26, 25, 7)>
6. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (26, 27), (26, 12), (26, 1) -> <26, (27, 12, 1)>
7. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (28, 5), (28, 27), (28, 4) -> <28, (5, 27, 4)>
8. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (27, 11), (27, 22), (27, 26) -> <27, (11, 22, 26)>
9. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (10, 23), (10, 16), (10, 19) -> <10, (23, 16, 19)>
10. Nodes connected to each other by edges: (12, 29), (12, 11), (12, 26) -> <12, (29, 11, 26)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.]
