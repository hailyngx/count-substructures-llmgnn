The edges are as follows: (13, 25) (13, 9) (22, 19) (22, 25) (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 1) (16, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 20) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 23) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 21) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 5) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 21) (29, 10) (4, 27) (4, 12) (8, 29) (8, 19) (8, 25) (19, 22) (19, 8) (19, 25) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (21, 16) (21, 27) (21, 29) (21, 24) (10, 0) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 23) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 7) (7, 11) (7, 26) (7, 24) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 23) (5, 15) (23, 0) (23, 10) (23, 5) (3, 16) (3, 17) (3, 24) (17, 2) (17, 3) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 24) (24, 21) (24, 7) (24, 3) (24, 15) (20, 9) (20, 26) (1, 16) (1, 0) (25, 13) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 19) (14, 12) (14, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are the central nodes of 3-stars. They are nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edge list, the nodes and their degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 2
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 2
- Node 18: degree 2
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 4
- Node 25: degree 4
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 2
- Node 29: degree 4

Nodes 0, 1, 4, 13, 14, 17, 18, 22, and 28 are not central nodes of any 3-stars since they have at most 2 edges connected.

Next, let's find the 3-stars by looking at the nodes that are connected to each central node. 

For example, for central node 2, the nodes connected are 11, 18, and 17. This forms a 3-star: <2, (11, 18, 17)>. 

Similarly, by checking the connections for the remaining central nodes, we find the following unique 3-stars:
- <6, (11, 9, 12)>
- <7, (11, 26, 24)>
- <8, (29, 25, 19)>
- <9, (13, 6, 20)>
- <10, (0, 29, 23)>
- <15, (5, 14, 24)>
- <16, (11, 21, 1)>
- <21, (27, 29, 24)>
- <25, (13, 22, 8)>
- <26, (20, 10, 7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found gives us a total of [10].
