Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 4, 7, 3, 8, 5, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors: 4, 7, 3, 6, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 8, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors: 1, 0, 9, 8
- Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 0, 2, 1
- Node 5 has neighbors: 7, 2, 0
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 0, 5, 1
- Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 0, 2
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 3, 2, 0

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

Number of 3-stars = [7]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 6)>
