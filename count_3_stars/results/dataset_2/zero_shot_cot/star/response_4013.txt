Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 18) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 18) (19, 9) (19, 18) (0, 6) (0, 16) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 5) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 14) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 12) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

We see that the central node of a 3-star must have exactly three neighbors. Let's identify all such nodes:

- Node 6 has neighbors: [9, 11, 8]
- Node 9 has neighbors: [6, 2, 19]
- Node 4 has neighbors: [15, 7]
- Node 7 has neighbors: [4, 10, 14]
- Node 10 has neighbors: [7, 11, 5]
- Node 11 has neighbors: [6, 10, 1]
- Node 8 has neighbors: [6, 18]
- Node 1 has neighbors: [15, 11, 14]
- Node 14 has neighbors: [7, 1, 13, 18, 5]
- Node 5 has neighbors: [10, 1, 16, 14]
- Node 2 has neighbors: [3, 15, 9, 12]
- Node 12 has neighbors: [15, 11, 2]
- Node 15 has neighbors: [3, 1, 12, 4, 2]
- Node 18 has neighbors: [8, 17, 19, 14]

Now, let's list all unique 3-stars found:

<6, (9, 11, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 19)>
<4, (15, 7, X)>
<7, (4, 10, 14)>
<10, (7, 11, 5)>
<11, (6, 10, 1)>
<8, (6, 18, X)>
<1, (15, 11, 14)>
<14, (7, 1, 13)>
<5, (10, 1, 16)>
<2, (3, 15, 12)>
<12, (15, 11, 2)>
<15, (3, 1, 12)>
<18, (8, 17, 19)>

There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
