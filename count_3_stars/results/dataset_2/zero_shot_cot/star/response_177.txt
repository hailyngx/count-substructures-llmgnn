Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 16) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 0) (7, 15) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 17) (1, 10) (5, 8) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 4) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 15) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 5) (10, 14) (10, 18) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 15, 18)>
<3, (0, 15, 16)>
<4, (11, 15, 19)>
<5, (8, 16, 19)>
<8, (5, 13, 19)>
<10, (14, 17, 18)>
<11, (4, 12, 19)>
<12, (9, 13, 17)>
<13, (8, 12, 16)>
<14, (10, 17, 18)>
<15, (0, 3, 4)>
<16, (3, 5, 13)>
<17, (1, 12, 14)>
<18, (10, 14, 0)>
<19, (4, 5, 11)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
