Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The count of 3-star graphs is [6], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 11, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 14)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 10)>
<5, (8, 11, 14)>
