Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 10) (16, 20) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 28) (18, 15) (18, 14) (18, 17) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 3) (23, 29) (23, 21) (23, 12) (10, 16) (10, 17) (17, 18) (17, 10) (17, 20) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 4) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 0) (29, 23) (29, 28) (29, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 22) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 25) (13, 1) (26, 16) (26, 25) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 19) (24, 21) (20, 16) (20, 17) (20, 12) (7, 24) (7, 25) (7, 9) (25, 13) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 8) (8, 11) (8, 25) (8, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (4, 11) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 6) (21, 22) (21, 23) (21, 24) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 24) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 23) (3, 0) (14, 18) (12, 23) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 16
   Leaves: 3, 26, 10
   <16, (3, 26, 10)>

2. Central node: 15
   Leaves: 27, 19, 18
   <15, (27, 19, 18)>

3. Central node: 27
   Leaves: 15, 2, 28
   <27, (15, 2, 28)>

4. Central node: 18
   Leaves: 15, 14, 17
   <18, (15, 14, 17)>

5. Central node: 23
   Leaves: 22, 3, 29
   <23, (22, 3, 29)>

6. Central node: 25
   Leaves: 13, 26, 7
   <25, (13, 26, 7)>

7. Central node: 8
   Leaves: 11, 25, 12
   <8, (11, 25, 12)>

8. Central node: 20
   Leaves: 16, 17, 12
   <20, (16, 17, 12)>

9. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 27, 5, 4
   <2, (27, 5, 4)>

10. Central node: 28
    Leaves: 27, 29, 0
    <28, (27, 29, 0)>

11. Central node: 24
    Leaves: 7, 9, 19
    <24, (7, 9, 19)>

12. Central node: 12
    Leaves: 23, 5, 20
