Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 4) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as these will be the centers of the 3-stars. We will then list the 3-stars around each center node.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 2, 5, 14.

For the node 0:
- <0, (1, 4, 11)>

For the node 2:
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>

For the node 5:
- <5, (2, 7, 8)>

For the node 14:
- <14, (3, 6, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we have found 4 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
