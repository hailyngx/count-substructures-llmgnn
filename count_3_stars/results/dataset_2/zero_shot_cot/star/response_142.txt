Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 21) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 4) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 21) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (28, 11) (28, 24) (29, 9) (29, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (11, 26) (11, 28) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 14) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 2) (15, 13) (15, 29) (15, 16) (15, 10) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 27) (20, 8) (2, 11) (2, 25) (22, 14) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 24) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 18) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 27) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 0) (14, 5) (14, 22) (14, 21) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 23) (23, 18) (27, 16) (27, 24) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 19) (21, 9) (21, 4) (21, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 9 forms 3-stars with nodes 26, 29, and 0.
- Node 26 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 25, and 11.
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 10, and 5.
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with nodes 13, 4, and 20.
- Node 13 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 8, and 15.
- Node 4 forms 3-stars with nodes 26, 8, and 21.
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 13, and 12.
- Node 25 forms 3-stars with nodes 26, 16, and 2.
- Node 15 forms 3-stars with nodes 13, 29, and 16.
- Node 16 forms 3-stars with nodes 25, 15, and 18.
- Node 18 forms 3-stars with nodes 3, 8, and 16.
- Node 24 forms 3-stars with nodes 28, 5, and 17.
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 12, and 19.
- Node 21 forms 3-stars with nodes 9, 4, and 14.

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:

<9, (26, 29, 0)>
<26, (9, 25, 11)>
<3, (1, 10, 5)>
<8, (13, 4, 20)>
<13, (9, 8, 15)>
<4, (26, 8, 21)>
<5, (3, 13, 12)>
<25, (26, 16, 2)>
<15, (13, 29, 16)>
<16, (25, 15, 18)>
<18, (3, 8, 16)>
<24, (28, 5, 17)>
<0, (9, 12, 19)>
<21, (9, 4, 14)>
