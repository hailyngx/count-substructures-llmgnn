Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given data.

1. <5, (6, 4, 3)>
2. <6, (5, 9, 3)>
3. <9, (6, 8, 4)>
4. <4, (5, 9, 2)>
5. <7, (9, 8, 3)>
6. <8, (9, 6, 1)>
7. <2, (5, 4, 3)>
8. <0, (6, 7, 3)>
9. <1, (7, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [9].
