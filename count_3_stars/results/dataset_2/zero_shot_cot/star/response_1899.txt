Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 2) (9, 10) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to look for nodes with exactly three neighbors. 

Based on the given edges, we have the following central nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 2, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 8, 8)>
- Node 3 forms two 3-stars: <3, (1, 2, 14)> and <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 12)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (3, 8, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we have a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
