Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 11) (9, 3) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 17) (14, 27) (14, 19) (14, 25) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 2) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 23) (3, 19) (25, 14) (25, 28) (25, 18) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 0) (22, 8) (23, 3) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 28) (7, 20) (7, 27) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 4) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 5) (4, 21) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 24) (18, 25) (18, 4) (18, 20) (15, 21) (15, 0) (20, 7) (20, 18) (20, 11) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 25) (28, 23) (28, 2) (29, 9) (29, 6) (0, 22) (0, 15) (0, 12) (6, 1) (6, 29) (10, 13) (2, 17) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 24) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 4) (24, 5) (24, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 27) (27, 14) (27, 7) (27, 13) (8, 22) (8, 21) (8, 11) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 3) (11, 9) (11, 20) (11, 5) (11, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to node 9 as that could be a potential center of a 3-star:
(9, 22), (9, 29), (9, 11), (9, 3)

Based on the given edges, we can list the 3-stars with center node 9:
<9, (22, 29, 11)>
<9, (22, 3, 28)>
<9, (22, 3, 23)>

Next, let's identify the nodes connected to node 26:
(26, 1), (26, 28), (26, 17)

List of 3-stars with center node 26:
<26, (1, 28, 17)>

Similarly, let's identify the nodes connected to node 14:
(14, 27), (14, 19), (14, 25)

List of 3-stars with center node 14:
<14, (27, 19, 25)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars:
