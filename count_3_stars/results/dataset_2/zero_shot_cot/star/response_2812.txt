Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 23) (15, 18) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 21) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 21) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 7) (26, 3) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 0) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 23) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 16) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 19) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 25) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 10) (27, 18) (11, 24) (11, 25) (11, 29) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 21) (17, 13) (8, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 14) (6, 24) (6, 22) (6, 0) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 0) (24, 22) (10, 26) (10, 4) (29, 1) (29, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 6) (0, 24) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 25) (22, 6) (22, 24) (7, 1) (7, 5) (25, 28) (25, 11) (25, 14) (21, 2) (21, 18) (21, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count the 3-stars.

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 28, 0, and 20: <3, (28, 0, 20)>
2. Node 15 is connected to nodes 20, 0, and 23: <15, (20, 0, 23)>
3. Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 21, and 27: <18, (2, 21, 27)>
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 13, and 23: <5, (2, 13, 23)>
5. Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, 28, and 0: <26, (1, 28, 0)>
6. Node 16 is connected to nodes 5, 28, and 4: <16, (5, 28, 4)>
7. Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 17, and 4: <13, (5, 17, 4)>
8. Node 19 is connected to nodes 13, 16, and 8: <19, (13, 16, 8)>
9. Node 24 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 22: <24, (11, 6, 22)>
10. Node 1 is connected to nodes 26, 29, and 7: <1, (26, 29, 7)>
11. Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 19, and 25: <14, (1, 19, 25)>
12. Node 21 is connected to nodes 2, 18, and 23: <21, (2, 18, 23)>

Therefore, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
