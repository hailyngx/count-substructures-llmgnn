Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 3)>
<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<3, (9, 1, 2)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 9, 5)>
<8, (6, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
<0, (6, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

<6, (9, 1, 8)>, <9, (6, 2, 3)>, <1, (6, 9, 7)>, <3, (9, 1, 2)>, <4, (6, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 9, 5)>, <8, (6, 4, 2)>, <2, (9, 3, 8)>, <0, (6, 4, 5)>, <5, (1, 8, 0)>
