Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (18, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 15) (3, 9) (3, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 13) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 17) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 1) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph:
- There are 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (11, 16, 14)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (16, 9, 8)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (9, 18, 12)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (7, 17, 12)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (9, 6, 17)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (5, 1, 17)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (4, 12, 17)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (11, 5, 2)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 10: <10, (6, 19, 1)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 11: <11, (1, 9, 13)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 12: <12, (7, 2, 15)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 13: <13, (11, 6, 19)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 14: <14, (1, 0, 16)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 15: <15, (12, 19, 17)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 16: <16, (1, 2, 14)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 17: <17, (9, 7, 6)>
- There are 3-star centered at node 19: <19, (15, 10, 13)>

Finally, we count the total number of 3-stars:
