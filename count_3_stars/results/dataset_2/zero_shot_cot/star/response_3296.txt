Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify all the nodes. The nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, let's go through each node to see if it forms any 3-star. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Since the degree of each node is not explicitly given, we will need to count the edges for each node.

After analyzing the graph, the 3-star configurations are as follows:
<1, (0, 7, 10)>
<2, (0, 4, 13)>
<3, (2, 5, 13)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 14)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 13)>
<9, (6, 7, 10)>
<10, (1, 9, 11)>
<11, (6, 10, 12)>
<12, (0, 10, 14)>
<13, (2, 8, 14)>
<14, (3, 6, 12)>

Thus, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
