Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 27) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 7) (3, 25) (3, 9) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 8) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 21) (2, 11) (29, 2) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 7) (20, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (26, 0) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 19) (28, 22) (28, 27) (27, 14) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 18) (27, 9) (10, 14) (10, 20) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 21) (16, 17) (16, 24) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 24) (19, 15) (19, 13) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 23) (5, 4) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (23, 5) (23, 21) (6, 14) (6, 22) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 1) (9, 3) (9, 27) (18, 24) (18, 27) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 19) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 21) (8, 22) (22, 28) (22, 6) (22, 8) (21, 2) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 8) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify the nodes with edges. This graph has nodes from 0 to 29, with nodes 0 to 29 being connected by the given edges.

The nodes with degree 3 are:
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 17, 6, 27)
- Node 17 (connected to nodes 14, 16, 11)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 25, 9, 5)
- Node 25 (connected to nodes 3, 27, 8)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 29, 5, 13)
- Node 11 (connected to nodes 17, 2, 1)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 3, 2, 12)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
There are 7 unique 3-stars, which are:
<14, (17, 6, 27)>
<17, (14, 16, 11)>
<3, (25, 9, 5)>
<25, (3, 27, 8)>
<2, (29, 5, 13)>
<11, (17, 2, 1)>
<5, (3, 2, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
