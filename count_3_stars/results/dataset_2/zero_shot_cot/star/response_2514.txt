Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 9) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 5) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 5) (5, 16) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 12) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 15) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 16) 

Response:
We will count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 4
- Node 17: degree 1
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- (4, 6, 14): <4, (6, 14)>
- (7, 9, 13): <7, (9, 13)>
- (10, 0, 18): <10, (0, 18)>
- (10, 4, 6): <10, (4, 6)>
- (19, 2, 12): <19, (2, 12)>
- (16, 5, 10): <16, (5, 10)>
- (11, 1, 3): <11, (1, 3)>
- (8, 16, 13): <8, (16, 13)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
