Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 17) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 13) (4, 9) (18, 19) (18, 13) (18, 8) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 18) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 1) (16, 7) (16, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 9) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 2) (2, 19) (2, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 17) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify all nodes in the graph: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

2. Look for triplets of nodes where one node is connected to three other nodes. We can find such triplets based on the edges provided.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 14, 16)>
<1, (10, 19, 2)>
<2, (1, 19, 1)>
<3, (0, 15, 12)>
<5, (6, 14, 5)>
<7, (14, 11, 7)>
<8, (12, 18, 19)>
<9, (4, 11, 17)>
<11, (7, 13, 17)>
<12, (3, 10, 8)>
<13, (3, 14, 18)>
<14, (0, 5, 13)>
<15, (3, 10, 17)>
<16, (0, 7, 14)>
<17, (11, 15, 9)>
<18, (8, 13, 19)>
