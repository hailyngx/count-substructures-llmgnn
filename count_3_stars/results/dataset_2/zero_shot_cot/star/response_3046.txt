Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star pattern. 
A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes that are connected to the central node. 

After analyzing the given edges, we can find the following 3-star patterns:
- Node 3 as the central node connected to nodes 1, 6, 8. (<3, (1, 6, 8)>)
- Node 6 as the central node connected to nodes 7, 9, 3. (<6, (7, 9, 3)>)
- Node 6 as the central node connected to nodes 0, 2, 8. (<6, (0, 2, 8)>)
- Node 9 as the central node connected to nodes 7, 3, 0. (<9, (7, 3, 0)>)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
