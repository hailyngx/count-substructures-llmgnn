Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (15, 7) (15, 9) (18, 3) (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 7) (23, 16) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 0) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (4, 8) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 20) (28, 6) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 25) (21, 0) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 20) (24, 17) (24, 1) (26, 12) (0, 8) (0, 21) (0, 29) (7, 15) (7, 23) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 7) (2, 27) (2, 20) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 24) (11, 25) (11, 29) (12, 28) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 9) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 12) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 13) (25, 11) (25, 19) (29, 0) (29, 11) (14, 28) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 19) (19, 17) (19, 25) (19, 27) (16, 23) (16, 8) (16, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors connected to them. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Nodes with 3 neighbors:  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 17, 5, and 18.  
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and does not have a third neighbor.  
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 22, and does not have a third neighbor.  
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 18, 23, and 10.  
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 22, 8, and 7.  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 23, 4, and 16.  
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 22, 17, and 7.  
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 24.  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 15, 23, and 10.  
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 6, 13, and 11.  

2. Counting the 3-stars:  
- <3, (17, 5, 18)>  
- <22, (18, 23, 10)>  
- <23, (22, 8, 7)>  
- <8, (23, 4, 16)>  
- <10, (22, 17, 7)>  

[The number of 3-stars in the graph is 5.]
