Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 0, and 2.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 9.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 9, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 2, and 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 12, and 2.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 14, and 6.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 10, 11, 8, 13, and 14.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 12, 0, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 3, 0, and 1.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 5, 3, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 13, and 1. (<4, (9, 13, 1)>)
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 6, and 9. (<10, (11, 6, 9)>)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 10, and 11. (<9, (4, 10, 11)>)
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 12. (<13, (4, 5, 12)>)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 12, and 2. (<5, (13, 12, 2)>)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 14, and 6. (<3, (2, 14, 6)>)
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 1, and 6. (<0, (7, 1, 6)>)

In total, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
