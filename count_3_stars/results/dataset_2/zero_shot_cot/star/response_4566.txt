Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their respective edges to find the 3-stars. 

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 3, 4, 8 (degree 4)
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 2, 5, 4 (degree 4)
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 1, 3, 5 (degree 5)
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 4 (degree 3)
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 8, 0 (degree 5)
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 6, 1, 8, 2 (degree 4)
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 5, 1, 7, 2 (degree 5)
- Node 7: Connected to node 6 (degree 1)
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 5, 0 (degree 4)
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 4, 2, 0 (degree 5)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 2, 5)>
<2, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<5, (6, 8, 2)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [6]
