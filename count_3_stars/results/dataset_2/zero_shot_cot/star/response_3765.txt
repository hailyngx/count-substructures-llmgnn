Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 23) (4, 29) (4, 17) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 29) (18, 3) (18, 22) (18, 27) (12, 24) (27, 18) (27, 23) (10, 26) (10, 16) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 7) (7, 17) (7, 13) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 20) (28, 11) (28, 9) (28, 25) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 13) (5, 23) (5, 25) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 26) (19, 11) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 6) (23, 4) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 19) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 21) (2, 15) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 6) (16, 10) (16, 21) (16, 0) (21, 8) (21, 16) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 14) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 2) (6, 1) (0, 22) (0, 16) (29, 4) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 25) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 9) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 24) (9, 28) (9, 14) (24, 12) (24, 20) (25, 28) (25, 5) (25, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 22, 16
- Node 1: 2, 6, 20, 14
- Node 2: 15, 22, 1, 6
- Node 3: 15, 14, 18
- Node 4: 23, 29, 17
- Node 5: 23, 25
- Node 6: 17, 19, 2, 1
- Node 7: 17, 13
- Node 8: 19, 29, 21
- Node 9: 28, 14
- Node 10: 26, 16
- Node 11: 28, 19, 20
- Node 12: 24
- Node 13: 15, 7, 26
- Node 14: 3, 15, 1, 9
- Node 15: 3, 26, 2, 13, 14
- Node 16: 10, 21, 0
- Node 17: 4, 6, 7
- Node 18: 22, 27, 3
- Node 19: 11, 23, 8, 6
- Node 20: 11, 1, 24
- Node 21: 16, 8
- Node 22: 18, 2, 0, 29
- Node 23: 4, 27, 5, 19
- Node 24: 12, 20
- Node 25: 5, 29, 28
- Node 26: 15, 10, 13
- Node 27: 18, 23
- Node 28: 11, 25, 9
- Node 29: 4, 22, 8, 25

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (14, 15, 18)>
<15, (2, 13, 14)>
<14, (1, 9, 15)>
<22, (0, 18, 29)>
<4, (17, 23, 29)>
<18, (3, 22, 27)>
<29, (8, 22, 25)>
