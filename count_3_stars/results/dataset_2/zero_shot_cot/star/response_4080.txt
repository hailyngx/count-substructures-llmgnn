Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

By examining each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 11, 12)>
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 8, 10)>
<3, (4, 8, -)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 13)>
<7, (5, 6, 10)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 7, 14)>
<10, (2, 7, 14)>
<11, (0, 7, -)>
<12, (0, 2, 6)>
<13, (1, 6, -)>
<14, (9, 10, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
