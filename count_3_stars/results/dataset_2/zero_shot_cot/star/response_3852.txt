Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, since those are potential central nodes of the 3-stars. 
From the list of edges, nodes 5, 4, 7, and 8 have degree 3.
Now, we will check the neighbors of these central nodes to see which combinations form 3-stars.

For central node 5:
- (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8)

For central node 4:
- (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 2)

For central node 7:
- (7, 4), (7, 6), (7 8)

For central node 8:
- (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 2)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<4, (9, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
