Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 11) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 18) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 12) (15, 4) (15, 6) (16, 14) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 19) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. The center node must have exactly three edges connected to it. From the given edges, the nodes that meet this criteria are: 1, 3, 6, 11, 12, and 16.

Next, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star.

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 10.
- There is a 3-star with center node 1: <1, (4, 3, 10)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 18.
- There is a 3-star with center node 3: <3, (1, 14, 18)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 15, and 13.
- There is a 3-star with center node 6: <6, (4, 15, 13)>.

For node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 7, 17, and 0.
- There is a 3-star with center node 11: <11, (7, 17, 0)>.

For node 12:
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 18, 13, and 19.
- There is a 3-star with center node 12: <12, (18, 13, 19)>.

For node 16:
- Node 16 does not have 3 edges connected to it, so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.
