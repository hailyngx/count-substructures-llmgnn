Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 14) (18, 13) (18, 8) (1, 15) (1, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 2) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 8) (13, 18) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 17) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, creating potential 3-stars.
Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 17, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 12, and a different node.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 19, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 17, 8, and a different node.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 17, and 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 18, 3, and 14.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- <6, (9, 17, 7)>
- <9, (6, 12, 17)>
- <15, (1, 19, 0)>
- <3, (17, 8, 11)>
- <11, (1, 17, 13)>
- <8, (18, 3, 14)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
