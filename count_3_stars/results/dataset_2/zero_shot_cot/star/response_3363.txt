Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 7) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Begin by identifying all nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 10, 12, 9, 13
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 8, 7, 9, 14
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 7, 6
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 8, 0, 6
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 8, 0
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 3, 0, 13
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 10, 12, 3, 9, 2
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 10, 11, 4, 2, 5, 12
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 11, 7, 2, 0, 14, 1
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 8, 7, 1
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 9, 13, 8, 12
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 11, 8, 7, 14, 1
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 11, 6, 14, 1
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 12, 2, 9, 13

2. Identify the 3-stars:
After identifying all nodes connected to each node, we can see that the following 3-stars exist in the graph:
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <1, (10, 12, 9)>
- <2, (8, 7, 9)>
- <3, (7, 6, 0)>
- <4, (8, 0, 6)>
- <5, (8, 0, 5)>
- <6, (4, 3, 13)>
- <7, (10, 12, 3)>
- <8, (10, 11, 12)>
- <9, (11, 1, 14)>
- <10, (8, 7, 1)>
- <11, (9, 13, 12)>
- <12, (11, 8, 7)>
- <13, (11, 1, 14)>
- <14, (12, 2, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
