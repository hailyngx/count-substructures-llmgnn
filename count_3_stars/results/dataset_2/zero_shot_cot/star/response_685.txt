Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 5) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 19) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 6) (5, 15) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 0) (6, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 9) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 14) (16, 8) (16, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<4, (10, 17, 18)>
<5, (15, 13, 11)>
<6, (0, 12, 7)>
<7, (2, 18, 6)>
<10, (1, 4, 13)>
<11, (5, 9, 8)>
<13, (16, 5, 10)>
<15, (3, 5, 18)>
<17, (19, 4, 19)>
<18, (3, 7, 18)>
<19, (17, 9, 14)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
