Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. 

The 3-star patterns in the graph are:
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 0, 1)>
<8, (6, 3, 1)>
<0, (6, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 6, 3)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
