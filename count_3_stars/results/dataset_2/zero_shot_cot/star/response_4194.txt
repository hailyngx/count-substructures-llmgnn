Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 9) (27, 13) (27, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 5) (3, 8) (7, 21) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 17) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 11) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 25) (11, 10) (11, 29) (11, 20) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 26) (28, 9) (29, 11) (29, 20) (29, 14) (13, 27) (13, 26) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 18) (26, 13) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 19) (20, 23) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 14) (12, 17) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 23) (22, 4) (22, 5) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 16) (14, 29) (14, 4) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 16) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 4) (23, 6) (23, 16) (24, 7) (24, 13) (9, 27) (9, 10) (9, 28) (9, 17) (17, 21) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 9) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 23) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<15, (27, 23, 2)>
<27, (15, 9, 13)>
<3, (25, 26, 5)>
<11, (25, 10, 29)>
<18, (1, 10, 2)>
<26, (3, 18, 13)>
<20, (11, 29, 19)>
<4, (22, 23, 14)>
<6, (1, 25, 23)>
<5, (3, 22, 16)>
<14, (29, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 14, 16)>
<19, (2, 13, 20)>
<23, (15, 20, 4)>
<24, (7, 13, 24)>
<9, (27, 10, 28)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [16].
