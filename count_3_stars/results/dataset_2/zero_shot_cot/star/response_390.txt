Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 0) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 19) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 7) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 10) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 11) (17, 5) (4, 2) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 17) (5, 1) (1, 12) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are directly connected to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 7, and 19.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
1. <6, (9, 14, 7)>
2. <6, (9, 14, 19)>
3. <9, (6, 15, 11)>
4. <9, (6, 13, 8)>
5. <8, (13, 19, 10)>
6. <8, (13, 7, 12)>
7. <13, (9, 15, 12)>
8. <13, (8, 15, 12)>
9. <2, (18, 4, 19)>
10. <2, (18, 0, 19)>
11. <18, (2, 10, 19)>
12. <18, (2, 0, 19)>
13. <7, (6, 12, 15)>
14. <12, (13, 1, 7)>
15. <3, (11, 14, 6)>
16. <11, (9, 3, 19)>
17. <0, (2, 7, 18)>
18. <10, (8, 15, 18)>
19. <15, (9, 10, 7)>
20. <19, (6, 18, 11)>
21. <19, (8, 18, 11)>
22. <19, (2, 18, 11)>
23. <19, (6, 9, 17)>
24. <19, (6, 14, 4)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars: [24].
