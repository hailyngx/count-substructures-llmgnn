Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 9) (27, 6) (6, 15) (6, 27) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 0) (8, 23) (8, 10) (8, 26) (13, 11) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 14) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 23) (14, 0) (14, 21) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 22) (26, 8) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 17) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 28) (4, 18) (4, 28) (4, 21) (4, 3) (18, 7) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 25) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 20) (16, 12) (16, 5) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 3) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 29) (29, 7) (29, 25) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 17) (11, 27) (11, 13) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 16) (19, 6) (19, 25) (19, 28) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 4) (28, 19) (21, 14) (21, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to three other nodes forming a 3-star structure.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 10.
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 28, and 21.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 22, and 16.
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 15, 27, and 9.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 29, and 28.
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 23, 26, and 10.
7. Node 17 is connected to nodes 26, 25, and 3.

Count of unique 3-stars: 7 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (9, 14, 10)>
<4, (18, 28, 21)>
<5, (1, 22, 16)>
<6, (15, 27, 9)>
<7, (12, 29, 28)>
<8, (23, 26, 10)>
<17, (26, 25, 3)>
