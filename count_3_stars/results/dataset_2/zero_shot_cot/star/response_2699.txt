Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 18) (15, 27) (15, 13) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 23) (27, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 20) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 29) (25, 13) (25, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 12) (23, 27) (4, 11) (4, 25) (4, 18) (8, 27) (8, 20) (1, 10) (1, 26) (26, 22) (26, 1) (26, 28) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 24) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 17) (28, 26) (28, 2) (28, 20) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 5) (21, 20) (21, 2) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 13) (7, 17) (2, 6) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 21) (20, 6) (20, 8) (20, 28) (20, 21) (24, 14) (24, 17) (29, 3) (29, 13) (13, 15) (13, 25) (13, 7) (13, 29) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 22) (12, 18) (17, 22) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that can be part of a 3-star. These are nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

The nodes that satisfy this condition are: 9, 27, 18, 13, 12, 2, 20, and 17.

Next, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star with exactly three leaves.

After analyzing the graph, we find the following 3-stars: 
<9, (11, 27, 6)>
<27, (15, 9, 23)>
<18, (16, 9, 4)>
<13, (15, 25, 7)>
<12, (15, 3, 22)>
<2, (6, 5, 28)>
<20, (6, 8, 21)>
<17, (22, 0, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
