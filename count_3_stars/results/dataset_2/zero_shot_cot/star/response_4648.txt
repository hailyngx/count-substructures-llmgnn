Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 3) (9, 13) (9, 26) (9, 15) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 18) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 6) (11, 19) (21, 13) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 4) (20, 21) (20, 29) (20, 18) (29, 20) (29, 7) (29, 25) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 24) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 8) (24, 23) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 1) (19, 11) (19, 25) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 15) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 27) (1, 12) (2, 1) (5, 25) (5, 4) (5, 28) (8, 0) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 27) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 8) (10, 3) (10, 7) (25, 29) (25, 19) (25, 5) (25, 28) (23, 24) (23, 28) (4, 0) (4, 21) (4, 5) (18, 17) (18, 20) (18, 12) (27, 1) (27, 8) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 23) (12, 21) (12, 1) (12, 18) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step.

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.
Nodes like 13, 22, 9, 26, 14, 17, 16, 24, 29, 7, 6, 1, 8, 15, 25, 4, 28, and 12 fall into this category.

2. For each of these nodes identified, check if the other nodes connected to them can form a 3-star.
   - For node 13: Nodes 22, 26, and 9 are connected, forming a 3-star. <13, (22, 26, 9)>
   - For node 22: Nodes 13, 26, and 3 are connected, forming a 3-star. <22, (13, 26, 3)>
   - For node 9: Nodes 13, 26, and 15 are connected, forming a 3-star. <9, (13, 26, 15)>
   - For node 26: Nodes 13, 22, and 9 are connected, forming a 3-star. <26, (13, 22, 9)>
   - For node 14: Not possible as it does not have exactly three edges.
   - For node 17: Not possible as it does not have exactly three edges.
   - For node 16: Nodes 13, 14, and 24 are connected, forming a 3-star. <16, (13, 14, 24)>
   - For node 24: Nodes 17, 16, and 8 are connected, forming a 3-star. <24, (17, 16, 8)>
   - For node 29: Nodes 20, 7, and 25 are connected, forming a 3-star. <29, (20, 7, 25)>
   - For node 7: Nodes 29, 10, and 1 are connected, forming a 3-star. <7, (29, 10, 1)>
   - For node 6: Nodes 14, 3, and 15 are connected, forming a 3-star. <6, (14, 3, 15)>
   - For node 1: Not possible as it does not have exactly three edges.
   - For node 8: Nodes 24, 0, and 15 are connected, forming a 3-star. <8, (24, 0, 15)>
   - For node 15: Not possible as it does not have exactly three edges.
   - For node 25: Nodes 29, 19, and 5 are connected, forming a 3-star. <25, (29, 19, 5)>
   - For node 4: Nodes 0, 21, and 5 are connected, forming a 3-star. <4, (0, 21, 5)>
   - For node 28: Not possible as it does not have exactly three edges.
   - For node 12: Not possible as it does not have exactly three edges.

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have:

[7] <13, (22, 26, 9)>, <22, (13, 26, 3)>, <9, (13, 26, 15)>, <26, (13, 22, 9)>, <16, (13, 14, 24)>, <24, (17, 16, 8)>, <29, (20, 7, 25)>
