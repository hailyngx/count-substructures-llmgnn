Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (9, 8, 4)>
2. <9, (5, 8, 1)>
3. <1, (9, 3, 0)>
4. <4, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <8, (9, 4, 3)>
6. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
7. <7, (5, 1, 3)>
8. <2, (9, 6, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
