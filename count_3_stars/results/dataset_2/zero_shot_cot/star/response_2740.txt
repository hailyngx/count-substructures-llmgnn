Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes with degrees:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 1
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
- For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Nodes 7 and 9 cannot be the centers as they do not have degree 3.
- Nodes 1 and 3 are connected to 3 other nodes each, making them potential centers.
- Let's check the connections of nodes 1 and 3 to find the 3-stars:
  
  - For Node 1:
    - (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 2) form a 3-star with Node 1 as the center: <1, (9, 3, 2)>
    
  - For Node 3:
    - (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1) form a 3-star with Node 3 as the center: <3, (9, 4, 1)>
    - (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 1) form another 3-star with Node 3 as the center: <3, (4, 7, 1)>
    
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
