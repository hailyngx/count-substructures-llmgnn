Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 8) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 19) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 19) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 18) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 15) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (9, 4) (9, 17) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 4) (17, 7) (17, 8) (17, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. From the list of edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<0, (14, 15, 3)>
<4, (9, 13, 10)>
<5, (18, 3, 10)>
<6, (1, 19, 18)>
<7, (12, 17, 10)>
<8, (1, 17, 12)>
<11, (13, 3, 11)>
<12, (7, 2, 8)>
<13, (11, 4, 7)>
<15, (0, 19, 18)>
<17, (7, 8, 9)>
<18, (15, 5, 6)>
<19, (15, 2, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
