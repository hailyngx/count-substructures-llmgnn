Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 21) (14, 11) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 10) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 27) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 26) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 0) (21, 26) (18, 0) (22, 16) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 19) (12, 28) (27, 17) (27, 8) (10, 17) (10, 23) (0, 21) (0, 18) (0, 8) (11, 14) (28, 3) (28, 12) (28, 1) (28, 5) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 20) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 24) (2, 9) (2, 6) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 20) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 6) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 13) (1, 28) (1, 24) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 16) (9, 2) (9, 23) (16, 22) (16, 20) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 9) (25, 14) (25, 29) (29, 3) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 4) (29, 25) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<3, (15, 28, 29)>
<15, (3, 19, 29)>
<14, (11, 25, 29)>
<17, (10, 5, 27)>
<7, (21, 19, 23)>
<21, (15, 7, 26)>
<28, (12, 1, 5)>
<26, (24, 7, 21)>
<1, (24, 4, 6)>
<8, (13, 27, 0)>
<20, (24, 5, 16)>
<2, (9, 6, 0)>
<5, (17, 28, 20)>
<4, (29, 6, 1)>
<19, (15, 7, 13)>
<6, (15, 2, 4)>
<9, (2, 23, 0)>
<16, (22, 20, 24)>
<23, (17, 7, 10)>
<25, (14, 29, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [20].
