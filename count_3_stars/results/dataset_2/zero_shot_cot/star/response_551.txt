Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (16, 2) (16, 14) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 18) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 18) (15, 6) (19, 7) (7, 19) (7, 13) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 12) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 4) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 18) (12, 11) (12, 14) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 3, 15)>
<9, (6, 4, 13)>
<10, (17, 14, 13)>
<17, (10, 1, 2)>
<2, (16, 17, 8)>
<8, (2, 1, 18)>
<3, (6, 13, 5)>
<1, (17, 8, 5)>
<15, (6, 18, 19)>
<19, (15, 7, 7)>
<7, (19, 13, 7)>
<14, (16, 10, 12)>
<4, (9, 3, 0)>
<0, (9, 2, 4)>
<5, (3, 1, 18)>
<11, (12, 14, 11)>
<12, (14, 16, 12)>
<18, (6, 8, 1)>
<13, (9, 10, 3)>

Since there are 19 unique 3-stars in the graph, the final answer is [19].
