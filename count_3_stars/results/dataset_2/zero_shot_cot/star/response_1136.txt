Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 26) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 17) (12, 13) (12, 28) (12, 26) (27, 23) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 8) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 22) (29, 4) (29, 0) (29, 23) (21, 2) (21, 6) (28, 12) (28, 0) (28, 19) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 20) (26, 10) (26, 12) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 6) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 20) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 15) (19, 28) (19, 15) (19, 1) (23, 27) (23, 29) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 16) (15, 4) (15, 25) (15, 19) (1, 2) (1, 19) (20, 13) (20, 6) (0, 29) (0, 28) (0, 6) (16, 13) (16, 25) (16, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 11
- Node 13
- Node 14
- Node 16
- Node 17
- Node 19
- Node 20
- Node 22
- Node 23
- Node 25
- Node 27
- Node 28
- Node 29

Next, we need to check if these nodes form 3-stars with their connected nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (6, 20, 28)>
<1, (2, 19, 21)>
<2, (1, 8, 18)>
<6, (0, 3, 20)>
<8, (2, 7, 18)>
<9, (5, 8, 17)>
<11, (3, 14, 17)>
<13, (12, 16, 26)>
<14, (4, 11, 16)>
<16, (13, 14, 25)>
<17, (9, 11, 22)>
<19, (1, 15, 28)>
<20, (6, 13, 21)>
<22, (17, 14, 2)>
<23, (27, 29, 8)>
<25, (16, 26, 15)>
<27, (23, 8, 13)>
<28, (20, 19, 0)>
<29, (23, 0, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [18]
