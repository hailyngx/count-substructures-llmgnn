Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 27) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 22) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 23) (12, 1) (12, 16) (2, 1) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 13) (19, 27) (26, 14) (26, 19) (26, 16) (18, 11) (18, 28) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 13) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 28) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 23) (15, 6) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 20) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 0) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 9) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 24) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 19) (24, 25) (24, 23) (24, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all possible 3-stars, which consist of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. If it is, then form a 3-star with the current node as the center and the three connected nodes as leaves.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<14, (17, 26, 6)>
<17, (14, 27, 1)>
<1, (3, 2, 12)>
<3, (1, 0, 19)>
<20, (25, 29, 5)>
<25, (20, 13, 24)>
<10, (11, 15, 6)>
<11, (10, 18, 4)>
<4, (22, 9, 15)>
<8, (22, 7, 23)>
<7, (8, 4, 23)>
<12, (1, 16, 1)>
<2, (1, 1, 1)>
<19, (3, 26, 13)>
<26, (14, 19, 16)>
<18, (11, 28, 1)>
<28, (18, 29, 13)>
<29, (14, 20, 28)>
<15, (10, 4, 23)>
<22, (4, 8, 16)>
<16, (10, 12, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 3)>
<5, (20, 3, 1)>
<6, (14, 10, 15)>
<23, (7, 15, 24)>
<9, (4, 16, 23)>
<13, (25, 19, 28)>
<27, (17, 1, 19)>
<24, (25, 23, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
