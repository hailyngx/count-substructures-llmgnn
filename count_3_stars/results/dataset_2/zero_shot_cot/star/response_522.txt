Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 1) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node to form a 3-star. A 3-star consists of the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the list of edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 1)>, <8, (9, 6, 3)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (1, 0, -)>

Please count the number of 3-stars and provide the final answer inside brackets.
