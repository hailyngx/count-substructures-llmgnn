Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 17) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 17) (0, 16) (0, 2) (8, 19) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 14) (16, 0) (16, 1) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (17, 5) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 12) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 16) (1, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 14) (10, 2) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 12) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the possible 3-stars.

The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 1
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 2
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4

Now, let's consider the nodes with degree 3 or higher as the potential center nodes for 3-stars. These are nodes 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 19.

Let's identify which nodes are connected to these center nodes and formulate the 3-stars:

1. Center node 3:
   - (3, 11, 13)
<3, (11, 13, 19)>

2. Center node 4:
   - (4, 7, 11)
   - (4, 7, 15)
   - (4, 7, 1)
   - (4, 7, 9)
   - (4, 1, 16)
   - (4, 1, 2)
   - (4, 1, 7)
   - (4, 11, 12)
<4, (7, 11, 15)>

3. Center node 6:
   - (6, 5, 15)
   - (6, 5, 17)
   - (6, 5, 13)
   - (6, 13, 9)
<6, (5, 13, 9)>

4. Center node 7:
   - (7, 4, 1)
   - (7, 1, 16)
   - (7, 1, 4)
   - (7, 1, 2)
   - (7, 9, 13)
<7, (1, 4, 16)>

5. Center node 8:
   - (8, 18, 19)
   - (8, 18, 12)
<8, (18, 19, 12)>

6. Center node 9:
   - (9, 7, 13)
   - (9, 13, 6)
<9, (7, 13, 6)>

7. Center node 11:
   - (11, 3, 13)
   - (11, 3, 17)
   - (11, 3, 12)
   - (11, 4, 7)
   - (11, 4, 17)
<11, (3, 13, 17)>

8. Center node 12:
   - (12, 11, 17)
   - (12, 11, 18)
   - (12, 17, 19)
<12, (11, 17, 18)>

9. Center node 13:
   - (13, 9, 6)
   - (13, 9, 3)
   - (13, 6, 5)
<13, (9, 6, 5)>

10. Center node 15:
   - (15, 4, 6)
   - (15, 4, 7)
   - (15, 4, 2)
   - (15, 6, 13)
<15, (4, 6, 7)>

11. Center node 17:
   - (17, 5, 11)
   - (17, 5, 12)
   - (17, 5, 19)
   - (17, 11, 4)
   - (17, 11, 12)
<17, (5, 11, 12)>

12. Center node 19:
   - (19, 3, 8)
   - (19, 3, 17)
   - (19, 3, 14)
   - (19, 8, 18)
<19, (3, 8, 18)>

So, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
