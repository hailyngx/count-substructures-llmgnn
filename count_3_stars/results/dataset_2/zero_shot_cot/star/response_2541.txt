Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (15, 18) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 5) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 2) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 8) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 2) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 13) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Determine the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: {16, 5, 19}
- Node 1: {11, 14, 9, 18}
- Node 2: {4, 19, 13}
- Node 3: {17}
- Node 4: {12, 9, 2}
- Node 5: {0, 16, 14}
- Node 6: {17, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {6, 14}
- Node 8: {10, 12, 18, 6}
- Node 9: {17, 1, 4, 18, 13}
- Node 10: {17, 8}
- Node 11: {1, 18, 13}
- Node 12: {4, 8, 19}
- Node 13: {9, 11, 2}
- Node 14: {7, 1, 5}
- Node 15: {18}
- Node 16: {0, 5}
- Node 17: {3, 10, 6, 9}
- Node 18: {15, 1, 9, 11, 8}
- Node 19: {12, 0, 2}

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- <3, (17, 10, 6)>
- <7, (6, 17, 14)>
- <12, (4, 8, 19)>
- <2, (4, 19, 13)>
- <5, (0, 16, 14)>
- <14, (1, 7, 5)>
- <15, (18)>
- <16, (0, 5, 19)>
- <18, (1, 9, 11)>
- <19, (0, 2, 12)>
- <0, (16, 5, 19)>
- <1, (9, 14, 18)>
- <4, (2, 12, 9)>
- <6, (7, 8, 17)>
- <8, (6, 10, 12)>
- <9, (1, 4, 13)>
- <10, (8, 17, 6)>
- <11, (1, 13, 18)>
- <13, (2, 9, 11)>
