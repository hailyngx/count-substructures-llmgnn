Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 4, node 7, and node 8 since these nodes can potentially form 3-star graphs. Then we'll count the number of 3-stars formed by these connections.

For node 4:
- Connected to: 7, 8, 0

For node 7:
- Connected to: 4, 3, 1, 8

For node 8:
- Connected to: 4, 7, 1, 3, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
1. From node 4: <4, (7, 8, 0)>
2. From node 7: <7, (4, 1, 8)>
3. From node 8: <8, (4, 7, 1)> and <8, (4, 3, 6)>

So, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
