Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are the potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes and their degrees are:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 7
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 7
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 7
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4

Nodes 1, 3, 9, 11, 13, and 14 have a degree of 3 and can be potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Let's check for each potential central node:

For Node 1: <1, (4, 10, 14)> (1 potential 3-star)
For Node 3: <3, (5, 6, 12)> (1 potential 3-star)
For Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 13)> (1 potential 3-star)
For Node 11: <11, (2, 6, 14)> (1 potential 3-star)
For Node 13: <13, (4, 5, 6)> (1 potential 3-star)
For Node 14: <14, (1, 5, 11)> (1 potential 3-star)

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
<1, (4, 10, 14)>, <3, (5, 6, 12)>, <9, (0, 2, 13)>, <11, (2, 6, 14)>, <13, (4, 5, 6)>, <14, (1, 5, 11)>
