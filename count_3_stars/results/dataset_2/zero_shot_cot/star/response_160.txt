Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 3.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 5.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 6.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 3.
   
2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
   - <4, (7, 9, 3)>
   - <7, (4, 0, 9)>
   - <6, (3, 9, 5)>
   - <1, (2, 5, 8)>
   - <2, (1, 6, 8)>
   - <5, (7, 1, 6)>
   - <8, (7, 1, 3)>
   
There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
