Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 22) (9, 2) (9, 20) (9, 23) (0, 28) (0, 21) (27, 14) (27, 11) (27, 20) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 6) (4, 1) (18, 24) (21, 0) (21, 17) (28, 0) (28, 2) (24, 18) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 8) (26, 24) (26, 16) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 13) (11, 27) (11, 22) (11, 25) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 23) (20, 9) (20, 27) (20, 29) (12, 16) (12, 25) (12, 22) (12, 15) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 12) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 15) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 2) (6, 29) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 22) (22, 5) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 14) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 15) (2, 25) (8, 24) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 6) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 1) (25, 11) (25, 12) (25, 2) (25, 23) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 23) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph by identifying nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star graph. 

Starting with the central nodes, we find that the nodes with edges meeting exactly three other nodes are 17, 3, 16, 7, 12, 24, and 6. 

Next, we identify the leaves that are connected to each central node:
- For central node 17: (10, 29, 21)
- For central node 3: (24, 16, 13)
- For central node 16: (17, 26, 12)
- For central node 7: (10, 19, 15)
- For central node 12: (16, 25, 15)
- For central node 24: (18, 26, 8)
- For central node 6: (29, 14, 8)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <17, (10, 29, 21)>
- <3, (24, 16, 13)>
- <16, (17, 26, 12)>
- <7, (10, 19, 15)>
- <12, (16, 25, 15)>
- <24, (18, 26, 8)>
- <6, (29, 14, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
