Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 7) (2, 18) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 1) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 4) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 16) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 16) (17, 13) (17, 16) (4, 1) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 19) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 17) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 12) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) (6, 3) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each node with exactly three neighbors (leaves) connected by edges. Let's list all the 3-stars found in this graph:

<0, (7, 15, 18)>
<1, (5, 14, 18)>
<2, (15, 18, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 11)>
<4, (1, 12, 14)>
<5, (9, 3, 1)>
<7, (9, 18, 0)>
<8, (3, 11, 7)>
<9, (5, 16, 7)>
<10, (19, 13, 16)>
<11, (3, 19, 8)>
<12, (4, 14, 19)>
<13, (10, 17, 16)>
<14, (1, 18, 12)>
<15, (2, 0, 1)>
<16, (9, 13, 17)>
<17, (13, 16)>
<18, (2, 1, 7)>
<19, (11, 12, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
