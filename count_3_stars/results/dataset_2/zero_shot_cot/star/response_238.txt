Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (12, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph:

By examining the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <10, (11, 6, 7)>
2. <11, (10, 3, 14)>
3. <4, (11, 8, 6)>
4. <8, (4, 5, 12)>
5. <7, (10, 5, 0)>
6. <12, (8, 1, 13)>
7. <3, (11, 14, 5)>
8. <14, (11, 3, 13)>
9. <1, (11, 8, 9)>
10. <5, (10, 8, 7)>
11. <6, (10, 4, 2)>
12. <9, (10, 1, 13)>
13. <2, (4, 14, 6)>
14. <0, (11, 8, 1)>
15. <13, (10, 14, 0)>

Thus, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
