Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 11) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (4, 8, 12)>
<2, (3, 6, 11)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 10, 13)>
<5, (6, 13, 14)>
<6, (2, 5, 10)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<10, (4, 6, 14)>
<11, (1, 2, 13)>
<12, (0, 1, 14)>
<13, (4, 11, 12)>
<14, (5, 9, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph, which is the number of unique 3-stars listed above. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [13].
