Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<9, (11, 0, 13)>
<1, (3, 14, 7)>
<3, (1, 11, 4)>
<5, (6, 8, 10)>
<11, (9, 3, 13)>
<13, (11, 0, 10)>
<7, (6, 1, 8)>
<14, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (6, 5, 7)>
<12, (3, 8, 10)>
<10, (5, 8, 12)>
<2, (6, 11, 4)>
<0, (9, 11, 13)>
<4, (6, 1, 3)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars inside brackets [].
