Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given graph, the nodes that fit this description are: 5, 9, 4, 8, 6, 2, 0, and 3.

Now, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<5, (4, 3, 6)>
<9, (8, 2, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
<6, (5, 3, 1)>
<2, (9, 8, 3)>
<0, (6, 2, 1)>
<3, (5, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
