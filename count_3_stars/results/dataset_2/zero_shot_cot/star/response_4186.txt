Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes connected to each node in question:

Node 0: 5, 9, 1, 8
Node 1: 9, 4, 3, 2, 0
Node 2: 9, 7, 1, 3, 6
Node 3: 1, 2, 8
Node 4: 7, 8, 1, 6
Node 5: 9, 0
Node 6: 4, 8, 2
Node 7: 9, 4, 2
Node 8: 9, 4, 3, 6, 0
Node 9: 5, 9, 8, 2, 1, 7, 0

Now we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 1)> - One 3-star
<1, (9, 4, 2)> - One 3-star
<2, (9, 7, 1)> - One 3-star
<3, (1, 2, 8)> - One 3-star
<4, (7, 9, 8)> - One 3-star
<5, (9, 0, 5)> - One 3-star
<6, (4, 8, 6)> - One 3-star
<7, (9, 7, 4)> - One 3-star
<8, (9, 0, 8)> - One 3-star
<9, (9, 8, 1)> - One 3-star

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]
