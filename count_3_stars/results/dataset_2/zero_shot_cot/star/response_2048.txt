Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 4) (5, 11) (6, 18) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 19) (8, 15) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 15) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 9) (1, 2) (1, 14) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

Using this information, we can identify the nodes in the graph that form 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 11), (0, 2), (0, 14), (0, 15), (0, 12)
- Node 4: (4, 10), (4, 17)
- Node 9: (9, 14), (9, 16), (9, 3), (9, 7)
- Node 13: (13, 10), (13, 11), (13, 17), (13, 15)

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 2, and 14: <0, (11, 2, 14)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 17, and 4: <4, (10, 17, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 16, and 3: <9, (14, 16, 3)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 17: <13, (10, 11, 17)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
