Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (8, 0, 3)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 2, 3)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 2)>
4. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 4, 7)>
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (5, 9, 6)>
6. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (6, 1, 0)>
7. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 8)>
8. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 7, -not possible, as only 2 connections are present for node 8)>
9. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 6, 3)>
10. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 4, 2)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
So, the final answer is [9].
