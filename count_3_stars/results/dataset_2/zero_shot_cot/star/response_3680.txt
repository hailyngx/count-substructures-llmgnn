Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 2)>
<2, (7, 8, 5)>
<8, (2, 9, 10)>
<5, (7, 2, 13)>
<13, (4, 2, 10)>
<0, (7, 2, 6)>
<9, (8, 10, 3)>
<10, (8, 13, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<11, (1, 6, 12)>
<3, (9, 14, 12)>
<14, (10, 3, 6)>
<6, (4, 13, 0)>
<12, (9, 11, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
