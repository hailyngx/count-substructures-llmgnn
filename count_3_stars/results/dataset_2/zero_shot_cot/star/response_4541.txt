Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes from the given edges: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}.

Next, let's count the 3-stars in the graph.
We know that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Thus, to count the number of 3-stars, we look for nodes with three edges connected to them.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars:
<0, (7, 5, 8)>
<1, (9, 6, 2)>
<2, (1, 6, 3)>
<3, (11, 6, 14)>
<4, (7, 9, 10)>
<5, (0, 8, 10)>
<6, (1, 3, 14)>
<7, (0, 4, 12)>
<8, (0, 5, 1)>
<9, (1, 4, 13)>
<10, (4, 5, 12)>
<11, (3, 10, 6)>
<12, (4, 7, 10)>
<13, (9, 0, 7)>
<14, (3, 6, 14)>

Now we count the unique 3-stars: {<0, (7, 5, 8)>, <1, (9, 6, 2)>, <2, (1, 6, 3)>, <3, (11, 6, 14)>, <4, (7, 9, 10)>, <5, (0, 8, 10)>, <6, (1, 3, 14)>, <7, (0, 4, 12)>, <9, (1, 4, 13)>, <10, (4, 5, 12)>, <11, (3, 10, 6)>, <13, (9, 0, 7)>}.

Finally, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
