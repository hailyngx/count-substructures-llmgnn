Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (12, 3) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star graphs. 

From the given edges, the nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 11, and 12.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, 8, 11, and 13.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, and 14.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, 9, 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 9, 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 13, 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 11, 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 3.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, 10.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 10, 11, 14.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

There are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
