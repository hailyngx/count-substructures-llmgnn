Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the possible 3-stars we can find in the graph:
<5, (8, 3, 7)>
<9, (11, 10, 12)>
<10, (9, 0, 3)>
<11, (9, 6, -)>
<8, (5, 13, 12)>
<13, (8, 12, 4)>
<7, (5, 13, 14)>
<12, (9, 8, 13)>
<2, (7, 1, 4)>
<3, (5, 10, 0)>
<4, (13, 12, 2)>
<0, (10, 3, 1)>
<6, (11, 12, 3)>
<14, (10, 13, 7)>
<1, (9, 13, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
