Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 1, 13)>
<8, (13, 4, 7)>
