Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to find the 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 10.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 10, and 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 10, and 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 8.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 11, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 2.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 13.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4 and 11.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 0.

Step 2: Construct the 3-stars using the identified nodes.
- <9, (2, 11, 10)>
- <4, (0, 10, 14)>
- <7, (6, 10, 2)>
- <12, (13, 11, 8)>
- <13, (4, 12, 11)>
- <1, (6, 11, 0)>
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>
- <0, (4, 10, 2)>
- <10, (9, 4, 7)>
- <11, (9, 12, 13)>
- <14, (4, 11)>
- <8, (5, 12, 3)>
- <3, (9, 6, 8)>
- <2, (9, 7, 0)>

Count the number of 3-stars:
[14]
