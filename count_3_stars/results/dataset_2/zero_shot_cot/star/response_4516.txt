Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 3: (3, 1, 2, 8) <3, (1, 2, 8)>
2. Node 4: (4, 5, 0, 8) <4, (5, 0, 8)>
3. Node 5: (5, 9, 6, 4) <5, (9, 6, 4)>
4. Node 6: (6, 5, 3, 7) <6, (5, 3, 7)>
5. Node 7: (7, 1, 3, 6) <7, (1, 3, 6)>
6. Node 8: (8, 9, 1, 4) <8, (9, 1, 4)>
7. Node 9: (9, 5, 8, 2) <9, (5, 8, 2)>
8. Node 2: (2, 9, 1, 3) <2, (9, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
