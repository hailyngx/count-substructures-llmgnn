Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 11) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 7) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 11) (15, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (1, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 
The nodes with degree 3 are: 5, 9, 18, 6, 8, 0, 3, 7, 11, 4, 12, 19.

Next, for each node with degree 3, we will check if the connected nodes form a 3-star with it. 
<5, (6, 15, 9)>
<9, (5, 19, 3)>
<18, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 18, 11)>
<8, (2, 3, 12)>
<0, (14, 4, 7)>
<3, (8, 11, 19)>
<7, (14, 18, 15)>
<11, (17, 15, 6)>
<4, (0, 19, 6)>
<12, (17, 8, 13)>
<19, (9, 4, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
