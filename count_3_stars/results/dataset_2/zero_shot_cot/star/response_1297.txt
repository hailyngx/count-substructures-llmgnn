Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (7, 10) (8, 4) (8, 0) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 0) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 12) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (12, 19) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
We need to find 3-stars in this graph. Let's start by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We have the following candidates for the center of a 3-star: 

- Node 3: Connected to nodes 11, 15, and 4
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 3, 8, and 18
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 16, 10, and 17
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 4, 18, and 2
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 3, 10, and 6
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 9
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 11, 4, and 14
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 11, 5, and 12

Let's count the number of unique 3-stars using these centers:
- <3, (11, 15, 4)>
- <4, (3, 8, 18)>
- <9, (16, 10, 17)>
- <14, (4, 18, 2)>
- <15, (3, 10, 6)>
- <16, (0, 3, 9)>
- <18, (11, 4, 14)>
- <19, (11, 5, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
