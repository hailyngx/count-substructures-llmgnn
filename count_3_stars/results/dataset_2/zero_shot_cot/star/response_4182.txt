Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 8, 7)>
<7, (6, 4, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<2, (4, 8, 0)>
<0, (9, 8, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, _)>

Total number of 3-stars: [10].
