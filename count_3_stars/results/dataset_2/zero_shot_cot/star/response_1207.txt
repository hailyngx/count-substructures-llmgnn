Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 13) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 3) (19, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 18) (6, 14) (6, 16) (6, 8) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 18) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 0: 9, 12
Node 1: 10, 13, 18
Node 2: 5, 12, 15, 17, 19
Node 3: 10, 18, 19
Node 4: 7, 16
Node 5: 2, 7, 16
Node 6: 8, 14, 16
Node 7: 4, 5, 13
Node 8: 6, 10, 18
Node 9: 0, 10, 11
Node 10: 1, 3, 8, 9
Node 11: 9, 13
Node 12: 0, 2, 15, 16
Node 13: 1, 7, 11
Node 14: 6, 17
Node 15: 2, 12
Node 16: 4, 5, 6, 12
Node 17: 2, 14, 18
Node 18: 1, 3, 8, 17
Node 19: 2, 3
