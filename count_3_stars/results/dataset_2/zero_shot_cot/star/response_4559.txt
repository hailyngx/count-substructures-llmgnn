Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges incident to them since those nodes can be centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3: 
- Node 3

Next, for each node with degree 3, let's list the 3-stars they are part of.

For node 3:
<3, (13, 12, 14)>
<3, (13, 2, 4)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
