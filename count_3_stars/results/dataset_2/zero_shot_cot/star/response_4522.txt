Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (9, 7, 5)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 8, 5)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<5, (7, 3, 0)>
<6, (8, 7, 0)>
<7, (6, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 9, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
