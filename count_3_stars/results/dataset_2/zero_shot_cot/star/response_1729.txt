Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (0, 17) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 1) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 17
- Node 1: 9, 12, 13, 14
- Node 2: 8, 11, 14, 18
- Node 3: 6, 7, 8, 14
- Node 4: 10, 11, 16, 19
- Node 5: 13, 15, 17, 19
- Node 6: 3, 10
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 2, 3, 18
- Node 9: 1, 15
- Node 10: 4, 6
- Node 11: 2, 4, 19
- Node 12: 1, 13
- Node 13: 1, 5, 12, 16, 19
- Node 14: 1, 2, 3, 18
- Node 15: 5, 9, 16
- Node 16: 4, 13, 15
- Node 17: 0, 5
- Node 18: 2, 8, 14
- Node 19: 4, 5, 11, 13

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 is the center of the 3-star <1, (9, 12, 14)>.
- Node 2 is the center of the 3-star <2, (8, 11, 18)>.
- Node 3 is the center of the 3-star <3, (6, 7, 8)>.
- Node 4 is the center of the 3-star <4, (10, 11, 16)>.
- Node 5 is the center of the 3-star <5, (13, 15, 17)>.
- Node 6 is not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 7 is not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 8 is the center of the 3-star <8, (2, 3, 18)>.
- Node 9 is the center of the 3-star <9, (1, 15, 12)>.
- Node 10 is not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 11 is the center of the 3-star <11, (2, 4, 19)>.
- Node 12 is not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 13 is the center of the 3-star <13, (1, 5, 16)>.
- Node 14 is the center of the 3-star <14, (1, 3, 18)>.
- Node 15 is not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 16 is not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 17 is not the center of a 3-star.
- Node 18 is the center of the 3-star <18, (2, 8, 14)>.
- Node 19 is not the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, there are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph: <1, (9, 12, 14)>, <2, (8, 11, 18)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (10, 11, 16)>, <5, (13, 15, 17)>, and <8, (2, 3, 18)>.
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
