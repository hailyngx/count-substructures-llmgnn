Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given network:
1. <3, (2, 6, 10)>
2. <4, (5, 9, 1)>
3. <8, (2, 4, 13)>
4. <11, (2, 8, 14)>
5. <12, (1, 10, 15)>

So, there are [5] 3-stars in the graph.
