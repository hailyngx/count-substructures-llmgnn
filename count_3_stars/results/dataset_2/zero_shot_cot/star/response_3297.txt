Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (19, 8) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (4, 16) (4, 1) (4, 15) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. Node 1: (1, 3, 4)
2. Node 2: (2, 3, 9)
3. Node 3: (3, 1, 9)
4. Node 4: (4, 1, 15)
5. Node 6: (6, 16, 8)
6. Node 8: (8, 3, 9)
7. Node 9: (9, 3, 8)
8. Node 10: (10, 0, 1)
9. Node 11: (11, 16, 17)
10. Node 14: (14, 13, 17)
11. Node 15: (15, 16, 17)
12. Node 16: (16, 6, 15)
13. Node 17: (17, 11, 15)
14. Node 18: (18, 5, 14)

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [14].
