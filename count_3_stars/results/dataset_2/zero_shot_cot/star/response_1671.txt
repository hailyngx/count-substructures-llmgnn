Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 1) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (11, 5, 9)>
<1, (11, 7, 9)>
<2, (13, 10, 5)>
<3, (8, 11, 5)>
<4, (10, 5, 3)>
<5, (13, 4, 7)>
<6, (11, 7, 12)>
<7, (12, 1, 6)>
<8, (13, 3, 5)>
<9, (13, 10, 1)>
<10, (4, 2, 9)>
<11, (3, 1, 6)>
<12, (7, 6, 14)>
<13, (9, 2, 5)>
<14, (12, 0, 9)>

There are a total of 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [14].
