Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, we calculate the degree of each node in the graph:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4

Next, we identify 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars:
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <8, (0, 4, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 3)>

So, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
