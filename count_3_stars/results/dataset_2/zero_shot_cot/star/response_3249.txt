Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
<11, (6, 3, 13)>
<12, (9, 8, 0)>
