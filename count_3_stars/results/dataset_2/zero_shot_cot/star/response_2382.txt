Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 14) 

Response:
Let's go through each node one by one to identify the 3-stars present in the graph:

1. Node 0:
   - 3-star: <0, (1, 11, 5)>

2. Node 1:
   - 3-star: <1, (3, 11, 5)>

3. Node 2:
   - 3-star: <2, (10, 11, 9)>

4. Node 3:
   - No 3-star with 3 as the center node.

5. Node 4:
   - 3-star: <4, (7, 8, 12)>

6. Node 5:
   - 3-star: <5, (1, 10, 14)>

7. Node 6:
   - No 3-star with 6 as the center node.

8. Node 7:
   - No 3-star with 7 as the center node.

9. Node 8:
   - No 3-star with 8 as the center node.

10. Node 9:
    - No 3-star with 9 as the center node.

11. Node 10:
    - No 3-star with 10 as the center node.

12. Node 11:
    - No 3-star with 11 as the center node.

13. Node 12:
    - 3-star: <12, (4, 2, 13)>

14. Node 13:
    - No 3-star with 13 as the center node.

15. Node 14:
    - No 3-star with 14 as the center node.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have found 5 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [5].
