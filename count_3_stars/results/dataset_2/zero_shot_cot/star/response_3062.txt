Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 7) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (2, 0) (2, 19) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 14) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 2) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 3
- Node 1: degree = 4
- Node 2: degree = 2
- Node 3: degree = 3
- Node 4: degree = 2
- Node 5: degree = 3
- Node 6: degree = 3
- Node 7: degree = 3
- Node 8: degree = 5
- Node 9: degree = 4
- Node 10: degree = 2
- Node 11: degree = 4
- Node 12: degree = 2
- Node 13: degree = 3
- Node 14: degree = 3
- Node 15: degree = 4
- Node 16: degree = 3
- Node 17: degree = 3
- Node 18: degree = 4
- Node 19: degree = 1

2. Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- There are no 3-stars in this graph as each node has a degree less than 3.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
