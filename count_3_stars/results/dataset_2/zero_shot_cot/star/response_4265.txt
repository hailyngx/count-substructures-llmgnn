Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 19) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 10) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (5, 8) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 13) (11, 1) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 16) (14, 3) (16, 9) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 10) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 15) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Firstly, let's look at each node and its neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to 4, 6, 15.
- Node 1 is connected to 7, 10, 11.
- Node 2 is connected to 0, 18.
- Node 3 is connected to 14, 16, 19.
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 15, 17.
- Node 5 is connected to 8.
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 9, 18.
- Node 7 is connected to 1, 13.
- Node 8 is connected to 5, 9, 19.
- Node 9 is connected to 6, 8, 16, 17, 18, 19.
- Node 10 is connected to 1, 12, 16.
- Node 11 is connected to 1.
- Node 12 is connected to 10.
- Node 13 is connected to 7, 18, 19.
- Node 14 is connected to 3.
- Node 15 is connected to 0, 4, 18.
- Node 16 is connected to 3, 9, 10, 17.
- Node 17 is connected to 4, 9, 16, 18.
- Node 18 is connected to 2, 6, 13, 15, 17.
- Node 19 is connected to 1, 3, 8, 9, 13.

Now let's find all 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 15)>
<1, (7, 10, 11)>
<3, (14, 16, 19)>
<4, (0, 15, 17)>
<6, (0, 9, 18)>
<15, (0, 4, 18)>
<18, (2, 6, 13)>
<19, (8, 9, 13)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [8].
