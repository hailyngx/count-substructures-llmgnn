Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (18, 9) (18, 12) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 13) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 19) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 10) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as they can potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with degree 3: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16

Next, we will check each of these nodes and their neighbors to see if they form a 3-star.

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 4, 5, 10, 16, 19
<3, (4, 5, 19)>

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 3, 11, 16, 19
<5, (3, 11, 16)>

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 10, 16
<6, (1, 2, 16)>
<6, (1, 10, 16)>

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 2, 8, 17, 18
<9, (2, 8, 17)>

For node 10:
- Neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 15
<10, (3, 4, 15)>
<10, (3, 6, 15)>

For node 12:
- Neighbors: 1, 4, 18
<12, (1, 4, 18)>

For node 15:
- Neighbors: 8, 10, 14, 16
<15, (8, 10, 16)>

For node 16:
- Neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 15
<16, (3, 5, 15)>
<16, (3, 6, 15)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in this graph.
