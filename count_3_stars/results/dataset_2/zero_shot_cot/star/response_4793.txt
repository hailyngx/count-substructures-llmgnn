Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 4) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 12) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 18) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 4) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (18, 9) (18, 15) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 15) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this graph. Let's count them step-by-step.

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star: (1, (3, 11, 13))
2. Node 3 forms a 3-star: (3, (1, 9, 11))
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star: (4, (2, 6, 10))
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star: (5, (0, 14, 15))
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star: (7, (8, 16, 17))
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star: (9, (3, 10, 18))
7. Node 13 forms a 3-star: (13, (1, 11, 0))
8. Node 15 forms a 3-star: (15, (2, 18, 19))
9. Node 17 forms a 3-star: (17, (10, 11, 19))
