Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 28) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 16) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 28) (22, 7) (23, 10) (23, 26) (23, 1) (23, 27) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 13) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 16) (27, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 25) (18, 26) (18, 16) (18, 29) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 19) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 14) (21, 7) (21, 26) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 17) (29, 9) (29, 18) (29, 19) (29, 0) (8, 15) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 2) (19, 20) (19, 29) (19, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 29) (0, 13) (17, 3) (17, 26) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 24) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 20) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (24, 7) (24, 13) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (25, 2) (25, 28) (16, 6) (16, 27) (16, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the central node and its connected leaves for each possible 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (6, 10, 13)>
<1, (9, 20, 23)>
<2, (3, 4, 19)>
<4, (2, 12, 14)>
<5, (15, 28, 40)>
<6, (0, 9, 16)>
<7, (14, 21, 24)>
<8, (15, 19, 27)>
<10, (0, 10, 28)>
<12, (4, 13, 27)>
<13, (0, 12, 24)>
<14, (4, 7, 8)>
<15, (5, 8, 20)>
<16, (6, 18, 27)>
<17, (3, 26, 40)>
<18, (16, 26, 29)>
<19, (2, 8, 29)>
<20, (1, 15, 19)>
<21, (7, 26, 28)>
<22, (7, 21, 26)>
<23, (1, 10, 27)>
<24, (7, 13, 31)>
<25, (2, 18, 28)>
<26, (7, 17, 18)>
<27, (8, 12, 16)>
<28, (5, 10, 25)>
<29, (9, 18, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].
