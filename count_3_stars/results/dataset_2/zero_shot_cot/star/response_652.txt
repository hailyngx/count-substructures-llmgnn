Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (2, 1, 8)>
2. <9, (2, 3, 7)>
3. <6, (7, 2, 4)>
4. <4, (6, 8, 0)>
5. <7, (9, 6, 3)>
6. <1, (5, 7, 3)>
7. <3, (9, 4, 8)>
8. <8, (5, 4, 1)>
9. <2, (5, 9, 6)>
10. <0, (5, 6, 4)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [10].
