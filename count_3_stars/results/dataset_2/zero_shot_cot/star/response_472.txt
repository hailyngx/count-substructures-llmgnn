Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 0) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 29) (9, 15) (1, 11) (1, 21) (1, 6) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 13) (15, 9) (15, 3) (15, 13) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 2) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 28) (7, 20) (19, 8) (19, 22) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 27) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 25) (6, 2) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 22) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 20) (22, 29) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 17) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 4) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 13) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 23) (14, 28) (14, 4) (14, 13) (27, 3) (27, 8) (27, 17) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 4) (24, 4) (24, 13) (24, 18) (4, 17) (4, 23) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 24) (29, 5) (29, 22) (29, 25) (2, 28) (2, 6) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 23) (13, 14) (13, 24) (18, 21) (18, 0) (18, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we will determine the unique 3-stars from these instances. 

Let's start by finding all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 16, 11, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 16, 19, and 27.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 21, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 17, 14, 25, and 23 (connected to four nodes).
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 16, 29, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 28, 20, and not further connected.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 21, 12, and 22.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 16, 10, and 17.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 14, 24, 23, and 3 (connected to four nodes).
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 13, 28, and 4.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 13.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 6, 12, and 4.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 21, 0, and 24.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 7, 22, and 23.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 19, 10, and 20.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 20, 13, and 4.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 6, 29, and 4.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 17.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 5, 22, and 25.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (16, 11, 18)>
<1, (11, 21, 6)>
<5, (16, 29, 0)>
<10, (21, 12, 22)>
<12, (16, 10, 17)>
<14, (13, 28, 4)>
<20, (7, 22, 23)>
<27, (3, 8, 17)>
<29, (5, 22, 25)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
