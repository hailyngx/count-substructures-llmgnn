Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars.
1. Node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 28), (1, 7), (1, 12), (1, 27). No 3-star can be formed with Node 1 as the center.
2. Node 3 has 3 edges: (3, 25), (3, 0), (3, 16). No 3-star can be formed with Node 3 as the center.
3. Node 25 has 4 edges: (25, 3), (25, 5), (25, 6), (25, 22). No 3-star can be formed with Node 25 as the center.
4. Node 8 has 2 edges: (8, 23), (8, 21). No 3-star can be formed with Node 8 as the center.
5. Node 23 has 5 edges: (23, 8), (23, 11), (23, 18), (23, 10). Two possible 3-stars with Node 23 as the center are <23, (8, 11, 18)> and <23, (8, 10, 18)>.
6. Node 28 has 2 edges: (28, 17), (28, 1). No 3-star can be formed with Node 28 as the center.
7. Node 29 has 2 edges: (29, 5), (29, 24). No 3-star can be formed with Node 29 as the center.
8. Node 13 has 3 edges: (13, 14), (13, 12), (13, 27). No 3-star can be formed with Node 13 as the center.
9. Node 11 has 5 edges: (11, 23), (11, 22), (11, 19), (11, 18), (11, 2). One possible 3-star with Node 11 as the center is <11, (23, 22, 19)>.
10. Node 19 has 4 edges: (19, 11), (19, 4), (19, 20), (19, 9). No 3-star can be formed with Node 19 as the center.
11. Node 27 has 2 edges: (27, 1), (27, 13). No 3-star can be formed with Node 27 as the center.
12. Node 7 has 3 edges: (7, 1), (7, 16), (7, 5). No 3-star can be formed with Node 7 as the center.

14. Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 19), (4, 10), (4, 2). No 3-star can be formed with Node 4 as the center.
15. Node 6 has 3 edges: (6, 14), (6, 25), (6, 18). No 3-star can be formed with Node 6 as the center.
16. Node 24 has 2 edges: (24, 29), (24, 10). No 3-star can be formed with Node 24 as the center.
17. Node 0 has 1 edge: (0, 3). No 3-star can be formed with Node 0 as the center.
18. Node 15 has 2 edges: (15, 9), (15, 18). No 3-star can be formed with Node 15 as the center.
19. Node 18 has 4 edges: (18, 23), (18, 11), (18, 6), (18, 15). No 3-star can be formed with Node 18 as the center.
20. Node 20 has 2 edges: (20, 19), (20, 16). No 3-star can be formed with Node 20 as the center.
21. Node 21 has 3 edges: (21, 17), (21, 8), (21, 2). No 3-star can be formed with Node 21 as the center.
22. Node 9 has 3 edges: (9, 19), (9, 16), (9, 15). No 3-star can be formed with Node 9 as the center.
23. Node 12 has 4 edges: (12, 1), (12, 22), (12, 13), (12, 10). No 3-star can be formed with Node 12 as the center.
24. Node 2 has 3 edges: (2, 11), (2, 4), (2, 21). No 3-star can be formed with Node 2 as the center.
25. Node 10 has 4 edges: (10, 23), (10, 4), (10, 24), (10, 12). No 3-star can be formed with Node 10 as the center.
26. Node 5 has 4 edges: (5, 17), (5, 25), (5, 29), (5, 7). No 3-star can be formed with Node 5 as the center.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<23, (8, 11, 18)>
<23, (8, 10, 18)>
