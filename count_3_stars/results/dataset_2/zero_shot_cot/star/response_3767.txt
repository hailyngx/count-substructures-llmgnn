Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Start by identifying all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- For each of these nodes, check if they are connected in a star configuration (center node connected to exactly three nodes).

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 5.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 4.
   
2. Check if these nodes form 3-stars:
   - For node 8: (8, 6, 9), (8, 7, 0), (8, 5, 8) are 3-stars.
   - For node 9: (9, 6, 1), (9, 8, 7), (9, 4, 0) are 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].


<8, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (7, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 8, 8)>
<9, (6, 1, 9)>
<9, (8, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 0, 9)>
