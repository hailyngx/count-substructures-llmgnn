Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to find the 3-stars. 
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 have degree 3, thus, they could potentially be central nodes of 3-stars.

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 2)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the graph.
