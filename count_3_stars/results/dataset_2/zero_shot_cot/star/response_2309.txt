Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 6) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
  
Unique 3-stars found: 
<10, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (8, 9, 1)>
<14, (0, 6, 9)>
<12, (8, 13, 14)>
