Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the unique combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <3, (1, 4, 8)>
2. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
3. <8, (4, 3, 2)>
4. <2, (9, 8, 0)>
5. <7, (5, 8, 6)>
6. <5, (1, 8, 7)>
7. <0, (6, 2, 5)>
8. <6, (7, 0, 3)>
9. <9, (8, 2, 0)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [9].
