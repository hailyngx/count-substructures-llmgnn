Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 11) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 17) (16, 4) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (6, 13) (6, 1) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (18, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 17) (9, 15) (9, 10) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's start by identifying the central node and its neighboring nodes in each potential 3-star:
- The central node must have exactly 3 neighboring nodes to form a 3-star.
- The neighboring nodes must be distinct and cannot be the center.

From the given edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<8, (2, 14, 19)>
<13, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (5, 14, 18)>
<12, (4, 11, 17)>
<0, (13, 14, -)>
<2, (4, 8, -)>
<5, (4, 7, 19)>
<19, (5, 8, 17)>
<14, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 12, 2)>
<17, (12, 15, 19)>
<1, (6, 10, 13)>
<6, (1, 10, 13)>
<18, (7, -, -)>
<11, (12, 5, -)>
<16, (4, -, -)>
<15, (4, 9, 17)>
<9, (10, 15, -)>
<10, (1, 2, 9)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
