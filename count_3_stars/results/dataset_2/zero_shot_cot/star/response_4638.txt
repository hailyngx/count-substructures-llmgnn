Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 16) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 19) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 2) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 18) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 18) (16, 4) (16, 1) (11, 14) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 3) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 13) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star configurations in the given graph based on the definition provided.
- Node 2 is the center with leaves 8, 3, and 17. (<2, (8, 3, 17)>)
- Node 3 is the center with leaves 6, 2, and 14. (<3, (6, 2, 14)>)
- Node 4 is the center with leaves 9, 16, and 14. (<4, (9, 16, 14)>)
- Node 5 is the center with leaves 18, 15, and 7. (<5, (18, 15, 7)>)
- Node 8 is the center with leaves 2, 14, and 10. (<8, (2, 14, 10)>)
- Node 10 is the center with leaves 12, 0, and 18. (<10, (12, 0, 18)>)
- Node 14 is the center with leaves 7, 5, and 11. (<14, (7, 5, 11)>)
- Node 15 is the center with leaves 1, 19, and 5. (<15, (1, 19, 5)>)
- Node 18 is the center with leaves 13, 0, and 11. (<18, (13, 0, 11)>)
- Node 19 is the center with leaves 12, 15, and 13. (<19, (12, 15, 13)>)

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
