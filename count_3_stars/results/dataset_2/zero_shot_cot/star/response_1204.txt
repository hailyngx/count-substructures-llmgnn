Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 2) (11, 19) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 12) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 19) (2, 14) (2, 6) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 18) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) (6, 16) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to form 3-star structures. 

Based on the given edges, the nodes connected to three other nodes are:
- Node 1 (connected to 3, 16, 17)
- Node 3 (connected to 1, 13, 17)
- Node 7 (connected to 5, 9, 16)
- Node 8 (connected to 12, 15, 16)
- Node 9 (connected to 7, 12, 15)
- Node 10 (connected to 0, 12, 16)
- Node 12 (connected to 8, 9, 10)
- Node 13 (connected to 3, 10, 18)
- Node 14 (connected to 2, 4, 15)
- Node 16 (connected to 6, 7, 8)
- Node 17 (connected to 3, 5, 7)
- Node 19 (connected to 4, 8, 15)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<1, (3, 16, 17)>
<3, (1, 13, 17)>
<7, (5, 9, 16)>
<8, (12, 15, 16)>
<9, (7, 12, 15)>
<10, (0, 12, 16)>
<12, (8, 9, 10)>
<13, (3, 10, 18)>
<14, (2, 4, 15)>
<16, (6, 7, 8)>
<17, (3, 5, 7)>
<19, (4, 8, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
