Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its edges in a more readable format:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 6, 8, 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 3, 6, 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 6, 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 1, 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 1, 3, 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 2, 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 7, 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 3, 0.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 1, 6)>
<1, (5, 4, 3)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<4, (8, 2, 1)>
<5, (8, 1, 5)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<7, (8, 2, 7)>
<8, (5, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
