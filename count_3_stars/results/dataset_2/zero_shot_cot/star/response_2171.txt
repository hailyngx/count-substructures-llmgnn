Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (9, 3, 10)>
<4, (7, 1, 14)>
<10, (0, 11, 8)>
<7, (11, 13, 3)>
<14, (0, 2, 13)>
<12, (11, 5, 0)>
