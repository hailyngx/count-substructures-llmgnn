Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the nodes that can serve as the center of a 3-star. Nodes with degree 3 can act as the centers because they are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, the nodes with degree 3 are: 5, 4, 7, 3, and 6.

Now, let's check the neighbors of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars:

1. Node 5: (5, 9, 6), (5, 9, 4), (5, 4, 7), (5, 7, 3), (5, 3, 6) [<5, (9, 6, 4)>]
2. Node 4: (4, 9, 7), (4, 7, 3), (4, 5, 9) [<4, (9, 7, 5)>]
3. Node 7: (7, 4, 3), (7, 3, 5), (7, 5, 9) [<7, (4, 3, 5)>]
4. Node 3: (3, 5, 7), (3, 5, 6), (3, 1, 7) [<3, (5, 7, 6)>]
5. Node 6: (6, 3, 5), (6, 3, 0), (6, 5, 9) [<6, (3, 5, 0)>]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
