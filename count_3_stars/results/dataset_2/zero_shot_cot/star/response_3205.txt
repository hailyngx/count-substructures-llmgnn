Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<6, (9, 8, 2)>
<9, (6, 2, 3)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<0, (9, 1, -)>
<2, (6, 4, 9)>
<7, (9, 5, -)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
