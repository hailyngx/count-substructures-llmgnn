Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is the center of a 3-star. 

We will start by listing all the possible 3-stars:

<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 0)>
<3, (7, 4, X)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (6, 9, 1)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 8, 5)>
<0, (6, 1, 4)>

Now, we count the unique 3-stars found:
[9]
