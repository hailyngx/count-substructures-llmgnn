Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.

4-star candidates:
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 13, and 2
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 11, and 14
- Node 4: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 7: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 1: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 3: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 12: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 2: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 8: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 0: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 14: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 13: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 10: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 6: Does not have exactly 3 connections
- Node 11: Does not have exactly 3 connections

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are <5, (9, 13, 2)> and <9, (5, 11, 14)>.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
