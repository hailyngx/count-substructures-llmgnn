Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- For each potential center node, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.
- If we find a 3-star, we will list it inside <> brackets.

Now, let's go through the graph step by step:

1. Node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 7, 9, 5, 1, 3, and 2.
   - Not a 3-star.

2. Node 7:
   - Connected to nodes 4, 3, 2, 8, 13, and 1.
   - Not a 3-star.

3. Node 6:
   - Connected to nodes 9, 1, 12, and 8.
   - <6, (9, 1, 12)>

4. Node 9:
   - Connected to nodes 4, 6, 1, and 0.
   - <9, (4, 6, 1)>

5. Node 10:
   - Connected to nodes 11 and 5.
   - Not a 3-star.

6. Node 11:
   - Connected to nodes 10, 14, 0, 13, 5, and 12.
   - Not a 3-star.

7. Node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 14.
   - <2, (4, 7, 14)>

8. Node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 7, 6, and 5.
   - <8, (7, 6, 5)>

9. Node 0:
   - Connected to nodes 9, 11, and 3.
   - <0, (9, 11, 3)>

10. Node 1:
    - Connected to nodes 4, 7, 6, 9, and 14.
    - Not a 3-star.

11. Node 12:
    - Connected to nodes 6, 11, and 13.
    - Not a 3-star.

12. Node 14:
    - Connected to nodes 11, 2, 1, and 13.
    - Not a 3-star.

13. Node 3:
    - Connected to nodes 4, 7, and 0.
    - <3, (4, 7, 0)>

14. Node 5:
    - Connected to nodes 4, 10, 11, and 8.
    - <5, (4, 10, 11)>

15. Node 13:
    - Connected to nodes 7, 11, 12, and 14.
    - Not a 3-star.

The unique 3-stars found are: <6, (9, 1, 12)>, <9, (4, 6, 1)>, <2, (4, 7, 14)>, <8, (7, 6, 5)>, <0, (9, 11, 3)>, <3, (4, 7, 0)>, and <5, (4, 10, 11)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
