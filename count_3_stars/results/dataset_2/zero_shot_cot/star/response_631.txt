Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 7) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 12) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 19) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 19) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of nodes that are incident to exactly three edges. Let's identify the central nodes for each potential 3-star in the graph:

1. Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 17, and 13.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 3, and 1.
4. Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 1.
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 6.
6. Node 4 is connected to nodes 15, 13, and 8.
7. Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 17.
8. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 15, and 0.
9. Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 18, and ---.
10. Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 12.
11. Node 14 is connected to nodes 18, 12, and ---.
12. Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and ---.
13. Node 0 is connected to nodes 16, 10, and 17.
14. Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 19, and 0.
15. Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 2, and ---.
16. Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 7.
17. Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 10, and 19.
18. Node 19 is connected to nodes 16, 7, and 2.
19. Node 7 is connected to nodes 17, 18, and 19.
20. Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 19, and 12.

Therefore, the 3-stars are: 
<1, (5, 13, 17)>
<5, (1, 3, 13)>
<13, (1, 5, 4)>
<4, (8, 13, 15)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<15, (3, 4, 17)>
<3, (5, 0, 15)>
<9, (8, 18, 6)>
<18, (9, 12, 14)>
<10, (0, 2, ---)>
<16, (11, 0, 19)>
<11, (16, 2, ---)>
<17, (1, 0, 7)>
<2, (11, 10, 19)>
<19, (16, 2, 7)>
<7, (17, 18, 19)>
<6, (8, 12, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
