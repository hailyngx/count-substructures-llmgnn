Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (12, 5) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 3) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 3) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {5, 15, 6}
- Node 1: {16, 2, 8}
- Node 2: {8, 1, 13}
- Node 3: {17, 14, 19}
- Node 4: {10, 17}
- Node 5: {9, 12}
- Node 6: {18, 2, 0}
- Node 7: {16, 10, 14}
- Node 8: {9, 2, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 18}
- Node 10: {11, 15, 7}
- Node 11: {10, 14, 17}
- Node 12: {5}
- Node 13: {2, 15}
- Node 14: {11, 7, 3}
- Node 15: {10, 0, 18}
- Node 16: {7, 1, 18}
- Node 17: {11, 3, 4}
- Node 18: {16, 9, 15}
- Node 19: {3}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.
There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
- <0, (5, 15, 6)>
- <2, (8, 1, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
