Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<1, (4, 10, 7)>
<2, (8, 0, 11)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by summing up the unique 3-stars found:
[3]
