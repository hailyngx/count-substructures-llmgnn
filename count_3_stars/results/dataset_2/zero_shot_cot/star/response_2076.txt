Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (1, 7, 6)>
- <4, (8, 2, 9)>
- <8, (4, 9, 5)>
- <9, (1, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 8, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 8, 7)>
- <0, (4, 9, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
