Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. We can identify them based on the edges they are involved in. 
  
Nodes connected to 3 other nodes:
- Node 4: (4, 8), (4, 11), (4, 2)
- Node 7: (7, 12), (7, 6), (7, 13), (7, 1)
- Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 10)
- Node 12: (12, 7), (12, 10), (12, 11), (12, 3), (12, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 9)
- Node 13: (13, 7), (13, 9), (13, 14), (13, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 8), (9, 12), (9, 2), (9, 13), (9, 0)
- Node 1: (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 0)
- Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 13), (6, 1), (6, 14), (6, 11)
- Node 10: (10, 8), (10, 12), (10, 3), (10, 14)
- Node 11: (11, 4), (11, 12), (11, 5), (11, 1), (11, 6)
- Node 14: (14, 13), (14, 6), (14, 10), (14, 11)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Total number of 3-stars: [12]

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (8, 2, 11)>
<7, (12, 6, 1)>
<8, (4, 9, 10)>
<12, (7, 11, 3)>
<2, (4, 9, 8)>
<13, (7, 6, 14)>
<9, (8, 2, 13)>
<1, (7, 0, 6)>
<6, (7, 13, 1)>
<10, (8, 12, 14)>
<11, (4, 12, 5)>
<14, (13, 6, 10)>
