Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

<6, (2, 8, 13)>
<9, (4, 11, 12)>
<8, (2, 5, 13)>
<13, (0, 10, 6)>
<0, (1, 3, 14)>
