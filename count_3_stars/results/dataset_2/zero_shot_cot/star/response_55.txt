Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars in this graph are: 
<6, (9, 14, 4)>
<9, (6, 14, 0)>
<1, (3, 5, 13)>
<3, (1, 0, 13)>
<10, (7, 4, 2)>
<11, (3, 14, 7)>
<8, (1, 13, 14)>
<13, (1, 3, 11)>
<7, (10, 11, 8)>
<12, (13, 7, 4)>
<5, (1, 13, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
