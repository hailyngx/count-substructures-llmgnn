Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 21) (7, 14) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 18) (21, 17) (21, 7) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 10) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 18) (9, 22) (9, 2) (9, 3) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 27) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (20, 8) (20, 4) (20, 24) (6, 8) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 12) (16, 27) (11, 23) (11, 4) (11, 29) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 0) (1, 0) (1, 25) (1, 13) (29, 11) (29, 4) (29, 18) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 25) (27, 26) (27, 16) (18, 7) (18, 23) (18, 15) (18, 29) (18, 5) (8, 14) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 28) (19, 24) (25, 28) (25, 1) (25, 5) (12, 15) (12, 13) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 12) (24, 7) (24, 20) (24, 19) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 20) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, following the definition of a 3-star graph. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 8, 7, and 4.
   <14, (17, 8, 7)>
   <14, (17, 7, 4)>

2. Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 21, and 7.
   <17, (14, 21, 7)>

3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 14, 21, and 24.
   <7, (14, 21, 24)>
   <7, (14, 21, 18)>
   
4. Node 21 is connected to nodes 17, 7, and 14.
   <21, (17, 7, 14)>

5. Node 22 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 10.
   <22, (9, 5, 10)>

6. Node 23 is connected to nodes 11, 26, and 18.
   <23, (11, 26, 18)>

7. Node 26 is connected to nodes 23, 28, and 27.
   <26, (23, 28, 27)>

8. Node 28 is connected to nodes 26, 19, and 5.
   <28, (26, 19, 5)>
   <28, (26, 5, 10)>
   <28, (26, 5, 25)>

9. Node 10 is connected to nodes 22, 28, and 0.
   <10, (22, 28, 0)>
   
10. Node 29 is connected to nodes 11, 4, and 18.
   <29, (11, 4, 18)>

11. Node 0 is connected to nodes 10, 1, and 2.
   <0, (10, 1, 2)>

12. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 25, and 13.
   <1, (0, 25, 13)>

13. Node 5 is connected to nodes 22, 28, and 2.
   <5, (22, 28, 2)>
   <5, (22, 28, 18)>
   <5, (28, 10, 25)>

14. Node 27 is connected to nodes 26, 16, and 5.
   <27, (26, 16, 5)>

15. Node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 23, and 15.
   <18, (7, 23, 15)>
   <18, (23, 26, 15)>
   <18, (29, 4, 15)>
   <18, (5, 28, 15)>
   <18, (5, 28, 29)>

By listing out all the unique 3-stars found above, we can see that there are <15, (18, 7, 23)> and <15, (18, 13, 12)> that are not counted by nodes selected during the process. This gives us a total of 18 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
