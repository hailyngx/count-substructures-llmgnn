Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 4) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 2) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with the central nodes, we can see that nodes 10, 11, 8, 13, 7, 12, 2, 0, 4, 1, 6, 14, 5, and 3 are all connected to exactly three other nodes.

Upon analyzing the relationships, we find the 3-stars as follows:
<10, (11, 13, 5)>
<11, (10, 7, 1)>
<8, (2, 14, 6)>
<13, (10, 4, 0)>
<7, (11, 12, 0)>
<12, (7, 4, 2)>
<2, (8, 12, 5)>
<0, (7, 4, 5)>
<4, (11, 13, 12)>
<1, (11, 12, 14)>
<6, (8, 12, 2)>
<14, (10, 8, 1)>
<5, (10, 2, 0)>
<3, (10, 8, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
