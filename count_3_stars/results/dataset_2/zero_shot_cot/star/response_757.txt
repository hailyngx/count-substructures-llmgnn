Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 8) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 5) (17, 10) (4, 27) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 7) (6, 28) (6, 1) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 0) (29, 21) (29, 11) (26, 28) (26, 0) (26, 27) (27, 4) (27, 26) (27, 25) (27, 14) (18, 24) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 25) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 12) (9, 10) (9, 24) (9, 13) (9, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 23) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 2) (16, 8) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 5) (21, 29) (21, 14) (24, 18) (24, 9) (24, 12) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 0) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 22) (2, 13) (2, 25) (2, 11) (5, 10) (5, 16) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 3) (11, 29) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 22) (19, 20) (19, 12) (19, 23) (20, 19) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 24) (12, 19) (22, 10) (22, 16) (22, 7) (22, 11) (14, 27) (14, 21) (23, 13) (23, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. 
For a node to be considered a center of a 3-star, it needs to have exactly three neighbors connected to it.

Based on the given edges, the possible 3-star patterns are as follows:
- Node 10: (17, 8, 9)
- Node 4: (27, 13, 1)
- Node 1: (6, 15, 25)
- Node 28: (6, 26, 0)
- Node 27: (26, 25, 14)
- Node 9: (24, 13, 12)
- Node 25: (27, 15, 2)
- Node 16: (8, 22, 5)
- Node 21: (29, 14, 11)
- Node 12: (15, 9, 24)
- Node 22: (16, 7, 11)
- Node 19: (20, 12, 23)

There are no other nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [12] and they are:
<10, (17, 8, 9)>
<4, (27, 13, 1)>
<1, (6, 15, 25)>
<28, (6, 26, 0)>
<27, (26, 25, 14)>
<9, (24, 13, 12)>
<25, (27, 15, 2)>
<16, (8, 22, 5)>
<21, (29, 14, 11)>
<12, (15, 9, 24)>
<22, (16, 7, 11)>
<19, (20, 12, 23)>
