Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 4) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 8) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 15) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 17) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 10) (13, 19) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

By inspecting the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars. Let's list them:

<1, (3, 6, 15)>
<2, (0, 7, 17)>
<4, (1, 5, 15)>
<8, (6, 14, 16)>
<10, (13, 14, 15)>
<12, (11, 17, 19)>
<13, (9, 11, 15)>
<16, (7, 8, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
