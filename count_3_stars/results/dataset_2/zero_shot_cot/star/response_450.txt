Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 20) (9, 7) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 20) (14, 17) (14, 11) (17, 14) (17, 11) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 21) (7, 22) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 8) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 13) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 5) (12, 27) (12, 24) (12, 28) (12, 25) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 6) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 3) (8, 21) (8, 10) (8, 15) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 16) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 1) (6, 21) (6, 27) (6, 25) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 0) (28, 12) (28, 16) (28, 0) (1, 24) (1, 15) (1, 20) (15, 8) (15, 1) (5, 10) (5, 29) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (0, 29) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 4) (4, 22) (4, 0) (3, 18) (3, 20) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 3) (23, 18) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 19) (19, 21) (19, 12) (19, 25) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
2. We will go through each node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, we will form a 3-star with this node as the center and the three connected nodes as the leaves.

Based on the given edges, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<7, (9, 17, 21)>
<12, (24, 27, 28)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
