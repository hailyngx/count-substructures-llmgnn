Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify which nodes form 3-stars. In this case, we are looking for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.

Let's find the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 8, 13, 1, 11 (5 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 4, 14, 9, 2, 1 (5 neighbors)
- Node 10 has neighbors: 8, 14 (2 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 11, 9, 5 (4 neighbors)
- Node 12 has neighbors: 9, 8, 5, 2 (4 neighbors)

Nodes 4 and 7 have exactly 3 neighbors, which means they can form 3-stars. Let's find all the unique 3-stars involving nodes 4 and 7:

- <4, (7, 1, 13)>
- <4, (7, 1, 8)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find a total of 58 unique 3-stars. 

Thus, the final answer is: [58].
