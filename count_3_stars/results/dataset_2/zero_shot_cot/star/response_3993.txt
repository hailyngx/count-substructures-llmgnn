Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (5, 16) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (13, 9) (13, 5) (19, 12) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 10) (14, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (2, 6, 15)>
<5, (16, 9, 13)>
<7, (11, 3, 8)>
<9, (6, 5, 18)>
<11, (7, 1, 16)>
<12, (0, 7, 19)>
<13, (9, 5, 19)>
<16, (11, 1, 5)>
<18, (1, 2, 9)>
<19, (0, 12, 13)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
