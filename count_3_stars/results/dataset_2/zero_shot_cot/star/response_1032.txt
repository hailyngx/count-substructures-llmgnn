Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (22, 13) (22, 21) (15, 29) (15, 28) (27, 6) (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 3) (26, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (21, 22) (21, 1) (21, 17) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 11) (29, 15) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 10) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 17) (4, 19) (4, 28) (4, 11) (8, 26) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (20, 11) (17, 21) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 5) (3, 26) (3, 24) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 20) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 23) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 23) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 24) (18, 10) (18, 25) (28, 15) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 12) (6, 27) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 12) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 23) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 5) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 18) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 25) (25, 16) (25, 18) (25, 6) (25, 12) (23, 0) (23, 19) (23, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, list the three nodes it is connected to, forming a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<7, (0, 5, 24)>
<9, (14, 19, 26)>
<11, (2, 4, 20)>
<15, (28, 29, 1)>
<16, (2, 13, 25)>
<17, (1, 5, 29)>
<18, (10, 25, 6)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [7].
