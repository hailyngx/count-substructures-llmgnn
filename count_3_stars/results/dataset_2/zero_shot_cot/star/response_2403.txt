Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (12, 4, 6)>
2. <1, (12, 2, 14)>
3. <2, (12, 1, 3)>
4. <3, (12, 8, 5)>
5. <4, (12, 0, 13)>
6. <5, (12, 9, 13)>
7. <6, (12, 1, 14)>
8. <7, (12, 9, 6)>
9. <8, (12, 10, 3)>
10. <9, (12, 7, 5)>
11. <10, (12, 8, 14)>
12. <11, (6, 0, 12)>
13. <13, (4, 0, 12)>
14. <14, (6, 1, 10)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [14].
