Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 12) (22, 25) (22, 1) (3, 25) (25, 22) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 27) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 16) (23, 9) (4, 8) (4, 11) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 1) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 5) (29, 10) (21, 8) (21, 28) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 20) (27, 25) (27, 8) (27, 10) (7, 25) (7, 29) (7, 6) (16, 23) (16, 6) (16, 15) (10, 29) (10, 27) (10, 19) (15, 18) (15, 16) (15, 26) (11, 23) (11, 4) (11, 5) (24, 12) (24, 1) (9, 23) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (1, 22) (1, 18) (1, 24) (1, 19) (20, 28) (20, 19) (14, 23) (14, 21) (14, 6) (26, 15) (26, 12) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 0) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 24) (12, 26) (12, 0) (0, 17) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) (19, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the given edge list, the 3-star configurations are as follows:
<22, (13, 12, 25)>
<25, (3, 7, 27)>
<8, (23, 4, 21)>
<23, (8, 11, 14)>
<18, (2, 15, 1)>
<17, (29, 12, 0)>
<29, (17, 7, 5)>
<21, (8, 28, 14)>
<27, (25, 8, 10)>
<7, (25, 29, 6)>
<16, (23, 6, 15)>
<10, (29, 27, 19)>
<15, (18, 16, 26)>
<11, (23, 4, 5)>
<24, (12, 1, 0)>
<9, (23, 0)>
<6, (7, 16, 14)>
<1, (22, 18, 24)>
<20, (28, 19)>
<26, (15, 12)>
<5, (8, 29, 11)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 21. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
