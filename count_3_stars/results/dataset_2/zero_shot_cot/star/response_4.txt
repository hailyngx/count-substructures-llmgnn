Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes while forming a star shape. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that could be centers of 3-stars based on their degree being 3:
- Node 6 has degree 4.
- Node 9 has degree 2.
- Node 4 has degree 5.
- Node 8 has degree 6.
- Node 5 has degree 3.
- Node 0 has degree 5.
- Node 7 has degree 4.
- Node 3 has degree 6.
- Node 1 has degree 3.
- Node 2 has degree 6.

2. From the list above, we can see that nodes 5 and 1 are the only potential centers of 3-stars.

3. Now, let's check the neighbors of nodes 5 and 1 to see if they form 3-stars:
- Node 5: (5, 8, 0), (5, 3, 7)
- Node 1: (1, 8, 7), (1, 2, 0)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in this graph are <5, (8, 0, 3)> and <1, (8, 7, 2)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
