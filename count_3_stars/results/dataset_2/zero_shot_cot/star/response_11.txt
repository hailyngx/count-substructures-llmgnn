Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (22, 28) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 29) (15, 20) (15, 6) (0, 27) (0, 7) (27, 0) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 16) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 21) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 18) (21, 2) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (17, 25) (17, 23) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 20) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 11) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 10) (29, 3) (29, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 28) (9, 27) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 23) (24, 25) (2, 21) (2, 11) (16, 27) (16, 9) (16, 6) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 24) (25, 23) (11, 20) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (6, 15) (6, 14) (6, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 28) (10, 18) (10, 12) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 17) (23, 9) (23, 25) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 5) (28, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify each 3-star. 

We look for nodes that have exactly three edges to other nodes, forming a star shape with the node as the center. 

Let's check each node:
- Node 0: Degree 2 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 1: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 1 with 3, 5, 29)
- Node 2: Degree 2 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 3: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 3 with 1, 7, 29)
- Node 4: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 4 with 8, 18, 28)
- Node 5: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 5 with 1, 12, 28)
- Node 6: Degree 3 (forms a 3-star: 6 with 14, 16, 15)
- Node 7: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 7 with 3, 0, 23)
- Node 8: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 8 with 4, 9, 20)
- Node 9: Degree 5 (forms a 3-star: 9 with 8, 11, 16)
- Node 10: Degree 2 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 11: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 11 with 9, 20, 19)
- Node 12: Degree 3 (forms a 3-star: 12 with 5, 10, 28)
- Node 13: Degree 2 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 14: Degree 3 (forms a 3-star: 14 with 6, 8, 15)
- Node 15: Degree 3 (forms a 3-star: 15 with 6, 14, 20)
- Node 16: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 16 with 6, 9, 27)
- Node 17: Degree 3 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 18: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 18 with 4, 21, 26)
- Node 19: Degree 2 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 20: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 20 with 15, 8, 11)
- Node 21: Degree 3 (forms a 3-star: 21 with 7, 18, 2)
- Node 22: Degree 1 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 23: Degree 5 (forms a 3-star: 23 with 7, 25, 3)
- Node 24: Degree 1 (does not form a 3-star)
- Node 25: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 25 with 27, 17, 23)
- Node 26: Degree 3 (forms a 3-star: 26 with 1, 18, 19)
- Node 27: Degree 5 (forms a 3-star: 27 with 0, 25,21)
- Node 28: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 28 with 4, 12, 5)
- Node 29: Degree 4 (forms a 3-star: 29 with 3, 1, 15)

After examining all nodes, we found the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 29)>
<3, (1, 7, 29)>
<4, (8, 18, 28)>
<5, (1, 12, 28)>
<6, (14, 16, 15)>
<7, (3, 0, 23)>
<8, (4, 9, 20)>
<9, (8, 11, 16)>
<11, (9, 20, 19)>
<12, (5, 10, 28)>
<14, (6, 8, 15)>
<15, (6, 14, 20)>
<16, (6, 9, 27)>
<18, (4, 21, 26)>
<20, (15, 8, 11)>
<21, (7, 18, 2)>
<23, (7, 25, 3)>
<25, (27, 17, 23)>
<26, (1, 18, 19)>
<27, (0, 25, 21)>
<28, (4, 12, 5)>
<29, (3, 1, 15)>

There are total [22] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
