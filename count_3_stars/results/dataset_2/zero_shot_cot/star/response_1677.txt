Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (14, 7) (14, 17) (17, 14) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 16) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 16) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 0) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (12, 10) (12, 5) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 13) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 18) (0, 1) (0, 9) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are three steps to solve this problem:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Check if those nodes form a 3-star pattern.
3. Count the total number of 3-stars found.

Let's follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
Here are the nodes that meet this criterion: 4, 2, 13, 6

Step 2: Check if these nodes form a 3-star pattern.
Let's check each node:

- Node 4: (4, 13), (4, 2) -> Forms a 3-star with leaves 13, 2.
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 8) -> Forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 3, 8.
- Node 13: (13, 4), (13, 6), (13, 18) -> Does not form a 3-star.
- Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 15), (6, 13) -> Forms a 3-star with leaves 7, 15, 13.

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found.
There are two 3-stars:
<4, (13, 2)>
<6, (7, 15, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
