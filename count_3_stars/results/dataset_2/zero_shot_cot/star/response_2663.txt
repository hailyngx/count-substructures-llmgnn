Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes as this will help us identify the 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 4
- Node 3
- Node 2
- Node 1

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the final answer is [6].
