Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: <5, (2, 4, 8)> and <7, (0, 4, 8)>
So, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
