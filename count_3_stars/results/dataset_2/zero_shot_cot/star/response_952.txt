Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 5, 1, 11
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 0, 3, 6
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 1, 2
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 10, 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 13, 2, 12
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 9, 14, 6
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 5, 3, 14, 0
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 12, 5
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 2
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 10, 14, 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 2
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 11, 13, 1, 14
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 13, 2, 1, 9

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <4, (7, 9, 5)>
- <4, (7, 9, 1)>
- <4, (7, 5, 1)>
- <4, (9, 5, 1)>
- <7, (4, 12, 0)>
- <7, (4, 12, 3)>
- <7, (4, 12, 6)>
- <7, (12, 0, 3)>
- <7, (12, 0, 6)>
- <7, (12, 3, 6)>
- <10, (11, 8, 1)>
- <10, (11, 8, 2)>
- <10, (11, 1, 2)>
- <11, (4, 10, 9)>
- <8, (10, 13, 2)>
- <8, (13, 9, 6)>
- <13, (9, 14, 6)>
- <12, (7, 8, 6)>
- <2, (10, 5, 3)>
- <2, (5, 6, 14)>
- <5, (4, 6, 2)>
- <6, (7, 13, 12)>
- <0, (7, 2, 14)>
- <1, (4, 14, 9)>
- <1, (10, 14, 9)>
- <1, (9, 14, 4)>
- <3, (7, 2, 14)>
- <9, (11, 13, 4)>
- <14, (13, 2, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [28].
