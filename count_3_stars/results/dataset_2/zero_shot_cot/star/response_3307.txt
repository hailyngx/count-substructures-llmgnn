Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 29) (21, 4) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 5) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 29) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 29) (8, 17) (23, 27) (23, 8) (23, 0) (24, 15) (24, 26) (26, 27) (26, 24) (26, 7) (0, 23) (0, 19) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 14) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 9) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 3) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 28) (25, 19) (25, 9) (25, 13) (11, 14) (11, 20) (4, 21) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 10) (5, 27) (5, 8) (5, 20) (29, 21) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 28) (9, 25) (20, 1) (20, 11) (20, 5) (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 3) (6, 18) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 19) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are central nodes in the 3-star graphs. Since a central node in a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that are incident to exactly three edges.

The nodes incident to exactly three edges are: 1, 7, 0, 2, 6. 

Next, we will find the 3-star graphs by considering each of these nodes as the center and determining the connected nodes. 

For node 1:
The 3-stars centered at node 1 are:
<1, (21, 20, 28)>
<1, (21, 27, 29)>
So, there are 2 3-stars centered at node 1.

For node 7:
There are no 3-stars centered at node 7 since it is not connected to exactly three edges.

For node 0:
The 3-stars centered at node 0 are:
<0, (23, 19, 25)>
So, there is 1 3-star centered at node 0.

For node 2:
There are no 3-stars centered at node 2 since it is not connected to exactly three edges.

For node 6:
There are no 3-stars centered at node 6 since it is not connected to exactly three edges.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [3].
