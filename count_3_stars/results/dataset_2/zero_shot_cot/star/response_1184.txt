Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 1, forming the 3-star <9, (5, 6, 1)>.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 4, forming the 3-star <6, (9, 7, 4)>.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 8, forming the 3-star <1, (9, 3, 8)>.

Thus, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [3].
