Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node has exactly three neighbors, forming a 3-star structure.

Let's start by listing out the potential 3-star configurations:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, 9)>

Now, let's count how many of these 3-stars are present in the given graph:

[9]
