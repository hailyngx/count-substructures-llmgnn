Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 14) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 29) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 5) (0, 3) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 7) (7, 27) (7, 23) (7, 17) (20, 25) (20, 29) (25, 20) (25, 10) (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 18) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 29) (12, 27) (12, 11) (12, 16) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (22, 19) (22, 28) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 5) (29, 26) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 11) (29, 14) (18, 9) (18, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 4) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 6) (24, 0) (24, 17) (17, 7) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 28) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 17) (28, 14) (13, 2) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 23) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 16) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 29) (14, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with three edges connected to them. 

The nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to 3, 27, 11)
- Node 1 (connected to 18, 26, 23)
- Node 2 (connected to 4, 6, 19)
- Node 5 (connected to 14, 15, 19)
- Node 7 (connected to 17, 23, 27)
- Node 9 (connected to 14, 18, 26)
- Node 10 (connected to 19, 25, 8)
- Node 15 (connected to 3, 5, 29)
- Node 17 (connected to 7, 16, 24)
- Node 19 (connected to 2, 5, 10)
- Node 20 (connected to 25, 29, 15)
- Node 23 (connected to 6, 7, 1)
- Node 26 (connected to 1, 9, 29)
- Node 28 (connected to 14, 17, 22)
- Node 29 (connected to 11, 14, 15)

From the list above, we can see that there are <0, (3, 27, 11)>, <1, (18, 26, 23)>, <2, (4, 6, 19)>, <5, (14, 15, 19)>, <7, (17, 23, 27)>, <9, (14, 18, 26)>, <10, (19, 25, 8)>, <15, (3, 5, 29)>, <17, (7, 16, 24)>, <19, (2, 5, 10)>, <20, (25, 29, 15)>, <23, (6, 7, 1)>, <26, (1, 9, 29)>, <28, (14, 17, 22)>, <29, (11, 14, 15)>. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
