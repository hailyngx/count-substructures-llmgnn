Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars found in the graph:

<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<7, (0, 3, 2)>
<8, (4, 1, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (8, 5, 2)>
<2, (7, 6, 0)>
<0, (7, 8, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
