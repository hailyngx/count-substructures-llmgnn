Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 24) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (10, 17) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 20) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 16) (0, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 22) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 7) (4, 21) (27, 28) (27, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (25, 15) (25, 18) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 22) (19, 21) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 6) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 5) (24, 1) (24, 16) (24, 23) (24, 20) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 6) (29, 13) (29, 7) (29, 12) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 28) (5, 8) (5, 16) (5, 18) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 22) (6, 7) (21, 4) (21, 19) (18, 25) (18, 5) (18, 12) (20, 11) (20, 24) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 29) (12, 18) (28, 27) (28, 15) (23, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in the 3-star configuration. 

Looking at the edges, we can see that node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 12, 19, and 16. Since it has exactly 3 connections (excluding itself), node 14 can potentially be the center node of a 3-star graph.

Next, let's check each potential 3-star centered at node 14:
- Node 0, 12, 19, and 16 are connected to node 14, forming the 3-star <14, (0, 12, 19)>.
- Node 0, 12, and 16 are connected to node 14, forming the 3-star <14, (0, 12, 16)>.
- Node 0, 19, and 16 are connected to node 14, forming the 3-star <14, (0, 19, 16)>.

So, there are <14, (0, 12, 19)>, <14, (0, 12, 16)>, and <14, (0, 19, 16)> 3-stars in the given graph.

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.]
