Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. 

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 5: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) -> <5, (9, 6, 3)>
2. Node 9: (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) -> <9, (5, 4, 3)>
3. Node 4: (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) -> <4, (9, 8, 0)>
4. Node 8: (8, 4) (8, 3) -> No 3-stars as it is connected to only 2 nodes.
5. Node 6: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) -> <6, (5, 1, 3)>
6. Node 0: (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) -> <0, (9, 4, 7)>
7. Node 2: (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) -> <2, (4, 1, 7)>
8. Node 7: (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) -> <7, (5, 0, 2)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
Unique 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>, <6, (5, 1, 3)>, <0, (9, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 1, 7)>
