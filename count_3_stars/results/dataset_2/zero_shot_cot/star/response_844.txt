Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 15) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 9) (21, 3) (21, 8) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 1) (4, 27) (4, 20) (8, 21) (8, 2) (8, 17) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 15) (29, 16) (29, 14) (29, 24) (2, 27) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 25) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 20) (26, 24) (26, 18) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 26) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 1) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 23) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 10) (3, 6) (14, 29) (14, 19) (28, 18) (28, 3) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 14) (23, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (25, 2) (25, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 22) (20, 4) (20, 24) (20, 22) (1, 27) (1, 5) (1, 18) (6, 3) (6, 15) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
Since a 3-star has 4 nodes, we will look for sets of 4 nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes.

Let's first identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 1, and 13.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 12, 4, and 2.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 13, 26, and 1.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 15, and 29.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 27, 19, and 17.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 16, 24, and 14.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 12, 8, and 15.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 21, 2, and 17.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 27, 5, and 18.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 17, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 21, 28, and 10.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 25.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 27, 20, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 27, 8, and 25.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 24, 18, and 10.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 19, and 9.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 29, 19, and 15.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 19.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 23.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 29, 26, and 20.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 28.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 20.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 9.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 4, 24, and 22.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 18, 3, and 6.
- Node 23 is connected to node 0.

By counting the number of times each node appears in the list above, we will be able to find how many 3-stars there are in the graph.

Based on this analysis, there are 22 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [22]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (11, 1, 13)>
<27, (12, 4, 2)>
<18, (13, 26, 1)>
<16, (11, 15, 29)>
<12, (27, 19, 17)>
<29, (16, 24, 14)>
<17, (12, 8, 15)>
<8, (21, 2, 17)>
<1, (27, 5, 18)>
<15, (16, 17, 6)>
<3, (21, 28, 10)>
<13, (5, 18, 25)>
<4, (27, 20, 2)>
<2, (27, 8, 25)>
<26, (24, 18, 10)>
<7, (0, 19, 9)>
<14, (29, 19, 15)>
<21, (3, 8, 19)>
<0, (7, 13, 23)>
<24, (29, 26, 20)>
<6, (3, 15, 28)>
<22, (5, 10, 20)>
