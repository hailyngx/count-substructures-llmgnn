Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 2) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (13, 8, 3)>
<9, (13, 3, 6)>
<7, (12, 0, 10)>
<12, (7, 4, 2)>
<13, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 11)>
<11, (3, 6, 4)>
<0, (7, 12, 3)>
<4, (12, 13, 11)>
<2, (12, 13, 1)>
<8, (5, 3, 6)>
<6, (13, 11, 8)>
<14, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (12, 4, 2)>
<10, (7, 3, 1)>

There are total 15 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [15].
