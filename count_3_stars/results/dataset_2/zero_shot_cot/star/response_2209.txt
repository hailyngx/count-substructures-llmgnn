Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 18) (7, 14) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 12) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (13, 16) (13, 18) (13, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star is formed by a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (11, 5, 2)>
<1, (15, 14, 2)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (8, 2, 10)>
<5, (3, 0, 12)>
<7, (18, 14, 2)>
<8, (16, 4, 6)>
<9, (11, 15, 12)>
<10, (8, 13, 12)>
<11, (0, 9, 17)>
<12, (10, 17, 5)>
<13, (16, 18, 10)>
<14, (1, 15, 7)>
<15, (1, 9, 14)>
<16, (13, 8, 18)>
<17, (11, 18, 6)>
<18, (7, 17, 13)>
<19, (14)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: 
There are 18 unique 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
