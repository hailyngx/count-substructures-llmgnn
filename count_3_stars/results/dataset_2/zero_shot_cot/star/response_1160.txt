Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the number of nodes that have exactly 3 adjacent edges. Let's first identify those nodes:
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 8) --> 5 edges
- Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 3) --> 3 edges
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 2), (1, 5) --> 4 edges
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 14), (3, 10) --> 4 edges
- Node 10: (10, 3), (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 13) --> 4 edges
- Node 11: (11, 1), (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 13) --> 4 edges
- Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7) --> 4 edges
- Node 13: (13, 10), (13, 11), (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 0) --> 5 edges
- Node 4: (4, 8), (4, 12), (4, 5), (4, 2) --> 4 edges
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 13), (5, 4), (5, 7) --> 5 edges
- Node 0: (0, 10), (0, 13), (0, 14), (0, 7) --> 4 edges
- Node 14: (14, 3), (14, 11), (14, 0), (14, 7) --> 4 edges
- Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 14) --> 5 edges

Now we can count the number of 3-stars based on the number of unique combinations we can form. Each 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes.

Total number of 3-stars: [3]

Unique 3-stars: <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <13, (10, 11, 5)>
