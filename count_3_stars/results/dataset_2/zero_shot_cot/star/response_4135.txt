Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 28) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 12) (22, 25) (3, 5) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 26) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (28, 13) (28, 29) (28, 10) (28, 23) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 10) (0, 20) (0, 18) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 23) (20, 11) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 17) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (26, 4) (26, 20) (26, 14) (9, 22) (9, 1) (9, 27) (17, 18) (17, 6) (27, 18) (27, 9) (27, 19) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 2) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 6) (16, 24) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 19) (12, 22) (12, 10) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 23) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 20) (23, 24) (7, 15) (7, 1) (7, 5) (25, 22) (25, 2) (10, 28) (10, 29) (10, 2) (10, 12) (11, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's start by listing all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<2, (4, 18, 25)>
<4, (2, 8, 29)>
<5, (3, 7, 19)>
<6, (1, 8, 17)>
<7, (1, 15, 5)>
<8, (4, 6, 14)>
<9, (22, 1, 27)>
<10, (28, 2, 29)>
<12, (22, 10, 13)>
<14, (8, 19, 26)>
<15, (7, 14, 23)>
<17, (6, 18, 27)>
<18, (4, 17, 27)>
<19, (5, 14, 27)>
<20, (0, 11, 23)>
<22, (9, 12, 25)>
<23, (15, 20, 24)>
<24, (16, 23, 24)>
<25, (2, 12, 22)>
<26, (4, 14, 20)>
<27, (18, 19, 27)>
<28, (10, 13, 29)>
<29, (4, 10, 28)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars listed above:
