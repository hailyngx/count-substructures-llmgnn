Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 28) (22, 20) (5, 27) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 23) (10, 18) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 18) (4, 23) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 19) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 24) (21, 28) (21, 25) (21, 17) (28, 22) (28, 21) (28, 14) (28, 23) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 20) (26, 25) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 27) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (24, 2) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 29) (0, 17) (0, 25) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 28) (18, 10) (18, 11) (29, 1) (29, 24) (29, 6) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 3) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 24) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 15) (20, 22) (20, 26) (15, 17) (15, 14) (25, 21) (25, 26) (25, 0) (25, 16) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 25) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars using the given edges: 

<13, (27, 22, 26)>
<22, (13, 16, 28)>
<5, (27, 13, 1)>
<9, (16, 2, 23)>
<10, (18, 11, 13)>
<11, (23, 19, 18)>
<4, (6, 23, 13)>
<8, (2, 1, 9)>
<7, (19, 14, 28)>
<12, (19, 13, 16)>
<0, (17, 25, 6)>
<29, (24, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 3, 29)>
<19, (24, 11, 7)>
<3, (6, 14, 4)>
<14, (28, 15, 7)>
<20, (26, 22, 12)>
<15, (14, 17, 28)>
<25, (16, 21, 26)>
<16, (25, 22, 9)>
<27, (1, 5, 13)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars listed above. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
