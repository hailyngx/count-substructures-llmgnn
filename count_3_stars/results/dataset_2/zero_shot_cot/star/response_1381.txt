Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 3) (26, 7) (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 24) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 26) (7, 27) (1, 28) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 26) (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 20) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 29) (6, 9) (6, 24) (28, 1) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 15) (29, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 21) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 19) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 27) (10, 19) (21, 8) (21, 0) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 5) (25, 17) (25, 5) (25, 2) (24, 16) (24, 6) (2, 25) (2, 5) (2, 20) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 2) (5, 12) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 29) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 21) (0, 15) (15, 29) (15, 0) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 5) (27, 7) (27, 10) (27, 19) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 2) (19, 23) (19, 10) (19, 27) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<9, (26, 6, 8)>
<26, (9, 3, 7)>
<11, (16, 23, 0)>
<16, (11, 24, 4)>
<4, (9, 10, 14)>
<7, (26, 27, -)>
<1, (28, 10, 8)>
<3, (26, - , -)>
<13, (22, 17, 20)>
<22, (13, 20, -)>
<18, (14, 12, 29)>
<6, (9, 24, -)>
<28, (1, 29, -)>
<29, (18, 15, 14)>
<8, (9, 1, 21)>
<23, (11, 20, 19)>
<10, (4, 1, 27)>
<21, (8, 0, -)>
<17, (13, 25, 12)>
<25, (17, 5, 2)>
<24, (16, 6, -)>
<2, (25, 5, 20)>
<5, (17, 25, 2)>
<14, (4, 18, 29)>
<0, (9, 11, 21)>
<15, (29, 0, -)>
<12, (11, 18, 17)>
<27, (7, 10, 19)>
<20, (13, 22, 23)>
<19, (23, 10, 27)>

There are a total of [30] 3-stars in the given graph.
