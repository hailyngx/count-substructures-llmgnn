Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the list of nodes to find all the 3-stars:

1. Central node 0: (1, 4, 9)
2. Central node 1: (7, 10, 11)
3. Central node 2: (1, 4, 12)
4. Central node 3: (5, 10, 13)
5. Central node 4: (1, 2, 14)
6. Central node 5: (3, 6, 13)
7. Central node 6: (0, 5, 11)
8. Central node 7: (1, 9, 13)
9. Central node 8: (0, 9, 13)
10. Central node 9: (0, 7, 8)
11. Central node 10: (1, 3, 14)
12. Central node 11: (6, 7, 14)
13. Central node 12: (2, 3, 7)
14. Central node 13: (3, 5, 8)
15. Central node 14: (4, 11, 1)

Now, let's count the total number of distinct 3-stars in the graph.

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15.]

<0, (1, 4, 9)>, <1, (7, 10, 11)>, <2, (1, 4, 12)>, <3, (5, 10, 13)>, <4, (1, 2, 14)>, <5, (3, 6, 13)>, <6, (0, 5, 11)>, <7, (1, 9, 13)>, <8, (0, 9, 13)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <10, (1, 3, 14)>, <11, (6, 7, 14)>, <12, (2, 3, 7)>, <13, (3, 5, 8)>, <14, (4, 11, 1)>
