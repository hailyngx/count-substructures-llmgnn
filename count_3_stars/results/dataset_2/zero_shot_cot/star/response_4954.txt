Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of times each node appears as a central node in a 3-star. We will list all the 3-stars, and then count the unique central nodes to find the answer.

1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 6)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
4. <3, (2, 5, 8)>
5. <4, (2, 8, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 3, 6)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 5)>
8. <7, (4, 6, 9)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 3)>
10. <9, (4, 7, 8)>

There are 10 unique central nodes, so the final answer is [10].
