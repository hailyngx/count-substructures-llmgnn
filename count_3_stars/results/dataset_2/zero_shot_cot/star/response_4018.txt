Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 12) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 18) (9, 3) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 13) (3, 5) (3, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 15) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 14) (13, 12) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 4) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 10, 16, and 15.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 17, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 1.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 17.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 8, 17, and 4.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 17, and 4.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 8, 7, and 13.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 12.

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is 1. (<4, (10, 16, 15)>)
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 5 is 1. (<5, (11, 17, 3)>)
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 9 is 1. (<9, (11, 7, 1)>)
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 12 is 1. (<12, (6, 1, 17)>)
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 15 is 1. (<15, (8, 17, 4)>)
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 16 is 1. (<16, (7, 17, 4)>)
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 18 is 1. (<18, (8, 7, 13)>)
- The number of 3-stars centered at node 19 is 1. (<19, (7, 1, 12)>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
