Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are adjacent to each node:
- Node 0: 3, 10, 7, 12, 13, 9
- Node 1: 3, 14, 10, 12, 7
- Node 2: 3, 12, 5
- Node 3: 1, 0, 2
- Node 4: 13, 5
- Node 5: 11, 4, 8, 14, 2, 13
- Node 6: 12, 14
- Node 7: 1, 8, 10, 12, 0
- Node 8: 5, 14, 7
- Node 9: 10, 11, 13, 0, 14
- Node 10: 1, 0, 12, 9
- Node 11: 9, 5
- Node 12: 1, 10, 7, 2, 0, 6
- Node 13: 4, 5, 9, 0
- Node 14: 1, 8, 5, 9, 6

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 0: <0, (3, 10, 7)>, <0, (13, 9, 10)>
- From node 1: <1, (3, 14, 10)>, <1, (7, 12, 10)>
- From node 2: <2, (3, 5, 12)>, <2, (5, 14, 2)>
- From node 3: <3, (1, 0, 2)>
- From node 4: <4, (13, 5, 11)>
- From node 5: <5, (11, 14, 8)>, <5, (13, 9, 8)>
- From node 6: <6, (12, 14, 1)>
- From node 7: <7, (1, 0, 12)>, <7, (10, 8, 14)>
- From node 8: <8, (14, 5, 7)>
- From node 9: <9, (13, 0, 10)>, <9, (11, 5, 13)>
- From node 10: <10, (0, 7, 12)>, <10, (1, 9, 14)>
- From node 11: <11, (5, 14, 9)>
- From node 12: <12, (0, 7, 1)>
- From node 13: <13, (4, 9, 5)>
- From node 14: <14, (8, 5, 9)>, <14, (6, 1, 8)>

Counting the above 3-stars, we have a total of [16].
