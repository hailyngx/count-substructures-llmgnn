Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <6, (9, 8, 5)>
2. <9, (6, 8, 1)>
3. <1, (9, 5, -)>
4. <3, (7, 0, 2)>
5. <4, (8, 5, 2)>
6. <8, (6, 9, 4)>
7. <5, (6, 1, 4)>
8. <0, (6, 3, 8)>
9. <2, (6, 3, 4)>
10. <7, (3, 8, -)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
