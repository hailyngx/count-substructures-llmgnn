Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 20) (3, 4) (25, 6) (25, 24) (12, 4) (12, 11) (27, 14) (27, 5) (2, 24) (2, 14) (2, 21) (18, 11) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 0) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 28) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 4) (28, 10) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 8) (29, 13) (0, 26) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 28) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 22) (5, 27) (5, 23) (5, 21) (5, 10) (19, 29) (19, 24) (10, 28) (10, 5) (10, 15) (10, 13) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 23) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 28) (4, 0) (23, 5) (23, 15) (20, 1) (20, 26) (20, 16) (8, 29) (8, 21) (24, 25) (24, 2) (24, 19) (16, 20) (16, 22) (16, 14) (22, 7) (22, 16) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 21) (13, 29) (13, 10) (13, 14) (11, 12) (11, 18) (11, 26) (21, 2) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center in a 3-star pattern. These nodes will be the ones with exactly three edges connected to them.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 26, 6, 20)
- Node 26 (connected to nodes 1, 15, 20)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 25, 28)
- Node 28 (connected to nodes 6, 7, 10)
- Node 17 (connected to nodes 29, 0, 7)
- Node 29 (connected to nodes 17, 19, 8)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 26, 17, 7)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 28, 17, 0)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 27, 23, 21)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 28, 5, 15)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 26, 7, 10)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 3, 12, 28)
- Node 24 (connected to nodes 25, 2, 19)
- Node 22 (connected to nodes 7, 16)
- Node 16 (connected to nodes 20, 22, 14)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 27, 2, 16, 13)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 29, 10, 14)
- Node 11 (connected to nodes 12, 18, 26)
- Node 21 (connected to nodes 2, 5, 8)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- There are <1, (26, 6, 20)>
- There are <26, (1, 15, 20)>
- There are <6, (1, 25, 28)>
- There are <28, (6, 7, 10)>
- There are <17, (29, 0, 7)>
- There are <29, (17, 19, 8)>
- There are <0, (26, 17, 7)>
- There are <7, (28, 17, 0)>
- There are <5, (27, 23, 21)>
- There are <10, (28, 5, 15)>
- There are <15, (26, 7, 10)>
- There are <4, (3, 12, 28)>
- There are <24, (25, 2, 19)>
- There are <22, (7, 16, 22)>
- There are <16, (20, 22, 14)>
- There are <14, (27, 2, 16), (13, 10, 14)>
- There are <11, (12, 18, 26)>
- There are <21, (2, 5, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
