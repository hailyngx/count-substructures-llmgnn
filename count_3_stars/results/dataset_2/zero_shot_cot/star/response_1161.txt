Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 17) (8, 14) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 18) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 16) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 17) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 9) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (18, 6) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (9, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 18) 

Response:
Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<7, (12, 11, 19)>
<12, (7, 4, 16)>
<2, (16, 3, 17)>
<8, (14, 3, 18)>
<5, (6, 11, 18)>
<6, (5, 18, 18)>
<19, (7, 10, 16)>
<4, (12, 0, 17)>
<0, (4, 10, 18)>
<10, (19, 0, 9)>
<16, (12, 2, 19)>
<11, (7, 5, 18)>
<14, (8, 18, 1)>
<18, (6, 0, 11)>
<1, (7, 4, 14)>
<13, (16, 1, 15)>
<9, (10, 0, 0)>
<3, (2, 8, 17)>
<15, (13, 13, 13)>
<17, (2, 4, 18)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
