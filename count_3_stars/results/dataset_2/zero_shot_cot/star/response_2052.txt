Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-star graphs.

The nodes with exactly three edges are: 0, 2, 4, and 6.

Now, let's look for the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<0, (9, 10, 11)>
<2, (7, 3, 1)>
<4, (7, 6, 12)>
<6, (4, 12, 13)>
