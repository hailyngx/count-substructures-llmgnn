Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 21) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 1) (21, 29) (21, 4) (2, 29) (2, 0) (29, 21) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 16) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (27, 11) (27, 16) (27, 8) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 16) (23, 10) (23, 20) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (17, 29) (17, 26) (17, 4) (11, 27) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 6) (28, 22) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 10) (18, 26) (18, 9) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 7) (7, 26) (25, 8) (15, 13) (15, 19) (5, 12) (5, 11) (19, 11) (19, 15) (16, 29) (16, 27) (16, 23) (9, 14) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 10) (24, 8) (24, 14) (10, 12) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 20) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 17) (4, 6) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with exactly three edges connecting to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly three edges connecting to them are:  
Node 13  
Node 22  
Node 1  
Node 21  
Node 29  
Node 12  
Node 8  
Node 23  
Node 0  
Node 14  
Node 17  
Node 27  
Node 28  
Node 26  
Node 9  
Node 3  
Node 20  
Node 24  
Node 10  
Node 4  
Node 6  

Next, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<13, (22, 4, 15)>  
<22, (13, 28, 21)>  
<1, (21, 20, 28)>  
<21, (22, 1, 29)>  
<29, (21, 2, 17)>  
<12, (5, 10, 0)>  
<8, (27, 23, 24)>  
<23, (8, 16, 10)>  
<0, (2, 12, 14)>  
<14, (0, 9, 24)>  
<17, (29, 26, 4)>  
<27, (11, 16, 8)>  
<28, (22, 1, 9)>  
<26, (17, 18, 7)>  
<9, (14, 28, 18)>  
<3, (12, 9, 6)>  
<20, (1, 23, 10)>  
<24, (8, 14, 25)>  
<10, (12, 23, 28)>  
<4, (13, 21, 17)>  
<6, (11, 3, 4)>  

There are [21] 3-stars in the given graph.
