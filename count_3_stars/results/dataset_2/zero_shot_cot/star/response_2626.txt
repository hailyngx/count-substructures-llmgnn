Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Nodes {4, 5, 7} form a 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (5, 7)>
2. Nodes {7, 2, 10} form a 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (2, 10)>
3. Nodes {1, 2, 3} form a 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (2, 3)>
4. Nodes {2, 6, 8} form a 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (6, 8)>
5. Nodes {5, 6, 13} form a 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (6, 13)>
6. Nodes {0, 6, 14} form a 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (0, 14)>
7. Nodes {3, 9, 10} form a 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (9, 10)>
8. Nodes {8, 11, 14} form a 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (11, 14)>
9. Nodes {9, 12, 13} form a 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (12, 13)>

Therefore, there are 9 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [9].
