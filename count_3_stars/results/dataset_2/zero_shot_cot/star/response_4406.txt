Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (5, 14) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:
1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are potential central nodes of 3-stars.
2. For each potential central node, we will check if it is indeed the center of a 3-star by looking at the nodes it is connected to and confirming if they form a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<7, (12, 9, 10)>
<12, (7, 0, 14)>
<0, (12, 2, 14)>
<14, (12, 4, 6)>
<5, (14, 1, 6)>
<6, (14, 5, 10)>
<13, (5, 3, 6)>
<1, (5, 2, 9)>
<10, (7, 6, 3)>
<4, (14, 1, 11)>
<8, (5, 10, 11)>
<9, (7, 1, 4)>
<3, (13, 10, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
