Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (26, 15) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 25) (21, 14) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 8) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 23) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 25) (20, 5) (20, 10) (20, 16) (5, 12) (5, 20) (5, 13) (5, 17) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 4) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 22) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 16) (29, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (22, 9) (22, 28) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 24) (13, 3) (13, 18) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 7) (15, 26) (15, 12) (15, 0) (15, 14) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 8) (25, 21) (25, 0) (25, 7) (25, 14) (25, 2) (4, 27) (4, 6) (4, 17) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 7) (8, 3) (23, 27) (23, 11) (23, 18) (16, 20) (16, 29) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 4) (18, 13) (18, 23) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 24) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 25) (2, 3) (24, 13) (24, 3) (10, 20) (10, 29) (10, 14) (14, 21) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 28, 15, and 25: <0, (28, 15, 25)>
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 12, 20, and 13: <5, (12, 20, 13)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 12, 19, and 7: <8, (12, 19, 7)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 19, and 24: <13, (5, 19, 24)>
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 21, 15, and 25: <14, (21, 15, 25)>
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 26, 12, and 0: <15, (26, 12, 0)>
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 20, 29, and 10: <16, (20, 29, 10)>
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 1, 25, and 14: <21, (1, 25, 14)>
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 9, 28, and 22: <22, (9, 28, 22)>
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 21, 0, and 7: <25, (21, 0, 7)>
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 4, 29, and 23: <27, (4, 29, 23)>
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 27, 28, and 16: <29, (27, 28, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
