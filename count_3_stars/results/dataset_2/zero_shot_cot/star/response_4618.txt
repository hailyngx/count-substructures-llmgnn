Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 22) (21, 20) (21, 29) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 22) (23, 26) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 15) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 24) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 18) (3, 7) (3, 22) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (26, 23) (26, 25) (26, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 25) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 27) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 24) (18, 20) (18, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 22) (25, 26) (25, 11) (25, 28) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 19) (19, 14) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 24) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 24) (24, 17) (24, 14) (24, 29) (24, 10) (24, 28) (27, 6) (27, 10) (27, 28) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 6) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 3) (22, 12) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 27) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<2, (8, 13, 11)>
<7, (3, 9, 14)>
<10, (6, 18, 27)>
<11, (1, 2, 0)>
<14, (7, 19, 24)>
<15, (5, 13, 6)>
<20, (17, 18, 21)>
<24, (14, 29, 10)>
<25, (26, 28, 11)>
<26, (23, 6, 25)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [10].
