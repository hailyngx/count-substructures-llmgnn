Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 19) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 10) (8, 0) (8, 15) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the node with the highest degree, which is node 18, forming 3-stars. 

1. Node 18 is connected to nodes 14, 4, 16, 17, and 5.
   <18, (14, 4, 16)>
   <18, (4, 16, 17)>
   <18, (16, 17, 5)>

2. Node 17 is connected to nodes 16, 15, 11, and 5.
   <17, (16, 15, 11)>
   <17, (16, 11, 5)>
   <17, (15, 11, 5)>

3. Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 18, 17, and 1.
   <16, (7, 18, 17)>

From the above combinations, we have found a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is: [6].
