Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. We can then check all combinations of edges emanating from these center nodes to form 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes
- Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, and Node 3 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Step 2: Find 3-stars for each identified center:
- For Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>
- For Node 7: <7, (4, 2, 8)>, <7, (3, 2, 4)>
- For Node 8: <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <8, (7, 0, 1)>
- For Node 3: <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 
Unique 3-stars found: <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 2, 8)>, <7, (3, 2, 4)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <8, (7, 0, 1)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 6, 9)>.
