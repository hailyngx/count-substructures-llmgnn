Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 7) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 14) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 7) (6, 10) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 16) (18, 8) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (16, 17) (16, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 9) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<3, (1, 13, 8)>
<15, (10, 4, 3)>
<14, (17, 5, 13)>
<17, (16, 14, 14)>
<1, (3, 7, 7)>
<10, (11, 6, 6)>
<11, (19, 12, 0)>
<4, (15, 8, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 0)>
<5, (14, 11, 18)>
<6, (10, 5, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 12)>
<12, (11, 7, 16)>
<18, (8, 5, 5)>
<19, (11, 0, 0)>
<16, (17, 12, 7)>
<0, (11, 19, 9)>
<9, (14, 7, 0)>
<13, (3, 14, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [18]
