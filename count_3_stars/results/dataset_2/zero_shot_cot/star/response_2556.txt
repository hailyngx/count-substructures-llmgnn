Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 12) (1, 3) (1, 4) (10, 17) (11, 7) (11, 19) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 12) (5, 19) (5, 0) (6, 17) (6, 14) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 16) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 2) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 9) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 0) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 9) (2, 17) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes with degree 3 connected with unique edges. 

Let's first find these 3-star configurations:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 13, 14)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 19)>
<5, (0, 12, 19)>
<6, (14, 17, 6)>
<7, (11, 9, 17)>
<8, (3, 4, 12)>
<9, (7, 16, 9)>
<10, (17, 19, 6)>
<11, (7, 19, 11)>
<12, (0, 8, 18)>
<13, (18, 2, 12)>
<14, (7, 16, 6)>
<15, (0, 12, 15)>
<16, (9, 14, 19)>
<17, (10, 7, 2)>
<18, (12, 13, 15)>
<19, (4, 8, 16)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find there are <19> 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
