Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 28) (9, 11) (26, 19) (26, 27) (0, 24) (0, 11) (0, 19) (27, 26) (27, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 4) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 18) (23, 18) (23, 17) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 14) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 10) (19, 26) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 25) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (21, 11) (21, 22) (7, 6) (7, 17) (25, 19) (25, 24) (29, 9) (29, 22) (14, 15) (14, 18) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 13) (28, 18) (17, 23) (17, 7) (17, 4) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 29) (22, 2) (5, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 12) (12, 20) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 16) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 21) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 16) (4, 10) (10, 20) (10, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-star configurations. 

1. First, let's identify all the nodes connected to exactly three nodes since that would fit the definition of a 3-star:
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 15.
   - Node 15 is connected to nodes 8, 19, and 20.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 17, and 16.
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 8, 23, and 14.
   - Node 20 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 12.
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 20, 18, and 10.

2. Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:
   - <8, (11, 6, 15)>
   - <15, (8, 19, 20)>
   - <4, (3, 17, 16)>
   - <18, (8, 23, 14)>
   - <20, (3, 15, 12)>

3. Finally, count the number of unique 3-stars: [5]
