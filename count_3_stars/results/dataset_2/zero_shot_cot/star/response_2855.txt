Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (9, 8, 4)>
2. <6, (9, 5, 3)>
3. <9, (5, 6, 4)>
4. <4, (5, 9, 8)>
5. <8, (5, 9, 4)>
6. <2, (9, 4, 1)>
7. <0, (6, 7, 3)>
8. <7, (6, 0, 1)>
9. <1, (9, 4, 8)>
10. <3, (5, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
