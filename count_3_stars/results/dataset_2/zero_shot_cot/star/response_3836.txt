Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes would be potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes with 3 edges each are: 1, 2, 5, 0, 8.

Now, let's check each of these nodes to see if they are indeed centers of 3-stars and count the total number of 3-stars.

For node 1:
It is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as center and nodes 3, 5, 7 as leaves. 
<1, (3, 5, 7)>

For node 2:
It is connected to nodes 3, 8. However, node 2 doesn't have exactly 3 edges, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

For node 5:
It is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7. This forms a 3-star with node 5 as center and nodes 1, 3, 7 as leaves.
<5, (1, 3, 7)>

For node 0:
It is connected to nodes 3, 6, 7. This forms a 3-star with node 0 as center and nodes 3, 6, 7 as leaves.
<0, (3, 6, 7)>

For node 8:
It is connected to nodes 1, 4, 2. However, node 8 doesn't have exactly 3 edges, so it cannot be a center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, and <0, (3, 6, 7)>.
