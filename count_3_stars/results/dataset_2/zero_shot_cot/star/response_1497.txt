Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the subgraphs that meet the criteria of a 3-star. 

We start by listing out the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5, 4, 3, 8
- Node 1: 5, 4, 7, 6, 2
- Node 2: 9, 7, 1, 6, 8
- Node 3: 7, 0
- Node 4: 9, 8, 1, 0
- Node 5: 9, 6, 1, 0
- Node 6: 5, 1, 2, 8
- Node 7: 9, 3, 2, 1
- Node 8: 9, 4, 6, 2, 0
- Node 9: 5, 8, 2, 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 4, 6)>
- <1, (5, 7, 2)>
- <1, (4, 7, 2)>
- <1, (4, 5, 0)>
- <1, (7, 2, 6)>
- <2, (9, 7, 6)>
- <2, (9, 7, 8)>
- <2, (9, 1, 6)>
- <2, (7, 1, 4)>
- <2, (7, 3, 0)>
- <4, (9, 8, 5)>
- <4, (9, 8, 6)>
- <5, (9, 6, 1)>
- <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- <6, (5, 1, 2)>
- <6, (5, 1, 8)>
- <6, (5, 2, 8)>
- <7, (9, 3, 1)>
- <8, (9, 2, 4)>
- <8, (9, 2, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars identified, we get a total of 19. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
