Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
By observing the given edges, we can find all the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them out.

<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 0, -)>
<7, (3, 2, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (9, 7, 1)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<0, (9, 4, 3)>
<2, (5, 7, 1)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
