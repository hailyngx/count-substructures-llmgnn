Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (9, 10, 11)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 14)>
<3, (5, 6, 14)>
<4, (1, 2, 12)>
<5, (1, 3, 14)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 7, 13)>
<9, (0, 1, 13)>
<10, (0, 11, 14)>
<11, (0, 10, 13)>
<12, (4, 5, 11)>
<13, (8, 9, 11)>
<14, (4, 5, 10)>

Now, let's count how many unique 3-stars we have in total:
