Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 14) (3, 4) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

Given the definition of a 3-star, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 edges coming out of them. Let's list these nodes first:

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 5
- Node 4
- Node 7
- Node 2
- Node 14

Now we will form the 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the center one by one:

For Node 5:
<5, (9, 6, 12)>
<5, (9, 6, 11)>
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<5, (9, 11, 4)>
<5, (9, 11, 7)>
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<5, (6, 12, 11)>
<5, (6, 12, 4)>
<5, (6, 12, 7)>
<5, (6, 11, 4)>
<5, (6, 11, 7)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (12, 11, 4)>
<5, (12, 11, 7)>
<5, (12, 4, 7)>
<5, (9, 11, 6)>
<5, (9, 4, 6)>
<5, (9, 7, 6)>
<5, (11, 4, 6)>
<5, (11, 7, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>

For Node 4:
<4, (5, 7, 6)>
<4, (5, 7, 11)>
<4, (5, 6, 11)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 10, 13)>
<4, (7, 10, 2)>
<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<4, (7, 2, 11)>
<4, (10, 13, 2)>
<4, (10, 13, 11)>
<4, (10, 2, 11)>
<4, (13, 10, 2)>
<4, (13, 10, 11)>
<4, (13, 2, 11)>

For Node 7:
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 11)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<7, (5, 4, 11)>
<7, (4, 10, 2)>
<7, (4, 10, 13)>
<7, (4, 10, 11)>
<7, (4, 2, 11)>
<7, (10, 13, 2)>
<7, (10, 2, 11)>
<7, (10, 13, 11)>
<7, (13, 10, 2)>
<7, (13, 10, 11)>
<7, (13, 2, 11)>

For Node 2:
<2, (9, 7, 11)>
<2, (9, 10, 11)>
<2, (9, 10, 14)>
<2, (9, 7, 6)>
<2, (7, 10, 13)>
<2, (7, 10, 4)>
<2, (7, 10, 11)>
<2, (10, 14, 8)>
<2, (10, 14, 3)>
<2, (10, 14, 1)>
<2, (10, 14, 13)>
<2, (14, 8, 3)>
<2, (14, 8, 1)>
<2, (14, 8, 13)>
<2, (8, 3, 14)>
<2, (8, 1, 14)>
<2, (8, 1, 13)>
<2, (3, 14, 1)>
<2, (3, 14, 13)>
<2, (1, 14, 13)>

For Node 14:
<14, (10, 8, 3)>
<14, (10, 8, 1)>
<14, (10, 8, 13)>
<14, (10, 3, 1)>
<14, (10, 3, 13)>
<14, (10, 1, 13)>
<14, (8, 3, 1)>
<14, (8, 3, 13)>
<14, (8, 1, 13)>
<14, (3, 1, 13)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars above, we get a total of 45 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [45].
