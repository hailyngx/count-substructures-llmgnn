Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 25) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 15) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 17) (20, 25) (20, 24) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 20) (25, 23) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 29) (12, 19) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 19) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 13) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 2) (28, 21) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 2) (29, 22) (29, 6) (29, 24) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 16) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 17) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 15) (10, 9) (10, 26) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 15) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 11) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (11, 27) (11, 2) (11, 26) (23, 25) (23, 6) (23, 19) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 19) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 23) (15, 21) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 12) (19, 27) (19, 23) (19, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the center of a 3-star in this graph. To be a center, a node must have exactly 3 edges connected to it. We find that nodes 1, 5, and 25 satisfy this condition.

Now, let's look for 3-stars with these nodes as the center:
- For node 1: (1, 3) (1, 25) (1, 25) -> <1, (3, 25, 25)>
- For node 5: (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 7) -> <5, (9, 25, 7)>
- For node 25: (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 20) -> <25, (1, 5, 20)>

So, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph. The unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 25, 25)>, <5, (9, 25, 7)>, and <25, (1, 5, 20)>.
