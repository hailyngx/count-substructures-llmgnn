Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 18) (4, 7) (4, 25) (4, 11) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 22) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 29) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 18) (22, 23) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 5) (20, 25) (20, 10) (25, 4) (25, 20) (25, 8) (25, 0) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 6) (0, 25) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 26) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 21) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 29) (11, 4) (11, 3) (16, 17) (16, 21) (28, 3) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 14) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 16) (21, 12) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 10) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 18) (29, 3) (29, 24) (24, 29) (24, 12) (12, 21) (12, 24) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 23) (6, 0) (10, 7) (10, 20) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the connections:

1. Node 27 is connected to nodes 15, 21, 22, and 18, forming the 3-star <27, (15, 21, 22)>.
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 25, 11, and 29, forming the 3-star <4, (7, 25, 11)>.
3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 29, 10, and 22, forming the 3-star <7, (4, 29, 10)>.
4. Node 22 is connected to nodes 27, 7, 18, and 23, forming the 3-star <22, (27, 7, 18)>.
5. Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 8, 1, and 19, forming the 3-star <14, (17, 8, 1)>.
6. Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 1, 16, and 5, forming the 3-star <17, (14, 1, 16)>.
7. Node 25 is connected to nodes 4, 20, 8, and 0, forming the 3-star <25, (4, 20, 8)>.
8. Node 23 is connected to nodes 22, 26, 6, and 27, forming the 3-star <23, (22, 26, 6)>.
9. Node 0 is connected to nodes 25, 6, 9, and 2, forming the 3-star <0, (25, 6, 9)>.
10. Node 2 is connected to nodes 14, 0, 5, and 13, forming the 3-star <2, (14, 0, 5)>.
11. Node 1 is connected to nodes 14, 17, 26, and 21, forming the 3-star <1, (14, 17, 26)>.
12. Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 28, 29, and 24, forming the 3-star <3, (11, 28, 29)>.
13. Node 21 is connected to nodes 27, 26, 16, and 12, forming the 3-star <21, (27, 26, 16)>.
14. Node 29 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 18, 3, and 24, forming the 3-star <29, (4, 7, 18)>.
15. Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 20, 5, and 13, forming the 3-star <10, (7, 20, 5)>.

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15.][15]
