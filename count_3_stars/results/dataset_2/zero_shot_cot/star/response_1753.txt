Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 0)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<1, (7, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>

As there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph, the answer is [10].
