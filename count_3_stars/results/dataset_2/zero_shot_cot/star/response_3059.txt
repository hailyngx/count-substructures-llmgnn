Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 8) (18, 14) (18, 13) (17, 15) (17, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 10) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (16, 4) (16, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 11) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 10) (13, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to node 3 to see if there are any 3-stars involving node 3. From the edges provided, we have (3, 15), (3, 2), and (3, 8). So, node 3 is the center of a 3-star <3, (15, 2, 8)>.

Next, let's look for other 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 17, and 4, forming 3-stars: <15, (3, 9, 17)> and <15, (3, 9, 4)>.

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9 and 19, creating a 3-star: <6, (9, 19, 6)>.

- Nodes 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, and 16 do not form any 3-star structures based on the given edges in the graph.

- Node 18 is connected to nodes 14 and 13, forming a 3-star: <18, (14, 13, 18)>.

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 19, 11, and 10, creating a 3-star: <5, (19, 11, 10)>.

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 12, forming a 3-star: <8, (3, 7, 12)>.

- Node 0 is connected to node 2 but does not form a 3-star structure.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <3, (15, 2, 8)>, <15, (3, 9, 17)>, <15, (3, 9, 4)>, <6, (9, 19, 6)>, <18, (14, 13, 18)>, and <5, (19, 11, 10)>.
