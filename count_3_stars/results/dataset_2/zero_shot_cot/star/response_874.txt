Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 3)>
<1, (3, 0, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<7, (6, 1, 2)>
<2, (9, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 1)>
<0, (1, 3, 4)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars. 

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is: [8].
