Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 10) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (19, 2) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star configuration.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 8, 15)>
<2, (6, 10, 18)>
<3, (1, 8, 13)>
<4, (11, 12, 13)>
<5, (0, 9, 18)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (12, 15, 16)>
<8, (1, 3, 15)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<10, (2, 6, 18)>
<11, (2, 4, 12)>
<12, (4, 7, 15)>
<13, (3, 4, 14)>
<14, (13, 17, 3)>
<15, (1, 7, 12)>
<16, (7, 12, 15)>
<17, (8, 14, 15)>
<18, (2, 5, 9)>
<19, (2, 4, 18)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph as counted above. Hence, the final answer is [20].
