Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 14.

Next, we check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 8, 5)>
<1, (11, 4, 2)>
<2, (4, 12, 5)>
<3, (13, 6, 9)>
<6, (12, 3, 14)>
<7, (10, 8, 1)>
<10, (0, 7, 14)>
<12, (2, 6, 9)>
<14, (2, 13, 7)>
