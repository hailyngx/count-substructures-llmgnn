Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (2, 8) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 9) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 12) (16, 19) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 0) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 13) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 14) (10, 6) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. (3, 8, 2)
2. (3, 8, 5)
3. (3, 8, 15)
4. (3, 9, 12)
5. (3, 9, 13)
6. (3, 9, 19)
7. (3, 15, 0)
8. (3, 15, 19)
9. (8, 3, 2)
10. (8, 3, 5)
11. (8, 3, 15)
12. (8, 5, 0)
13. (8, 5, 7)
14. (8, 5, 3)
15. (8, 2, 3)
16. (8, 2, 5)
17. (8, 2, 0)
18. (9, 3, 12)
19. (9, 3, 13)
20. (9, 3, 19)
21. (9, 12, 13)
22. (9, 12, 7)
23. (9, 12, 16)
24. (15, 3, 0)
25. (15, 3, 19)
26. (15, 0, 5)
27. (15, 0, 11)
28. (5, 8, 3)
29. (5, 8, 2)
30. (5, 8, 7)
31. (5, 8, 6)
32. (5, 0, 15)
33. (5, 0, 11)
34. (5, 0, 4)
35. (6, 5, 8)
36. (6, 5, 7)
37. (6, 5, 0)
38. (6, 7, 8)
39. (6, 7, 5)
40. (6, 7, 12)
41. (7, 12, 6)
42. (7, 12, 9)
43. (7, 12, 16)
44. (12, 9, 3)
45. (12, 9, 13)
46. (12, 9, 19)
47. (12, 7, 6)
48. (12, 7, 16)
49. (12, 7, 19)
50. (12, 17, 18)
51. (12, 17, 7)
52. (12, 17, 16)
53. (13, 9, 3)
54. (13, 9, 12)
55. (13, 9, 18)
56. (13, 18, 17)
57. (13, 18, 1)
58. (13, 18, 11)
59. (15, 0, 11)
60. (15, 0, 5)

Therefore, there are [60] 3-stars in the given graph.
