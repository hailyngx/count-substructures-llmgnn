Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 5) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 12) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 12) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (4, 9, 12)>
2. <3, (8, 9, 2)>
3. <5, (7, 11, 6)>
4. <8, (10, 13, 14)>
5. <9, (10, 8, 13)>
6. <10, (6, 8, 0)>
7. <11, (5, 7, 1)>
8. <12, (0, 1, 14)>
9. <13, (8, 12, 2)>

[There are 9 unique 3-stars in this graph.]
