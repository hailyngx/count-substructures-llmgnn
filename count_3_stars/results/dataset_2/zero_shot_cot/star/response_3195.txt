Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 13) (1, 27) (3, 10) (3, 12) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 25) (23, 15) (23, 21) (23, 10) (12, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (27, 1) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 26) (4, 22) (4, 14) (4, 26) (8, 16) (8, 25) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 13) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 20) (29, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 21) (26, 22) (26, 27) (26, 4) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 25) (11, 2) (24, 1) (24, 20) (20, 29) (20, 17) (20, 24) (15, 1) (15, 23) (21, 23) (21, 17) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (14, 22) (14, 4) (2, 28) (2, 11) (2, 0) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 19) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 11) (25, 13) (10, 3) (10, 23) (18, 12) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 18) 

Response:
The given graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find all 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Once we identify all such cases, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-star structures:

<1, (15, 24, 13)>
<2, (28, 11, 0)>
<4, (22, 14, 26)>
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<7, (19, 18, 7)>
<8, (25, 11, 16)>
<10, (3, 23, 27)>
<12, (3, 27, 18)>
<16, (9, 8, 18)>
<17, (29, 20, 21)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [10].
