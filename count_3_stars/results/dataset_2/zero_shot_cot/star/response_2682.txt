Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's examine the given graph:

1. From the given edge list, we can identify the following nodes as potential centers of 3-stars since they have exactly three edges:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 2.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 4, and 3.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 5.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 7.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 0.
   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 7.
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 3.
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 5.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 0.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 0.

2. Now, let's observe the combinations where a node is the central node and has exactly three neighbors to form unique 3-stars:

<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<8, (9, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 4, 0)>
<2, (6, 8, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (9, 8, 5)>
<1, (6, 8, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 0)>

3. Finally, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
