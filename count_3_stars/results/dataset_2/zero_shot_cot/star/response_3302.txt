Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 14) (18, 15) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 5) (17, 15) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 3) (19, 6) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 19) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 17) (15, 9) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 6) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
