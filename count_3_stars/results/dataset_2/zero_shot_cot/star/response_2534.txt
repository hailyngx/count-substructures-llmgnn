Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (8, 11) (8, 12) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 to form a 3-star:
- Node 4, 6, and 7 are connected to node 5.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars formed in the graph:
<5, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
