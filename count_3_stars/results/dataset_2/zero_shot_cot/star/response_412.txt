Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
The central node in a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes. Therefore, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have exactly three incident edges.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with exactly three incident edges are:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 9, 6, 8)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 5, 3, 0)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 9, 1, 0)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 3, 7, 8)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 5, 3, 2)

There are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 0)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<2, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 3, 2)>
