Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 4) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 19) (25, 16) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 20) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 2) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 6) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 5) (28, 4) (28, 22) (28, 12) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 13) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 14) (9, 8) (9, 22) (9, 29) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 28) (22, 9) (22, 24) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 6) (29, 13) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 27) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 23) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 27) (24, 22) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 12) (2, 25) (2, 15) (12, 28) (12, 23) (10, 3) (1, 25) (1, 29) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 19) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 0) (14, 21) (14, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars we can find in this graph:

<3, (10, 27, 19)>
<4, (16, 18, 28)>
<5, (13, 17, 0)>
<6, (20, 21, 17)>
<7, (16, 23, 14)>
<8, (13, 9, 0)>
<9, (8, 29, 22)>
<13, (8, 5, 21)>
<15, (20, 2, 22)>
<16, (7, 25, 22)>
<18, (4, 26, 5)>
<19, (3, 25, 0)>
<20, (15, 6, 13)>
<21, (13, 26, 14)>
<22, (9, 24, 28)>
<25, (16, 2, 1)>
<26, (18, 21, 23)>
<27, (3, 29, 7)>
<28, (4, 12, 22)>
<29, (9, 1, 27)>

By counting the unique 3-stars above, we find that there are [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
