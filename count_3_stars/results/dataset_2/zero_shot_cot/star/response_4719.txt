Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 0)>
<4, (5, 1, 7)>

So, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
