Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 13) (12, 10) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 1: (1, 9, 11), (1, 10, 2)
2. From node 2: (2, 1, 10), (2, 7, 6)
3. From node 3: (3, 0, 11), (3, 2, 6)
4. From node 4: (4, 0, 3)
5. From node 5: (5, 9, 13)
6. From node 6: (6, 0, 3), (6, 2, 7)
7. From node 7: (7, 2, 6)
8. From node 8: (8, 11, 14)
9. From node 9: (9, 1, 5)
10. From node 10: (10, 1, 12)
11. From node 11: (11, 0, 3)
12. From node 12: (12, 10, 13)
13. From node 13: (13, 5, 9)
14. From node 14: (14, 4, 8)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, 9, 11>, <1, 10, 2>, <2, 7, 6>, <3, 0, 11>, <3, 2, 6>, <4, 0, 3>, <5, 9, 13>, <6, 0, 3>, <6, 2, 7>, <8, 11, 14>, <10, 1, 12>.
