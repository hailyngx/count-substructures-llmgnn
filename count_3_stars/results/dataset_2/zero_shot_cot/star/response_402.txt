Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 2) (15, 4) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 6) (8, 1) (8, 11) (19, 1) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 16) (12, 10) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 18) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 10) (18, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all unique 3-stars found in the graph:

1. <5, (9, 6, 11)>
2. <9, (5, 4, 11)>
3. <11, (5, 9, 1)>
4. <1, (11, 19, 8)>
5. <3, (7, 13, 19)>
6. <6, (5, 17, 2)>
7. <17, (13, 6, 4)>
8. <13, (17, 3, 6)>
9. <16, (0, 7, 15)>
10. <2, (14, 6, 7)>
11. <10, (0, 2, 12)>
12. <12, (14, 16, 10)>
13. <0, (16, 10, 7)>
14. <7, (3, 16, 2)>
15. <15, (4, 16, 12)>
16. <8, (1, 11, 19)>
17. <18, (10, 11, 18)>
18. <14,(12, 2, 14)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: [18].
