Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 20) (3, 27) (3, 23) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 12) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 11) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 11) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 19) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 11) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 13) (28, 6) (28, 17) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 29) (21, 5) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 16) (29, 9) (29, 22) (29, 24) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 22) (2, 13) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 4) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 16) (20, 26) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 7) (23, 3) (23, 12) (25, 15) (25, 11) (5, 3) (5, 21) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 23) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 18) (7, 24) (7, 27) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 2) (19, 14) (19, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

First, let's identify the nodes that are part of the 3-stars:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 26, 6, 8, 29, and 1.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 9 and 20.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 27, 23, and 5.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 8, 25, 13, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 28, and 11.
- Nodes 10, 17, and 18 are connected to each other.
- Nodes 0, 14, 24, and 2 are connected to each other.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 1, and 11.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 6, 17, and 22.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 17, 2, and 29.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 5.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 8 and 1.
- Nodes 7, 27, and 23 are connected to each other.
- Nodes 19 and 20 are connected to each other.

Next, let's list all unique 3-stars:
<9, (26, 6, 8)>
<9, (26, 6, 29)>
<9, (26, 6, 1)>
<9, (6, 28, 17)>
<15, (8, 25, 13)>
<15, (8, 13, 12)>
<6, (9, 28, 11)>
<17, (10, 18, 4)>
<17, (10, 18, 13)>
<17, (10, 18, 2)>
<17, (18, 4, 11)>
<17, (18, 13, 2)>
<17, (18, 13, 11)>
<0, (14, 24, 2)>
<0, (14, 24, 8)>
<0, (24, 2, 22)>
<0, (24, 2, 13)>
<0, (24, 13, 12)>
<24, (0, 14, 19)>
<24, (0, 14, 20)>
<24, (14, 19, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
