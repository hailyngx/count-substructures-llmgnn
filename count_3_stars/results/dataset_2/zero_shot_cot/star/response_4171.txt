Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 21) (15, 3) (15, 18) (27, 29) (27, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 8) (1, 3) (1, 28) (1, 7) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 0) (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 7) (22, 26) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 17) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 3) (8, 12) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 21) (4, 16) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 25) (0, 18) (10, 6) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 4) (11, 2) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 25) (6, 22) (6, 10) (17, 22) (17, 16) (17, 28) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 19) (29, 26) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 7) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 20) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 17) (28, 20) (25, 5) (25, 0) (25, 24) (14, 20) (18, 15) (18, 0) (19, 12) (19, 7) (19, 16) (20, 27) (20, 16) (20, 28) (20, 14) (21, 26) (21, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are forming 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 28.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 22.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 16, and 23.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and 25.
5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 22, and (not forming a 3-star).
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and (not forming a 3-star).
7. Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 18, and (not forming a 3-star).
8. Node 17 is connected to nodes 16, 22, and 28.
9. Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 16.
10. Node 20 is connected to nodes 14, 16, and 27.
11. Node 21 is connected to nodes 4, 26, and (not forming a 3-star).
12. Node 24 is connected to nodes 11, 25, and (not forming a 3-star).

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars formed in the graph:
- There are 4 unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 7, 28)>, <2, (11, 13, 22)>, <4, (12, 16, 23)>, and <5, (0, 9, 25)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
