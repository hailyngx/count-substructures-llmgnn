Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes of degree 3 since the center of the 3-star must have 3 edges connected to it. The nodes of degree 3 in this graph are 0, 4, 6, and 8.

Now, let's determine the edges connected to these nodes:

- Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 0)
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0)
- Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 0)

From the analysis, we find the following 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 3, 4)>, <4, (9, 1, 8)>, <6, (9, 7, 3)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
