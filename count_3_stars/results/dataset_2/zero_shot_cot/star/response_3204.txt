Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 6) (5, 3) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 4) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes, which will form the 3-stars. 

The central nodes are: 1, 6, 9, 11, 14

For central node 1:
Adjacent nodes are: 0, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14
Possible 3-stars with central node 1: 
<1, (0, 6, 14)>
<1, (7, 9, 11)>
Total: 2

For central node 6:
Adjacent nodes are: 0, 3, 5, 8, 9, 14
Possible 3-stars with central node 6: 
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
Total: 1

For central node 9:
Adjacent nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11
Possible 3-stars with central node 9: 
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 10, 11)>
Total: 2

For central node 11:
Adjacent nodes are: 1, 7, 9, 10
Possible 3-stars with central node 11: 
<11, (1, 9, 7)>
<11, (9, 10, 7)>
Total: 2

For central node 14:
Adjacent nodes are: 0, 1, 12, 13, 6
Possible 3-stars with central node 14: 
<14, (0, 1, 12)>
Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 6, 14)>
<1, (7, 9, 11)>
<6, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (2, 10, 11)>
<11, (1, 9, 7)>
<11, (9, 10, 7)>
<14, (0, 1, 12)>
