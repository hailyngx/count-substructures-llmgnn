Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star should have 3 edges connected to it. Let's list all the possible 3-stars in this graph:

1. <6, (9, 1, 3)>
2. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
3. <9, (6, 8, 7)>
4. <9, (1, 4, 7)>
5. <4, (6, 9, 7)>
6. <4, (7, 0, 5)>
7. <7, (9, 4, 0)>
8. <7, (0, 3, 1)>
9. <2, (6, 4, -)>
10. <8, (9, 0, 3)>
11. <0, (9, 4, 8)>
12. <1, (6, 9, 5)>
13. <3, (6, 7, 8)>
14. <5, (4, 1, -)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
