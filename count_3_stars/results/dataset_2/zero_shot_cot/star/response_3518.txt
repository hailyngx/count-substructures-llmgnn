Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the center nodes in the graph. 

The degrees of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 4
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 3

From the degrees, we see that nodes 3 and 7 have a degree of 6, which means they are the center nodes. 

Next, let's find the leaf nodes connected to each center node. 

For node 3:
- Connected to nodes 9, 4, 8, 5, 0, 6

For node 7:
- Connected to nodes 9, 8, 6, 5, 0, 2

Now, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <3, (9, 4, 8)>
- <3, (5, 0, 6)>
- <7, (9, 8, 6)>
- <7, (5, 0, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
