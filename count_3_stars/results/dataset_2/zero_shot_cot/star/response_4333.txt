Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 19) (2, 3) (2, 12) (13, 16) (13, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (19, 17) (19, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (8, 1) (8, 15) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 8) (15, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 15) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can start by checking each node and its adjacent nodes to see if they form a 3-star. 

Counting the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 is connected to 3, 9, and 16 forming a 3-star <5, (3, 9, 16)>.
- Node 9 is connected to 5, 12, and 3 forming a 3-star <9, (5, 12, 3)>.
- Node 1 is connected to 3, 14, and 8 forming a 3-star <1, (3, 14, 8)>.
- Node 3 is already counted above.
