Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 1) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 19) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 17) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 19) (12, 4) (12, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 5) (17, 16) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 7) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 10) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (15, 5) (15, 17) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to the center with exactly three edges. These nodes will be the leaves of the 3-star graphs.

Nodes connected to the center with exactly three edges are:
- Node 1: (11, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (13, 1)
- Node 4: (16, 4), (4, 12), (4, 19)
- Node 5: (13, 5), (5, 18), (5, 15), (5, 10)
- Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 18), (9, 2)
- Node 10: (5, 10), (12, 10), (2, 10)

Next, let's form the 3-star graphs with the center and these nodes as leaves:
<1, (11, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1)>
<4, (16, 4), (4, 12), (4, 19)>
<5, (13, 5), (5, 18), (5, 15), (5, 10)>
<9, (9, 6), (9, 18), (9, 2)>
<10, (5, 10), (12, 10), (2, 10)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 5 different configurations. 
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
