Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find them:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 1. <5, (9, 6, 1)>
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8. <9, (5, 6, 8)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1. <6, (5, 9, 1)>
4. Node 4, node 7, node 8, and node 13 do not form 3-star structures because they have more or fewer than three connections.
5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 13. <10, (5, 6, 13)>
6. Node 11 is connected to node 8 and 13 but it doesn't form a 3-star structure.
7. Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 13. <12, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (5, 9, 1)>, and <10, (5, 6, 13)> with a total count of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
