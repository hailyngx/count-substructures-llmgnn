Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 7) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 1) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 11) (15, 8) (15, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 8) (4, 6) (4, 5) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 5) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 17) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 14) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 6, 6)>
<2, (1, 13, 11)>
<18, (14, 7, 7)>
<3, (16, 13, 19)>
<11, (2, 1, 1)>
<0, (16, 12, 12)>
<7, (18, 16, 19)>
<1, (6, 2, 11)>
<15, (8, 17, 17)>
<13, (2, 3, 17)>
<17, (15, 13, 16)>
<4, (6, 5, 5)>
<12, (0, 13, 17)>
<16, (3, 0, 7)>
<14, (18, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 12, 10)>
<8, (15, 17, 14)>
<10, (6, 5, 19)>
<19, (3, 7, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[20]
