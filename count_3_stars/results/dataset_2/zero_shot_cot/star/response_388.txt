Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 4) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 5) (13, 17) (13, 1) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 6) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 3) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 12) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 6) (14, 4) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. (2, 11, 7): This is a 3-star with node 2 as the central node and nodes 11 and 7 as the leaves.
2. (4, 1, 18): This is a 3-star with node 4 as the central node and nodes 1 and 18 as the leaves.
3. (4, 14, 16): This is a 3-star with node 4 as the central node and nodes 14 and 16 as the leaves.
4. (5, 0, 15): This is a 3-star with node 5 as the central node and nodes 0 and 15 as the leaves.
5. (6, 3, 12): This is a 3-star with node 6 as the central node and nodes 3 and 12 as the leaves.
6. (9, 3, 14): This is a 3-star with node 9 as the central node and nodes 3 and 14 as the leaves.
7. (9, 11, 3): This is a 3-star with node 9 as the central node and nodes 11 and 3 as the leaves.
8. (11, 2, 17): This is a 3-star with node 11 as the central node and nodes 2 and 17 as the leaves.
9. (14, 4, 9): This is a 3-star with node 14 as the central node and nodes 4 and 9 as the leaves.
10. (15, 5, 17): This is a 3-star with node 15 as the central node and nodes 5 and 17 as the leaves.
11. (16, 3, 4): This is a 3-star with node 16 as the central node and nodes 3 and 4 as the leaves.
12. (18, 7, 1): This is a 3-star with node 18 as the central node and nodes 7 and 1 as the leaves.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
