Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 2) (5, 19) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 18) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (12, 7) (12, 9) (13, 14) (13, 11) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 11) (18, 7) (18, 0) (18, 14) (16, 4) (16, 14) (16, 2) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 8) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 18.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 10.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 16.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 17.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 16.
- Node 5 is connected to only node 19.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 11, and 19.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 9, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 13, and 19.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 14, 11, and 19.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 18, and 13.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 2.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 8.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 0, and 14.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 11.

After examining the connections, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 18)>, <1, (0, 3, 10)>, <2, (3, 8, 16)>, <4, (7, 9, 16)>, <6, (14, 11, 19)>, <7, (4, 12, 18)>, <8, (2, 9, 10)>, <9, (4, 8, 12)>, <11, (6, 13, 19)>, <13, (14, 11, 19)>
  
Thus, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
