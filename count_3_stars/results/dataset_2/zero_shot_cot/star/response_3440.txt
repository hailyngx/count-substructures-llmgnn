Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-star configurations where one node is the center and the other three nodes are its connected leaves.

Calculating the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4

Observations:
- Nodes 0 and 1 do not have degrees high enough to form 3-star graphs.
- Nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 have degrees high enough to potentially be centers in 3-star graphs.

Based on this, we can identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph:
<2, (8, 4, 0)>
<2, (8, 6, 1)>
<2, (8, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<8, (5, 4, 0)>
<8, (5, 7, 1)>
<3, (9, 2, 4)>
<3, (9, 6, 7)>
<3, (9, 2, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 3)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<5, (6, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [(12)].
