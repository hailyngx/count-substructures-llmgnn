Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (17, 13) (17, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 13) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 3) (15, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 16) (3, 17) (3, 9) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (8, 10, 14)>
2. <1, (9, 11, 14)>
3. <2, (6, 14, 19)>
4. <3, (9, 13, 17)>
5. <4, (7, 11, 14)>
6. <5, (13, 5, 12)>
7. <6, (2, 11, 18)>
8. <8, (0, 7, 10)>
9. <9, (1, 3, 15)>
10. <11, (1, 4, 19)>
11. <12, (5, 13, 16)>
12. <13, (3, 5, 12)>
13. <14, (0, 4, 18)>
14. <16, (6, 12, 18)>
15. <17, (3, 13, 19)>
16. <18, (6, 14, 19)>
17. <19, (2, 11, 18)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
