Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each instance where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (5, 2, 6)>
<1, (5, 4, 0)>
<6, (4, 8, 3)>
<3, (4, 7, 6)>
<0, (9, 1, 3)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
