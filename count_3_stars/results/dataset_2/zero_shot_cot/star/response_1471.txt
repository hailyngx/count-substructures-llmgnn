Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 11) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (3, 4) (3, 11) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 12) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 14) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Based on the given edges list, the 3-star configurations are as follows:

<0, (8, 10, 13)>
<1, (10, 15, 18)>
<2, (11, 18, 19)>
<3, (4, 11, 13)>
<4, (3, 8, 11)>
<5, (11, 15, 6)>
<6, (15, 12, 17)>
<7, (9, 13, 14)>
<8, (0, 4, 10)>
<9, (7, 12, 17)>
<10, (0, 1, 14)>
<11, (2, 3, 5)>
<12, (6, 9, 15)>
<13, (0, 7, 19)>
<14, (10, 7, 9)>
<15, (1, 6, 12)>
<16, (7, 13, 18)>
<17, (6, 9, 11)>
<18, (2, 16, 1)>
<19, (2, 13, 15)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
