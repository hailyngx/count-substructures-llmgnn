Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with exactly 3 edges, as these could potentially be the central node of 3-stars.
Nodes with exactly 3 edges: 0, 6, 9

For each of these nodes, let's check if the connected nodes along the edges form a 3-star.

For node 0:
<0, (4, 2, 7)>

For node 6:
<6, (1, 8, 5)>

For node 9:
No 3-star can be formed as it only has 1 edge attached.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars: <0, (4, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 8, 5)>
