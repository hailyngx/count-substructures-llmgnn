Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 13) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 13) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 12) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 7) (12, 10) (19, 15) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 16) (17, 5) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 16) (8, 6) (8, 10) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 14) (7, 9) (7, 15) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (14, 16) (14, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three incident edges. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.
2. For each potential center, determine the nodes that are connected to it by edges, forming a 3-star.

Nodes with exactly three incident edges: 6, 18, 16, 14

<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<18, (2, 4, 3)>
<16, (17, 1, 5)>
<14, (13, 16, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
