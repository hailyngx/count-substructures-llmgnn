Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
1. Node 4 (neighbors: 7, 8, 9)
2. Node 6 (neighbors: 4, 9, 8)
3. Node 8 (neighbors: 4, 6, 9)
4. Node 9 (neighbors: 4, 6, 8)

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars formed by each central node.
1. Node 4: 1 unique 3-star <4, (7, 8, 9)>
2. Node 6: 1 unique 3-star <6, (4, 9, 8)>
3. Node 8: 1 unique 3-star <8, (4, 6, 9)>
4. Node 9: 1 unique 3-star <9, (4, 6, 8)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of 3-stars.
Total = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
