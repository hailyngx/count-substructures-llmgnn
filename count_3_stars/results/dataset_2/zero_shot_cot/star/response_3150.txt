Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's start by finding all the unique 3-stars. 

1. From node 5: <5, (9, 6, 12)>
2. From node 9: <9, (5, 6, 2)>
3. From node 4: <4, (7, 2, 10)>
4. From node 7: <7, (4, 6, 0)>
5. From node 6: <6, (5, 9, 7)>
6. From node 10: <10, (4, 13, 14)>
7. From node 11: <11, (3, 13, 12)>
8. From node 8: <8, (13, 0, 12)>
9. From node 13: <13, (10, 11, 8)>
10. From node 3: <3, (9, 6, 11)>
11. From node 0: <0, (7, 6, 8)>
12. From node 1: <1, (4, 14, 2)>
13. From node 2: <2, (9, 4, 7)>
14. From node 14: <14, (5, 9, 4)>
15. From node 12: <12, (5, 11, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars found: 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
