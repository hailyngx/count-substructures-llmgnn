Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 15) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 5) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<6, (7, 13, 8)>
<3, (14, 11, 2)>
<5, (17, 6, 8)>
<11, (2, 11, 14)>
<13, (10, 11, 13)>
<16, (9, 16, 3)>
