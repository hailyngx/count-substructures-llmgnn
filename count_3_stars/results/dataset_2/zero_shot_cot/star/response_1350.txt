Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (3, 1) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 17) (15, 5) (15, 9) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 13) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 10) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 4) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 0) (6, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 16) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph. 

The nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 12, and 16.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 11, and 19.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7 and 15.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 18, and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 11, and 16.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 11, 14, and 15.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 8, and 16.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9, and 18.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2 and 17.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4 and 17.
- Node 14 is connected to node 9.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 10.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 13.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 11.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7.

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (2, 3, 19)>
<1, (2, 10, 16)>
<2, (1, 10, 16)>
<4, (9, 10, 11)>
<7, (5, 18, 19)>
<8, (6, 10, 16)>
<9, (0, 11, 15)>
<10, (2, 4, 16)>
<11, (4, 8, 18)>
<15, (5, 9, 17)>
<16, (2, 8, 10)>
<17, (7, 12, 13)>
<18, (7, 11, 17)>
<19, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
