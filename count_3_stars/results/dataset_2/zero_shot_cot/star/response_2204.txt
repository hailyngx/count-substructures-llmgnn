Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 8) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (17, 4) (17, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would represent the center node of potential 3-stars. 

Nodes with degree 3: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16

Now, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (15, 19, 13)>
<3, (15, 5, 0)>
<4, (7, 17, 12)>
<5, (3, 19, 0)>
<7, (4, 19, 10)>
<9, (15, 14, 12)>
<10, (7, 19, 18)>
<11, (16, 19, 1)>
<13, (2, 14, 19)>
<14, (16, 1, 9)>
<16, (11, 18, 14)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
