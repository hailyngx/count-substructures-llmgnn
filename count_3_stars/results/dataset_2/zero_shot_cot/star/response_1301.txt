Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

1. Nodes connected to node 5: 
<5, (6, 4, 10)>
<6, (5, 9, 12)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>

2. Nodes connected to node 9: 
<9, (6, 10, 1)>
<6, (9, 5, 12)>
<10, (9, 1, 5)>

3. Nodes connected to node 6: 
<6, (5, 9, 12)>
<5, (6, 4, 10)>
<12, (6, 8, 0)>

4. Nodes connected to node 4: 
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 10)>
<7, (4, 3, 2)>

5. Nodes connected to node 7: 
<7, (4, 3, 2)>
<4, (7, 5, 8)>
<3, (7, 8, 0)>

6. Nodes connected to node 8: 
<8, (4, 7, 12)>
<4, (8, 5, 7)>
<12, (8, 6, 0)>

7. Nodes connected to node 11: 
<11, (4, 14, 0)>
<4, (11, 7, 0)>
<14, (11, 1, 2)>

8. Nodes connected to node 14: 
<14, (8, 11, 1)>
<8, (14, 12, 4)>
<11, (14, 2, 0)>

9. Nodes connected to node 3: 
<3, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (3, 4, 2)>
<8, (3, 12, 4)>

10. Nodes connected to node 0: 
<0, (9, 3, 11)>
<9, (0, 6, 1)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>

11. Nodes connected to node 1: 
<1, (9, 14, 2)>
<9, (1, 6, 10)>
<14, (1, 11, 2)>

12. Nodes connected to node 2: 
<2, (7, 11, 14)>
<7, (2, 4, 3)>
<11, (2, 14, 0)>

13. Nodes connected to node 12: 
<12, (8, 6, 0)>
<8, (12, 4, 14)>
<6, (12, 9, 5)>

14. Nodes connected to node 13: 
<13, (3, 12, -)>
<3, (13, 7, -)>
<12, (13, 8, -)>

15. Nodes connected to node 10: 
<10, (9, 1, 5)>
<9, (10, 6, 1)>
<1, (10, 14, 2)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
