Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 5) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (9, 17) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 14) (1, 14) (1, 17) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 10) (19, 2) (19, 12) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 4) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's denote the nodes connected in each edge:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 14, 14.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 14, 17.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 16, 6, 8, 7, 19.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 13, 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 13, 5, 12, 10.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 16, 4, 10, 18.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 2, 18.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 14, 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 18.
- Node 9 is connected to node 17.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 14, 0, 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 11, 17, 19, 4.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 16, 10.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 17, 0, 1, 7.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 13, 2, 5.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 1, 12, 9.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 5.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 2, 12.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph and count them: 
<2, (16, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 10, 12)>
<5, (16, 4, 18)>
<6, (10, 2, 18)>
<10, (5, 6, 13)>
<11, (16, 14, 0)>
<12, (4, 11, 19)>
<13, (3, 10, 16)>
<14, (11, 17, 0)>
<16, (2, 5, 11)>
<17, (1, 12, 14)>
<18, (5, 6, 8)>
<19, (2, 12, 4)>

Therefore, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
