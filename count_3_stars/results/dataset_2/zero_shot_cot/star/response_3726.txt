Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
There are [<3>] 3-stars in the given graph.
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
