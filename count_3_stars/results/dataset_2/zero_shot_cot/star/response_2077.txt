Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 13) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 19) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 17) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 10) (12, 2) (12, 17) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 14) (15, 8) (15, 13) (9, 11) (9, 16) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars.

Nodes with degrees:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 5
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2
- Node 10: 2
- Node 11: 4
- Node 12: 2
- Node 13: 4
- Node 14: 3
- Node 15: 2
- Node 16: 2
- Node 17: 3
- Node 18: 4
- Node 19: 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars.
[<3, (2, 0, 18)>, <6, (2, 5, 14)>, <13, (0, 17, 13)>, <17, (17, 0, 12)>] 

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
