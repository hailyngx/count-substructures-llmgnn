Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 8) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (15, 18) (15, 1) (9, 11) (9, 17) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (2, 11) (2, 17) 

Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
Since a 3-star consists of a center node and three leaves connected to the center, we need to find nodes that form this structure. Let's go through each node:
- Node 0: (0, 14, 10), (0, 3, 19)
- Node 1: (1, 6, 15), (1, 16, 13)
- Node 2: (2, 11, 17)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 12), (3, 8, 13)
- Node 4: (4, 18, 13)
- Node 5: (5, 6, 14), (5, 7, 10)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 10)
- Node 7: (7, 5, 10)
- Node 8: (8, 11, 16)
- Node 9: (9, 11, 17)
- Node 10: (10, 0, 14)
- Node 11: (11, 9, 17)
- Node 12: (12, 3, 17)
- Node 13: (13, 4, 16)
- Node 14: (14, 0, 5)
- Node 15: (15, 1, 18)
- Node 16: (16, 1, 8)
- Node 17: (17, 2, 11)
- Node 18: (18, 4, 15)
- Node 19: (19, 0, 3)

There are a total of 20 unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (14, 10, 3)>, <1, (6, 15, 16)>, <1, (16, 13, 6)>, <2, (11, 17, 2)>, <3, (0, 12, 8)>, <4, (18, 13, 16)>, <5, (6, 14, 7)>, <5, (7, 10, 14)>, <6, (1, 10, 5)>, <7, (5, 10, 14)>, <8, (11, 16, 3)>, <9, (11, 17, 17)>, <10, (0, 14, 5)>, <11, (9, 17, 17)>, <12, (3, 17, 12)>, <13, (4, 16, 13)>, <14, (0, 5, 10)>, <15, (1, 18, 16)>, <16, (1, 8, 13)>, <17, (2, 11, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
