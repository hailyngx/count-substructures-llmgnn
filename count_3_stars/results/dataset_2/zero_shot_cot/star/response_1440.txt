Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 11) (17, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 5) (18, 2) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 1) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 8) (15, 11) (15, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <11, (16, 13, 4)>
2. <16, (11, 7, 1)>
3. <5, (9, 18, 3)>
4. <9, (5, 6, 8)>
5. <14, (17, 7, -)>
6. <-, (14, 7, 6)>
7. <2, (18, 19, 13)>
8. <18, (5, 2, -)>
9. <7, (16, 14, 6)>
10. <12, (7, 13, -)>
11. <0, (1, -, -)>
12. <19, (2, 10, -)>
13. <8, (9, 3, 1)>
14. <13, (11, 16, 2)>
15. <10, (5, 19, 4)>
16. <3, (5, 6, 8)>
17. <1, (16, 0, 8)>
18. <15, (11, 9, -)>
19. <4, (11, 16, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
