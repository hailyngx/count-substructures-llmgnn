Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 6, 12)>
<9, (5, 8, 11)>
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<4, (6, 14, -)>
<14, (5, 9, 4)>
<13, (6, 7, 12)>
<3, (0, 10, -)>
<11, (5, 9, 0)>
<12, (5, 13, 10)>
<1, (6, 7, 0)>
<2, (6, 0, 10)>
<0, (14, 3, 11)>
<7, (13, 1, 8)>
<8, (9, 5, 7)>
<10, (3, 13, 2)>

Now, count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
[13]
