Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we are looking for nodes that are connected to 3 other nodes forming a star pattern.

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes: 9, 10, 12, 8.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes: 6, 11, 12.
- Node 1 is connected to 2 nodes: 3, 10.
- Node 3 is connected to 5 nodes: 1, 0, 14, 10, 5.
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes: 7, 8, 13.
- Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes: 4, 0, 14, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to 5 nodes: 6, 4, 7, 2, 12.
- Node 0 is connected to 5 nodes: 3, 7, 14, 11, 5.
- Node 14 is connected to 4 nodes: 3, 7, 0, 5.
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes: 8, 13, 10.
- Node 5 is connected to 6 nodes: 3, 0, 14, 13, 12, 11.
- Node 13 is connected to 4 nodes: 4, 2, 5, 11.
- Node 11 is connected to 4 nodes: 9, 0, 5, 13.
- Node 12 is connected to 4 nodes: 6, 9, 8, 5.
- Node 10 is connected to 4 nodes: 6, 1, 3, 2.

Based on the analysis above, we can see that nodes 9, 4, and 2 form 3-stars. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars in the graph: <<9, (6, 11, 12)>, <4, (7, 8, 13)>, <2, (8, 10, 13)>].
