Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the unique 3-stars present.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (14, 2, 10)>
<1, (12, 2, 13)>
<2, (5, 14, 12)>
<3, (9, 11, 13)>
<4, (14, 1, 10)>
<5, (6, 11, 10)>
<6, (12, 8, 5)>
<7, (11, 5, 13)>

Now, once we have identified the unique 3-stars, we count how many instances of each unique 3-star are present in the graph:

<0, (14, 2, 10)> appears twice.
<1, (12, 2, 13)> appears once.
<2, (5, 14, 12)> appears once.
<3, (9, 11, 13)> appears once.
<4, (14, 1, 10)> appears once.
<5, (6, 11, 10)> appears once.
<6, (12, 8, 5)> appears once.
<7, (11, 5, 13)> appears once.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
