Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (25, 5) (25, 21) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (7, 2) (12, 24) (12, 19) (19, 12) (19, 24) (26, 23) (26, 5) (26, 11) (5, 25) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 21) (13, 23) (13, 9) (28, 0) (28, 14) (28, 18) (28, 15) (9, 13) (9, 24) (9, 1) (29, 27) (29, 16) (29, 0) (27, 29) (27, 11) (27, 2) (18, 28) (18, 21) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 8) (17, 23) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 24) (8, 20) (8, 21) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 15) (16, 29) (16, 17) (16, 1) (20, 8) (20, 21) (24, 12) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 8) (15, 28) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 4) (21, 25) (21, 5) (21, 18) (21, 8) (21, 20) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 28) (14, 1) (11, 26) (11, 27) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 27) (2, 10) (4, 15) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's look for all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <5, (25, 26, 8)>
- <6, (3, 17, 15)>
- <9, (13, 24, 1)>
- <10, (22, 4, 2)>
- <11, (26, 27, -)>
- <12, (19, 24, -)>
- <13, (23, 9, -)>
- <16, (29, 17, 1)>
- <18, (21, 28, -)>
- <19, (24, 12, -)>
- <20, (21, 8, -)>
- <21, (25, 5, 18)>
- <23, (22, 26, 17)>
- <24, (9, 12, 8)>
- <25, (5, 21, -)>
- <27, (29, 11, 2)>
- <28, (0, 15, 14)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]
