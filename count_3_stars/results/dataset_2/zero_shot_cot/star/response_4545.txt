Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars step-by-step:
1. Node 9 with nodes 5, 6, 4: <9, (5, 6, 4)>
2. Node 4 with nodes 9, 12, 6: <4, (9, 12, 6)>
3. Node 6 with nodes 9, 10, 4: <6, (9, 10, 4)>
4. Node 10 with nodes 6, 11, 8: <10, (6, 11, 8)>
5. Node 11 with nodes 10, 3, 1: <11, (10, 3, 1)>
6. Node 12 with nodes 4, 13, 14: <12, (4, 13, 14)>
7. Node 3 with nodes 4, 11, 13: <3, (4, 11, 13)>
8. Node 0 with nodes 5, 7, 8: <0, (5, 7, 8)>
9. Node 14 with nodes 12, 13, 2: <14, (12, 13, 2)>
10. Node 1 with nodes 9, 11, 8: <1, (9, 11, 8)>

Now we have listed all unique 3-stars in the given graph. By counting them, we get a total of [10] 3-stars.
