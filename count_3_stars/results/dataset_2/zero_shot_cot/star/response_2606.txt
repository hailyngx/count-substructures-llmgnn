Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 17) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 2) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 14) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (1, 16) (1, 15) (1, 4) (9, 15) (9, 17) (0, 11) (0, 10) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (17, 9) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 12) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 19) (12, 6) (12, 19) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's analyze the given edges:

1. Central node 11: (11, 16), (11, 0), (11, 15)
2. Central node 16: (16, 11), (16, 1), (16, 6)
3. Central node 3: (3, 15), (3, 7), (3, 17)
4. Central node 15: (15, 11), (15, 3), (15, 1)
5. Central node 10: (10, 0), (10, 7), (10, 2)
6. Central node 8: (8, 13), (8, 18)
7. Central node 13: (13, 8), (13, 5), (13, 4)
8. Central node 4: (4, 13), (4, 18), (4, 1)
9. Central node 18: (18, 8), (18, 4), (18, 14)
10. Central node 5: (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 14)
11. Central node 1: (1, 16), (1, 15), (1, 4)
12. Central node 9: (9, 15), (9, 17)
13. Central node 0: (0, 11), (0, 10)
14. Central node 7: (7, 3), (7, 10), (7, 6)
15. Central node 2: (2, 15), (2, 10), (2, 5)
16. Central node 17: (17, 3), (17, 4), (17, 9)
17. Central node 6: (6, 16), (6, 7), (6, 12)
18. Central node 14: (14, 18), (14, 5), (14, 19)
19. Central node 12: (12, 6), (12, 19)
20. Central node 19: (19, 13), (19, 14), (19, 12)

Now, we list the unique 3-stars: 
<11, (16, 0, 15)>
<16, (11, 1, 6)>
<3, (15, 7, 17)>
<15, (11, 3, 1)>
<10, (0, 7, 2)>
<8, (13, 18, -)>
<13, (8, 5, 4)>
<4, (13, 18, 1)>
<18, (8, 4, 14)>
<5, (13, 2, 14)>
<1, (16, 15, 4)>
<9, (15, 17, -)>
<0, (11, 10, -)>
<7, (3, 10, 6)>
<2, (15, 10, 5)>
<17, (3, 4, 9)>
<6, (16, 7, 12)>
<14, (18, 5, 19)>
<12, (6, 19, -)>
<19, (13, 14, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
