Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 8) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 0) (18, 8) (18, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 15) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (19, 10) (19, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 12)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 12)>
<7, (6, 10, 16)>
<8, (5, 13, 17)>
<10, (7, 11, 15)>
<11, (0, 10, 19)>
<12, (3, 6, 13)>
<13, (8, 12, 17)>
<14, (15, 17, 10)>
<15, (1, 10, 14)>
<16, (2, 7, 17)>
<17, (13, 14, 16)>
<18, (7, 8, 19)>
<19, (11, 18, 10)>

Now, we need to count the number of unique 3-stars. 

There are [17] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
