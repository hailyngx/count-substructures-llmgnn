Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 15) (16, 14) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 14) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 0) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 25) (29, 0) (29, 25) (29, 21) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 11) (8, 28) (8, 26) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 23) (27, 24) (27, 20) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 13) (26, 6) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 17) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 12) (5, 11) (5, 23) (5, 12) (19, 6) (19, 17) (10, 18) (10, 21) (21, 29) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 24) (23, 28) (23, 5) (20, 3) (20, 27) (20, 24) (24, 27) (24, 21) (24, 20) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (13, 18) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 7) (17, 19) (25, 22) (25, 29) (25, 21) 

Response:
There are three steps to solve this problem.

Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
In this graph, we need to find nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 16: (11, 16), (16, 28), (16, 15), (16, 14)
- Node 15: (15, 16), (15, 1), (15, 14)
- Node 14: (14, 16), (14, 22), (14, 26), (14, 12)
- Node 26: (6, 26), (18, 26), (8, 26), (14, 26)
- Node 18: (18, 22), (18, 26), (18, 10), (18, 1)
- Node 21: (29, 21), (10, 21), (21, 25), (21, 24)

Step 2: Form all possible 3-stars using the identified nodes.
Now, we form all possible 3-stars using the identified nodes from Step 1.

The unique 3-stars are:
<16, (11, 5, 8)>
<15, (16, 1, 14)>
<14, (16, 22, 26)>
<26, (6, 18, 8)>
<18, (22, 10, 1)>
<21, (29, 10, 25)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
Counting the unique 3-stars found in Step 2, we get a total of [6] 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
