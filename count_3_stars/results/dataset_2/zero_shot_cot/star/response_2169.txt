Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 6) (7, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (1, 4) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- <6, (9, 2, 12)>
- <4, (8, 13, 1)>
- <8, (4, 2, 5)>
- <2, (6, 9, 8)>
- <0, (14, 3, 5)>
- <14, (0, 4, 3)>
- <3, (9, 0, 11)>
- <11, (6, 9, 3)>
- <12, (6, 2, 10)>
- <7, (6, 10, 7)>
- <5, (4, 8, 2)>
- <1, (4, 14, 13)>
- <10, (9, 8, 3)>
- <13, (6, 4, 10)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
