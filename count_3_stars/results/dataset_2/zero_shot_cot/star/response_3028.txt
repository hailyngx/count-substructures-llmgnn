Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. (1, 6, 9)
2. (2, 5, 7)
3. (3, 0, 4)

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (6, 9, 1)>, <2, (5, 7, 2)>, <3, (0, 4, 3)>
