Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 29) (22, 15) (22, 11) (1, 21) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 23) (21, 2) (21, 15) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 20) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 18) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) (28, 1) (28, 20) (28, 16) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 19) (29, 24) (2, 21) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (26, 24) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 4) (24, 18) (5, 8) (5, 27) (19, 29) (19, 25) (15, 22) (15, 21) (15, 10) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 2) (16, 28) (16, 6) (4, 2) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 4) (25, 0) (25, 19) (25, 27) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 14) (7, 10) (7, 6) (11, 22) (11, 20) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 23) (6, 16) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 23) (14, 20) (14, 27) (18, 0) (18, 24) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 6) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph:

First, let's count the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 15, and 2.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 15.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 21, 10, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 24, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 17, and 4.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 12, 29, and an additional node.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 21, 4, and 3.
- Node 10 and 10 only have 3 connections, but since there is an extra connection, we exclude it.

Now let's analyze the connections of Node 13: 
- Node 13 has connections to 12, 29, and an additional node. 
- Concerning node 29, it is connected to nodes 10, 19, 24, and 13.
- Since node 29 is connected to node 13, we eliminate the connection between nodes 29 and 13, leading to node 19 as the third connection.
- So the 3-star with node 13 at the center is <13, (12, 29, 19)>.

Next, let's analyze the connections of Node 21: 
- Node 21 has connections to 1, 9, and 15. 
- Among these, only node 15 is not already part of a 3-star graph.
- So, the 3-star with node 21 at the center is <21, (1, 9, 15)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [2].
