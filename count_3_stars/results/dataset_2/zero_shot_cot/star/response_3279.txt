Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 10) (2, 19) (2, 9) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 18) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 15) (0, 12) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 14.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 17, 12, and 18.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 8, 11, and 14.

Now we can count the number of unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 9, 13)>
<7, (4, 10, 14)>
<16, (17, 12, 18)>
<19, (8, 11, 14)>
