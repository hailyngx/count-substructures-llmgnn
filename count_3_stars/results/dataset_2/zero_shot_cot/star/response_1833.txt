Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. This can be done by finding the nodes that are connected to a single node (the center) with three edges. 

After examining the edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 12, 14)>
<9, (6, 13, 14)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (4, 10, 11)>
<10, (7, 0, 11)>
<11, (7, 10, 14)>
<1, (7, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 0, 2)>
<8, (4, 2, 2)>
<12, (6, 7, 14)>
<0, (6, 1, 3)>
<14, (6, 11, 13)>

Counting them, we find a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
