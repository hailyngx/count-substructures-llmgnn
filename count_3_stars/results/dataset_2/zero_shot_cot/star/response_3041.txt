Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 1) (14, 0) (14, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 18) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 14) (3, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (19, 16) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 13) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 15) (6, 18) (6, 15) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 16) 

Response:
This is how we can find the number of 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. Identify the nodes with three or more edges connected to them. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.
2. For each potential center node, count the number of 3-stars it can form by selecting three connected nodes as leaves.
3. Output the total count of unique 3-stars found.

Let's follow these steps:

1. Nodes with three or more edges connected: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18
2. Counting the number of 3-stars for each potential center:
   - Node 0: (2, 4, 18), (4, 10, 16), (16, 0, 18) [<0, (2, 4, 18)>, <0, (4, 10, 16)>, <0, (16, 0, 18)>]
   - Node 1: (5, 9, 16) [<1, (5, 9, 16)>]
   - Node 2: (0, 12, 18), (12, 2, 13) [<2, (0, 12, 18)>, <2, (12, 2, 13)>]
   - Node 3: (7, 13, 15) [<3, (7, 13, 15)>]
   - Node 4: (0, 10, 13) [<4, (0, 10, 13)>]
   - Node 5: (1, 9, 13) [<5, (1, 9, 13)>]
   - Node 7: (3, 13, 15), (8, 15, 18), (13, 4, 7) [<7, (3, 13, 15)>, <7, (8, 15, 18)>, <7, (13, 4, 7)>]
   - Node 9: (1, 5, 13) [<9, (1, 5, 13)>]
   - Node 12: (2, 13, 17) [<12, (2, 13, 17)>]
   - Node 13: (4, 7, 15) [<13, (4, 7, 15)>]
   - Node 14: (0, 3, 7) [<14, (0, 3, 7)>]
   - Node 16: (0, 1, 19) [<16, (0, 1, 19)>]
   - Node 18: (2, 6, 7) [<18, (2, 6, 7)>]

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 4, 18)>, <0, (4, 10, 16)>, <0, (16, 0, 18)>, <1, (5, 9, 16)>, <2, (0, 12, 18)>, <2, (12, 2, 13)>, <3, (7, 13, 15)>, <4, (0, 10, 13)>, <5, (1, 9, 13)>, <7, (3, 13, 15)>, <7, (8, 15, 18)>, <7, (13, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 13)>, <12, (2, 13, 17)>, <13, (4, 7, 15)>, <14, (0, 3, 7)>, <16, (0, 1, 19)>, <18, (2, 6, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [17].
