Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

In this graph, each unique 3-star can be represented as <central_node, (leaf_1, leaf_2, leaf_3)>.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
- <5, (8, 1, 4)>
- <9, (6, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 3, 7)>
- <8, (5, 1, 7)>
- <1, (5, 6, 2)>
- <7, (5, 9, 2)>
- <0, (6, 2, 1)>
- <3, (6, 2, 7)>
- <4, (5, 9, 6)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
