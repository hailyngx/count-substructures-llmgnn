Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 12) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 14) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (12, 0) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 7) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the connections for each node:
- Node 0: (0, 8), (0, 13), (0, 12) -> <0, (8, 13, 12)>
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 10), (1, 8) -> <1, (3, 11, 10)>
- Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 5), (2, 7) -> <2, (6, 8, 13)>
- Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 14), (3, 4) -> <3, (6, 1, 14)>
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 13), (4, 10) -> <4, (3, 13, 10)>
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 11), (5, 10), (5, 7) -> <5, (6, 2, 11)>
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 11) -> <6, (9, 5, 10)>
- Node 7: (7, 13), (7, 5), (7, 2), (7, 11), (7, 14) -> <7, (13, 5, 11)>
- Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 0) -> <8, (9, 1, 2)>
- Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 14), (9, 13) -> <9, (6, 8, 14)>
- Node 10: (10, 6), (10, 1), (10, 5), (10, 4) -> <10, (6, 1, 5)>
- Node 11: (11, 6), (11, 1), (11, 5), (11, 7) -> <11, (6, 1, 5)>
- Node 12: (12, 0) -> No 3-star
- Node 13: (13, 9), (13, 4), (13, 2), (13, 0), (13, 7) -> <13, (9, 4, 2)>
- Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 3), (14, 7) -> <14, (9, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (8, 13, 12)>, <1, (3, 11, 10)>, <2, (6, 8, 13)>, <3, (6, 1, 14)>, <4, (3, 13, 10)>, <5, (6, 2, 11)>, <6, (9, 5, 10)>, <7, (13, 5, 11)>, <8, (9, 1, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 14)>, <10, (6, 1, 5)>, <11, (6, 1, 5)>, <13, (9, 4, 2)>, <14, (9, 3, 7)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [14]
