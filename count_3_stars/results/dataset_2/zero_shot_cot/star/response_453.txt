Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (17, 0) (17, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 0) (16, 15) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (6, 17) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 10) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (19, 13) (19, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure.

Nodes with the degree of 3 are: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19.

Now, let's check which of these nodes are the center of a 3-star. 
<0, (7, 13, 16)>
<2, (5, 12, 19)>
<3, (7, 12, 6)>
<8, (0, 15, 14)>
<9, (4, 10, 11)>
<10, (15, 18, 9)>
<13, (5, 19, 18)>
<14, (4, 2, 8)>
<15, (10, 16, 8)>
<16, (0, 15, 18)>
<18, (13, 10, 19)>
<19, (13, 2, 18)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars found, we get a total of [12].
