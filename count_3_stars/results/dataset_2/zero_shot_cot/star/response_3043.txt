Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that has exactly three edges connected to it, which forms a 3-star. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (10, 7, 14)>
<1, (3, 0, 1)>
<2, (10, 7, 14)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 11, 12)>
<6, (3, 9, 13)>
<7, (2, 0, 14)>
<8, (3, 7, 13)>
<10, (0, 2, 14)>
<11, (5, 10, 13)>
<12, (5, 13, 8)>
<13, (11, 12, 8)>
<14, (0, 2, 10)>

The unique 3-stars have been listed above. By counting the unique 3-stars found, we can see that there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
