Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0: (0, 1, 7), (0, 1, 9), (0, 7, 6)
2. Node 1: (1, 0, 7), (1, 0, 3), (1, 3, 8)
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 4), (2, 4, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 7), (3, 7, 6), (3, 6, 4)
5. Node 4: (4, 2, 9), (4, 6, 9), (4, 6, 1)
6. Node 5: No 3-star
7. Node 6: (6, 3, 7), (6, 7, 0), (6, 7, 1), (6, 9, 4)
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 1), (7, 0, 6), (7, 1, 3), (7, 3, 6)
9. Node 8: (8, 1, 3), (8, 3, 5), (8, 5, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 6, 7), (9, 7, 1), (9, 1, 2)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 5, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [8]
