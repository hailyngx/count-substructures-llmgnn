Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (9, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 4, 5, 7
   <0, (4, 5, 7)>

2. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 4, 5, 6
   <3, (4, 5, 6)>

3. Central node: 6
   Leaves: 4, 5, 7
   <6, (4, 5, 7)>

4. Central node: 7
   Leaves: 0, 1, 6
   <7, (0, 1, 6)>
