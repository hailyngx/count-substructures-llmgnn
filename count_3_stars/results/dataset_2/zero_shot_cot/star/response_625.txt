Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 18) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 17) (12, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 15) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 19) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 4) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 2) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are part of the 3-stars. For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it must be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 7, 13, 14, 19.

Next, we need to find the pairs of nodes that are connected to each of these selected nodes. If we find three such pairs for a selected node, then it forms a 3-star with that node as the center.

After analyzing the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<0, (6, 15, 2)>
<1, (8, 15, 18)>
<7, (3, 10, 17)>
<13, (10, 0, 19)>

So, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
