Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 14) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since each 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes, we will identify them one by one.

Let's begin by listing the 3-star structures in the graph:

<1, (2, 12, 13)>
<3, (0, 8, 11)>
<5, (2, 10, 14)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the answer is [4].
