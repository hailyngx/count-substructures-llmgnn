Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 7) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 26) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 25) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 14) (17, 19) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 4) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 7) (28, 21) (28, 3) (29, 3) (29, 12) (2, 19) (8, 10) (8, 26) (21, 28) (21, 12) (24, 18) (24, 5) (24, 20) (26, 15) (26, 0) (26, 8) (26, 23) (22, 14) (3, 28) (3, 29) (3, 7) (4, 16) (4, 6) (23, 6) (23, 26) (7, 27) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 20) (13, 12) (13, 19) (20, 6) (20, 9) (20, 24) (20, 1) (20, 10) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 25) (12, 29) (12, 21) (12, 13) (10, 27) (10, 8) (10, 20) (5, 16) (5, 24) (5, 25) (25, 14) (25, 19) (25, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first locate all nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly 3 incident edges are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 16, 21, 22, 23, 28, 29

Now, we will find the 3-stars with these nodes as the center.
After analyzing the provided edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (20, 7, 11)>
<2, (19, 17, 13)>
<3, (28, 29, 7)>
<4, (6, 16, 5)>
<5, (16, 24, 25)>
<6, (4, 9, 20)>
<9, (6, 29, 7)>
<12, (13, 21, 29)>
<13, (19, 12, 25)>
<16, (11, 5, 24)>
<21, (12, 3, 28)>
<22, (14, 19, 25)>
<23, (6, 26, 3)>
<28, (21, 3, 12)>
<29, (3, 9, 12)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
