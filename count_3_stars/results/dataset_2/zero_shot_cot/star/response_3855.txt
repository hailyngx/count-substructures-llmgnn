Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (17, 10) (17, 11) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 0) (4, 13) (4, 19) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 19) (16, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 15) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 13, 2, 19
- Node 1: 11, 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 1, 0, 19
- Node 3: 7, 12, 9
- Node 4: 13, 19, 16
- Node 5: 1, 18, 19, 14
- Node 6: 12, 1, 15
- Node 7: 10, 12, 3, 9
- Node 8: 13
- Node 9: 7, 18, 3
- Node 10: 11, 17, 7
- Node 11: 10, 1, 17, 15
- Node 12: 7, 6, 14, 3
- Node 13: 8, 4, 14, 0
- Node 14: 13, 12, 5
- Node 15: 11, 6
- Node 16: 4
- Node 17: 10, 11
- Node 18: 5, 9
- Node 19: 2, 4, 5, 0

Now we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are 2 unique 3-stars:
<13, (8, 4, 14)>
<1, (11, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
