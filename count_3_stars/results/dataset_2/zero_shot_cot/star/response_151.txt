Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (9, 6, 3)>
2. <7, (4, 5, 3)>
3. <1, (9, 4, 3)>
4. <9, (5, 8, 2)>
5. <4, (7, 1, 2)>
6. <6, (5, 7, 1)>
7. <3, (5, 7, 1)>
8. <8, (9, 7, 2)>
9. <2, (9, 4, 1)>
10. <0, (7, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
