Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (8, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars by observing that there are 2 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
