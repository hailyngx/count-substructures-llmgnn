Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 15) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 18) (9, 2) (9, 7) (3, 4) (7, 9) (7, 10) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 4) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 11) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (12, 19) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 16) 

Response:
The center nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are nodes 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, and 19. Let's count the number of unique 3-stars for each of these central nodes.

For node 5:
- <5, (18, 15, 10)>
Total: 1

For node 6:
- <6, (14, 19, 4)>
Total: 1

For node 10:
- <10, (7, 5, 16)>
Total: 1

For node 11:
- <11, (18, 19, 0)>
- <11, (17, 19, 0)>
Total: 2

For node 14:
- <14, (6, 16, 8)>
Total: 1

For node 15:
- <15, (17, 0, 13)>
- <15, (18, 13, 8)>
Total: 2

For node 17:
- <17, (11, 19, 15)>
Total: 1

For node 19:
- <19, (12, 11, 6)>
Total: 1

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
