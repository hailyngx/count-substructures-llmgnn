Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 1) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three incident edges.

The nodes with exactly three incident edges are: 1, 3, 8, and 14.

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:

For node 1, the leaves are: 7, 14, 11.
For node 3, the leaves are: 5, 8, 10.
For node 8, the leaves are: 2, 12, 3.
For node 14, the leaves are: 2, 1, 9.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (7, 14, 11)>
<3, (5, 8, 10)>
<8, (2, 12, 3)>
<14, (2, 1, 9)>
