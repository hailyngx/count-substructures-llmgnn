Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 0) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 12, 6
Node 5: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 15
Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 5, 0
Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 0, 11
Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 19, 10
Node 11: Connected to nodes 7, 15, 8
Node 12: Connected to nodes 4, 9, 11
Node 13: Connected to nodes 1, 15, 18
Node 15: Connected to nodes 5, 11, 13
Node 16: Connected to nodes 17, 1, 16
Node 17: Connected to nodes 14, 1, 16
Node 18: Connected to nodes 15, 19, 13
Node 19: Connected to nodes 8, 18, 10

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 12, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 15)>
<6, (4, 5, 0)>
<7, (4, 0, 11)>
<8, (5, 19, 10)>
<11, (7, 15, 8)>
<12, (4, 9, 11)>
<13, (1, 15, 18)>
<15, (5, 11, 13)>
<16, (17, 1, 16)>
<17, (14, 1, 16)>
<18, (15, 19, 13)>
<19, (8, 18, 10)>

Since we have listed out all the unique 3-stars in the graph, we can count the total number of 3-stars we found inside brackets:
