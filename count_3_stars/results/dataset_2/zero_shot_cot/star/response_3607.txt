Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 17) (9, 13) (18, 1) (18, 13) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 17) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, we need to find the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the central nodes in the graph by finding nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.

The candidate central nodes are: 3, 15, 5, 19, 1, 9, 17, and 13.

Next, we can identify the 3-stars by looking at each candidate central node and checking the nodes connected to them.

For the given graph, the unique 3-stars are:
<3, (2, 8, 12)>
<15, (1, 3, 16)>
<5, (2, 7, 12)>
<19, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (9, 15, 16)>
<9, (1, 13, 17)>
<17, (4, 7, 16)>
<13, (9, 18, 19)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph. [8]
