Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes connected to each node, which forms potential 3-stars. Then we can check each potential 3-star to see if it meets the definition of a 3-star graph.

Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 3), Potential 3-stars: {<0, (3, 8, 9)>}
Node 1: (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), Potential 3-stars: {<1, (4, 6, 7)>}
Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), Potential 3-stars: {<2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>}
Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 9), Potential 3-stars: {<3, (0, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>}
Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), Potential 3-stars: {<4, (1, 6, 7)>}
Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), Potential 3-stars: {<5, (2, 6, 8)>}
Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 9), Potential 3-stars: {<6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 9)>}
Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 9), Potential 3-stars: {<7, (4, 5, 9)>}
Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), Potential 3-stars: {<8, (0, 3, 5)>}
Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7), Potential 3-stars: {<9, (2, 3, 6)>}

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
