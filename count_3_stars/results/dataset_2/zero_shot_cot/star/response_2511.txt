Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph consisting of the following nodes:
<5, (1, 10, 14)>
<9, (8, 2, 14)>
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<7, (4, 6, 14)>
<1, (5, 11, 0)>
<3, (6, 2, 0)>
<10, (5, 0, 14)>
<11, (1, 8, 12)>
<8, (9, 11, 13)>
<13, (7, 11, 8)>
<2, (9, 3, 10)>
<12, (9, 11, 0)>
<0, (1, 10, 6)>
<14, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (7, 3, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
