Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (12, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 13) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 10) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 18) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the nodes that are connected in the form of a 3-star. Let's find all the 3-stars and count them.

We will consider each node as the potential center of a 3-star and check if it has exactly three edges connected to it.

1. Node 11:
   - (11, 16), (11, 3), (11, 7), (11, 5), (11, 17)
   - It forms a 3-star: <11, (16, 3, 7)>
   
2. Node 16:
   - (16, 11), (16, 7), (16, 12), (16, 14)
   - It does not form a 3-star.

3. Node 4:
   - (4, 8), (4, 18), (4, 1), (4, 15)
   - It forms a 3-star: <4, (8, 18, 1)>
   
4. Node 8:
   - (8, 4), (8, 17), (8, 7)
   - It forms a 3-star: <8, (4, 17, 7)>

5. Node 2:
   - (2, 18), (2, 9)
   - It does not form a 3-star.

6. Node 18:
   - (18, 4), (18, 2), (18, 17)
   - It forms a 3-star: <18, (4, 2, 17)>
   
7. Node 0:
   - (0, 5)
   - It does not form a 3-star.

8. Node 14:
   - (14, 16), (14, 9)
   - It does not form a 3-star.

9. Node 3:
   - (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 19)
   - It forms a 3-star: <3, (11, 7, 19)>
   
10. Node 12:
    - (12, 16)
    - It does not form a 3-star.

11. Node 1:
    - (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 19)
    - It forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 6, 10)>

12. Node 6:
    - (6, 1), (6, 19), (6, 13)
    - It forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 19, 13)>

13. Node 7:
    - (7, 11), (7, 16), (7, 8), (7, 3)
    - It forms a 3-star: <7, (11, 8, 3)>
    
14. Node 19:
    - (19, 3), (19, 1), (19, 6)
    - It forms a 3-star: <19, (3, 1, 6)>

15. Node 5:
    - (5, 11), (5, 0), (5, 15), (5, 10)
    - It forms a 3-star: <5, (11, 15, 10)>
    
16. Node 15:
    - (15, 4), (15, 5), (15, 13)
    - It does not form a 3-star.
    
17. Node 9:
    - (9, 2), (9, 14), (9, 13)
    - It does not form a 3-star.

18. Node 10:
    - (10, 1), (10, 5)
    - It does not form a 3-star.
      
19. Node 17:
    - (17, 11), (17, 8), (17, 18)
    - It forms a 3-star: <17, (11, 8, 18)>
    
20. Node 13:
    - (13, 6), (13, 15), (13, 9)
    - It does not form a 3-star.
