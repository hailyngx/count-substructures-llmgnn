Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 23) (27, 2) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 3) (23, 0) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 12) (14, 11) (14, 5) (4, 24) (4, 29) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 18) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 25) (28, 26) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 22) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 16) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 22) (15, 5) (15, 12) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 4) (29, 25) (6, 19) (6, 21) (6, 16) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 22) (2, 27) (2, 22) (2, 25) (22, 28) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 2) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 24) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 25) (9, 28) (9, 25) (25, 26) (25, 29) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 9) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 15) (7, 5) (7, 17) (17, 28) (17, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0: (0, 20), (0, 10), (0, 23)
   <0, (20, 10, 23)>

2. Node 3: (3, 11), (3, 13), (3, 18)
   <3, (11, 13, 18)>

3. Node 5: (5, 14), (5, 26), (5, 19)
   <5, (14, 26, 19)>

4. Node 8: (8, 13), (8, 23), (8, 20)
   <8, (13, 23, 20)>

5. Node 16: (16, 10), (16, 19), (16, 6)
   <16, (10, 19, 6)>

6. Node 20: (20, 0), (20, 8), (20, 23)
   <20, (0, 8, 23)>

7. Node 22: (22, 28), (22, 1), (22, 21)
   <22, (28, 1, 21)>

8. Node 25: (25, 26), (25, 29), (25, 2)
   <25, (26, 29, 2)>

9. Node 28: (28, 26), (28, 17), (28, 9)
   <28, (26, 17, 9)>

10. Node 29: (29, 8), (29, 20), (29, 4)
    <29, (8, 20, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
