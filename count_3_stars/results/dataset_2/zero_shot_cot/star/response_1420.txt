Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 
From the given edges, we can identify the following nodes with three edges connected to them: 3, 5, and 13.

Next, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (9, 4, 13)>
<5, (4, 7, 12)>
<13, (0, 5, 7)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Since we found 3 unique 3-stars, the total count is [3].
