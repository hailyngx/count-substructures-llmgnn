Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 12) (14, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges, which correspond to the leaves of a 3-star.

From the given edges, we can identify the following nodes that have exactly three edges:
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 7, 9, and 6.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 4, 0, and 11.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 4, 9, and 8.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 4, 6, and 1.
- Node 10 has edges with nodes 7, 11, and 5.
- Node 11 has edges with nodes 7, 10, and 5.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 6, 13, and 5.
- Node 13 has edges with nodes 6, 10, and 8.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 10, 11, and 8.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 9, 8, and 5.
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 4, 10, and 8.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 10, 11, and 1.

Based on the identified nodes, we can now count the number of 3-stars: 

There are 12 unique 3-stars in the graph, which can be represented as follows:
<4, (7, 9, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 11)>, <6, (4, 9, 8)>, <9, (4, 6, 1)>, <10, (7, 11, 5)>, <11, (7, 10, 5)>, <8, (6, 13, 5)>, <13, (6, 10, 8)>, <5, (10, 11, 8)>, <1, (9, 8, 5)>, <3, (4, 10, 8)>, <2, (10, 11, 1)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
