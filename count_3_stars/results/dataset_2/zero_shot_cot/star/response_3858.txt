Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 9) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 17) (5, 19) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 13) (1, 18) (1, 7) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 15) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 16) (15, 6) (15, 13) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 15) (16, 18) (16, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 17) (12, 18) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

1. Node 10: (10, 11), (10, 13), (10, 19) - <10, (11, 13, 19)>
2. Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 0), (11, 6), (11, 4) - <11, (10, 3, 0)>, <11, (10, 6, 4)>
3. Node 2: (2, 18), (2, 8), (2, 9) - <2, (18, 8, 9)>
4. Node 18: (18, 2), (18, 16), (18, 12), (18, 1) - <18, (2, 16, 12)>, <18, (2, 16, 1)>
5. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 6) - <8, (2, 0, 6)>
6. Node 0: (0, 11), (0, 8), (0, 14), (0, 7) - <0, (11, 8, 14)>
7. Node 14: (14, 0), (14, 19) - <14, (0, 19)>
8. Node 3: (3, 11), (3, 4) - <3, (11, 4)>
9. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 17) - <7, (0, 6, 1)>
10. Node 5: (5, 19), (5, 17) - <5, (19, 17)>
11. Node 19: (19, 10), (19, 14), (19, 5), (19, 13) - <19, (10, 14, 5)>, <19, (10, 14, 13)>
12. Node 1: (1, 18), (1, 7), (1, 9) - <1, (18, 7, 9)>
13. Node 6: (6, 11), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 15) - <6, (11, 8, 7)>
14. Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 16) - <9, (2, 1, 16)>
15. Node 15: (15, 6), (15, 13) - <15, (6, 13)>
16. Node 13: (13, 10), (13, 19), (13, 15) - <13, (10, 19, 15)>
17. Node 16: (16, 18), (16, 9) - <16, (18, 9)>
18. Node 4: (4, 11), (4, 3), (4, 17) - <4, (11, 3, 17)>
19. Node 12: (12, 18)
20. Node 17: (17, 7), (17, 5), (17, 4) - <17, (7, 5, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
