Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the nodes that serve as the center of a 3-star. For each potential center node, we will then check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

The potential center nodes are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 10, 11, 8, 13, 12, and 9.

Checking each potential center node:
- Node 4 is connected to 4, 7, 6, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to 4, 12, 11, 6, 2, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to 3, 2, 0, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to 4, 1, 6, 9, and 5.
- Node 10 is connected to 11, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 11 is connected to 7, 10, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to 1, 10, 11, 13, and 5.
- Node 13 is connected to 4, 8, 5, 2, and 9.
- Node 12 is connected to 7 and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to 3, 10, 13, and 0.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (3, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 13, 4)>
<13, (9, 8, 2)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

The final answer is: [4]
