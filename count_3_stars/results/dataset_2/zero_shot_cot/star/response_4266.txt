Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 2) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can check each node to see if it satisfies this condition.

The nodes and their connections are as follows:
- 0: Connected to 8, 3, 11, 12, 5
- 1: Connected to 12, 6, 10, 13
- 2: Connected to 8, 6, 3, 7, 4
- 3: Connected to 2, 11, 7, 0, 4
- 4: Connected to 2, 3
- 5: Connected to 0, 10, 14
- 6: Connected to 2, 1, 11, 14, 7
- 7: Connected to 2, 8, 3, 6, 14, 13
- 8: Connected to 2, 9, 11, 0, 7
- 9: Connected to 8, 10, 13
- 10: Connected to 9, 1, 5
- 11: Connected to 8, 3, 0, 6
- 12: Connected to 13, 0, 1
- 13: Connected to 9, 12, 1, 7
- 14: Connected to 6, 7, 5

Based on the connections, the central nodes for the 3-stars can be 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 13. Let's count how many 3-stars we can form with each of these central nodes:

- <2, (8, 4, 3)>
- <3, (11, 7, 2)>
- <6, (1, 14, 7)>
- <7, (8, 13, 6)>
- <8, (11, 7, 2)>
- <12, (13, 0, 1)>
- <13, (9, 7, 12)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 7, which can be shown as [7].
