Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges, here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<6, (9, 7, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<3, (1, 0, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
