Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 3) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 3, 6)>
<1, (8, 2, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<5, (3, 8, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 0, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 8, 7)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
