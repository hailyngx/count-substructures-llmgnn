Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 17) (4, 9) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 16) (14, 13) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (15, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 18) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 3) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 17) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 12) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 3) (16, 14) (16, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

Let's list the 3-stars we find:
<0, (14, 10, 13)>
<1, (13, 19, 18)>
<2, (6, 0, 3)>
<3, (8, 13, 18)>
<4, (9, 14, 16)>
<5, (6, 11, 12)>
<6, (5, 2, 15)>
<8, (3, 10, 8)>
<9, (4, 17, 9)>
<10, (0, 16, 12)>
<11, (18, 6, 5)>
<12, (17, 10, 5)>
<13, (14, 1, 0)>
<14, (4, 0, 16)>
<15, (2, 5, 6)>
<16, (10, 14, 0)>
<17, (12, 9, 17)>
<18, (1, 11, 3)>
<19, (2, 1, 17)>

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we just need to count the unique 3-stars we found. 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
