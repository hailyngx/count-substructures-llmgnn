Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking at nodes with exactly 3 incident edges.

The nodes with 3 incident edges are: 0, 2, 6, and 8.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
