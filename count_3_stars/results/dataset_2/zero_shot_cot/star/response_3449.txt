Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 17) (5, 13) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 16) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 6) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 12) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 11) (3, 18) (3, 13) (3, 17) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Upon analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<4, (2, 8, 19)>
<18, (9, 3, 17)>
<8, (2, 19, 17)>
<5, (13, 16, 14)>
<13, (5, 3, 1)>
<1, (13, 15, 9)>
<15, (13, 1, 10)>
<10, (15, 12, 14)>
<19, (4, 8, 11)>
<12, (10, 19, 16)>
<11, (19, 14, 7)>
<14, (5, 10, 11)>
<16, (5, 1, 19)>
<9, (18, 1, 15)>
<3, (18, 13, 17)>
<7, (11, 14, 6)>
<6, (14, 17, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found gives us a total of [16].
