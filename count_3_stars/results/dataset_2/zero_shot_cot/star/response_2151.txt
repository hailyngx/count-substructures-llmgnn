Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 7) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Central node: 1, Leaves: 3, 5, 9 (Count: 1 star)
- Central node: 3, Leaves: 1, 5, 8 (Count: 1 star)
- Central node: 4, Leaves: 2, 9, 10 (Count: 1 star)
- Central node: 8, Leaves: 0, 9, 13 (Count: 1 star)
- Central node: 10, Leaves: 0, 4, 13 (Count: 1 star)
- Central node: 11, Leaves: 0, 7, 13 (Count: 1 star)
- Central node: 12, Leaves: 1, 2, 6 (Count: 1 star)
- Central node: 14, Leaves: 2, 4, 5 (Count: 1 star)

Count of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 
Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 9, 10)>
<8, (0, 9, 13)>
<10, (0, 4, 13)>
<11, (0, 7, 13)>
<12, (1, 2, 6)>
<14, (2, 4, 5)>
