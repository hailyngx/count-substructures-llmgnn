Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its neighboring nodes. 

The neighboring nodes of each node are as follows:
Node 0: 9, 7, 11
Node 1: 5, 6, 14, 13
Node 2: 9, 4, 12
Node 3: 7, 13, 12
Node 4: 9, 7, 2
Node 5: 1, 11, 7
Node 6: 1, 10, 12, 13
Node 7: 5, 4, 0, 3, 14, 13
Node 8: 9, 11, 12
Node 9: 8, 4, 2, 0
Node 10: 6, 14, 13
Node 11: 5, 8, 0, 12, 14
Node 12: 3, 2, 8, 6, 14, 11
Node 13: 7, 1, 3, 6, 10
Node 14: 7, 1, 12, 11, 10

Now, let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (9, 7, 11)>
<1, (5, 6, 14)>
<2, (9, 4, 12)>
<3, (7, 13, 12)>
<4, (9, 7, 2)>
<5, (1, 11, 7)>
<6, (1, 10, 12)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<8, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (8, 4, 0)>
<10, (6, 14, 13)>
<11, (5, 8, 0)>
<12, (3, 2, 8)>
<13, (7, 1, 3)>
<14, (12, 11, 10)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
