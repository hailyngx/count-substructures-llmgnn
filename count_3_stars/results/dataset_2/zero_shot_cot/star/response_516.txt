Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node in each 3-star. It must have degree 3 in order to form a 3-star.

The nodes with degree 3 are: 5, 9, 1, 3, 4, 8, 0, 7, and 6.

Next, we will list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<5, (9, 1, 6)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 1, 0)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 0)>
<8, (1, 3, 0)>
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 3, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
