Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 22) (15, 4) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 9) (4, 15) (4, 24) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 12) (9, 29) (9, 19) (22, 15) (22, 10) (26, 24) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 17) (28, 3) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (24, 3) (24, 4) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 1) (7, 28) (7, 14) (7, 27) (25, 17) (25, 13) (20, 1) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 8) (17, 21) (23, 18) (23, 26) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 26) (11, 24) (11, 6) (11, 8) (1, 24) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 12) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (21, 17) (21, 0) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 12) (27, 7) (27, 6) (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 16) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 6) (16, 19) (16, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which form 3-stars. 

1. Node 3: (15, 24, 5)
2. Node 15: (3, 2, 22)
3. Node 2: (15, 29, 28)
4. Node 4: (15, 24, 4)
5. Node 18: (23, 14, 10)
6. Node 9: (29, 19, 9)
7. Node 22: (15, 10, 22)
8. Node 26: (24, 23, 10)
9. Node 28: (3, 2, 0)
10. Node 24: (3, 4, 26)
11. Node 7: (28, 14, 27)
12. Node 17: (25, 8, 21)
13. Node 8: (17, 11, 0)
14. Node 14: (18, 7, 8)
15. Node 21: (17, 0, 21)
16. Node 19: (9, 16, 12)
17. Node 27: (7, 6, 27)
18. Node 13: (25, 12, 16)
19. Node 12: (18, 1, 19)
20. Node 16: (19, 13, 5)
21. Node 6: (11, 27, 12)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. 

[<3, (15, 24, 5)>, <15, (3, 2, 22)>, <2, (15, 29, 28)>, <4, (15, 24, 4)>, <18, (23, 14, 10)>, <9, (29, 19, 9)>, <22, (15, 10, 22)>, <26, (24, 23, 10)>, <28, (3, 2, 0)>, <24, (3, 4, 26)>, <7, (28, 14, 27)>, <17, (25, 8, 21)>, <8, (17, 11, 0)>, <14, (18, 7, 8)>, <21, ...21)>, <19, (9, 16, 12)>, <27, (7, 6, 27)>, <13, (25, 12, 16)>, <12, (18, 1, 19)>, <16, (19, 13, 5)>, <6, (11, 27, 12)>]
