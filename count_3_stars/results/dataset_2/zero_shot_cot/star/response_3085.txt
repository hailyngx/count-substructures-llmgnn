Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 23) (9, 12) (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 10) (22, 29) (22, 3) (7, 25) (21, 0) (21, 11) (10, 22) (10, 24) (10, 20) (10, 29) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 12) (20, 10) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 14) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (28, 0) (28, 29) (29, 22) (29, 10) (29, 0) (29, 28) (29, 26) (4, 19) (8, 11) (8, 1) (1, 17) (1, 8) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 26) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 13) (25, 7) (25, 11) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 14) (27, 20) (27, 3) (11, 21) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 25) (14, 20) (14, 13) (15, 5) (15, 26) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 15) (26, 2) (26, 16) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 6) (16, 17) (16, 26) (16, 3) (2, 26) (2, 24) (3, 22) (3, 27) (3, 16) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (21, 28, 29)>
<1, (8, 13, 17)>
<2, (24, 26, 11)>
<3, (16, 22, 27)>
<4, (19, 13, 17)>
<5, (9, 15, 24)>
<6, (18, 23, 26)>
<7, (11, 25, 0)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
