Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 27) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 20) (1, 11) (21, 7) (21, 10) (7, 21) (7, 29) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 15) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 23) (6, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 2) (0, 6) (0, 23) (14, 9) (14, 10) (19, 26) (19, 10) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 24) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 26) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 9) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 17) (2, 25) (2, 28) (2, 5) (2, 20) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 20) (29, 11) (29, 16) (29, 7) (29, 27) (9, 14) (9, 10) (15, 22) (15, 23) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 0) (23, 15) (27, 11) (27, 29) (4, 5) (4, 20) (20, 16) (20, 2) (20, 5) (20, 4) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to find all the 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors (leaves).
- Node 11 has neighbors: 16, 1, 27, 29
- Node 16 has neighbors: 11, 12, 29, 20
- Node 1 has neighbor: 11
- Node 27 has neighbors: 11, 29
- Node 29 has neighbors: 11, 16, 7, 27
- Node 12 has neighbors: 16, 3, 8, 17
- Node 7 has neighbors: 21, 29
- Node 24 has neighbors: 13, 19, 26
- Node 17 has neighbors: 18, 13, 12, 5
- Node 10 has neighbors: 21, 6, 14, 19, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors: 8, 17, 2, 4, 20
- Node 6 has neighbors: 18, 28, 10, 0
- Node 25 has neighbors: 3, 23, 2
- Node 13 has neighbors: 8, 17, 24, 23
- Node 19 has neighbors: 26, 10, 24
- Node 2 has neighbors: 25, 28, 5, 20
- Node 20 has neighbors: 16, 2, 5, 4
- Node 26 has neighbors: 19, 24
- Node 21 has neighbors: 7, 10
- Node 3 has neighbors: 25, 12
- Node 8 has neighbors: 13, 5, 12
- Node 18 has neighbors: 22, 6, 17

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars based on the nodes found in step 1.
By checking the neighbors of each node from step 1, we can list all unique 3-star configurations:
<11, (16, 1, 27)>
<16, (11, 12, 20)>
<1, (11, 27, 0)>
<27, (11, 29, 0)>
<29, (11, 16, 7)>
<12, (16, 3, 17)>
<7, (21, 29, 0)>
<24, (13, 19, 26)>
<17, (18, 13, 12)>
<10, (21, 6, 19)>
<5, (8, 17, 2)>
<6, (18, 28, 10)>
<25, (3, 23, 2)>
<13, (8, 17, 24)>
<19, (26, 10, 24)>
<2, (25, 28, 5)>
<20, (16, 2, 4)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
