Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the edges provided. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 10, 11)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<13, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (9, 11, 14)>
<12, (4, 9, 12)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 10, 14)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<11, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 12, 13)>
<0, (2, 10, 13)>
<10, (0, 3, 5)>
<14, (3, 5, 7)>
<9, (7, 10, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
