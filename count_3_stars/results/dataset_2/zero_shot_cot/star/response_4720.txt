Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 16) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 10) (26, 15) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 4) (15, 26) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 11) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 1) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 22) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 29) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 19) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 8) (11, 29) (28, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 29) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 10) (17, 18) (17, 13) (23, 16) (23, 29) (23, 21) (1, 27) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 20) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 20) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 16) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 13) (19, 14) (19, 18) (19, 25) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 21) (8, 11) (8, 5) (20, 13) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 24) (4, 3) (24, 20) (24, 22) (24, 21) (16, 9) (16, 23) (16, 5) (22, 7) (22, 24) (21, 23) (21, 25) (21, 24) (29, 12) (29, 11) (29, 18) (29, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes as per the definition provided.

Let's first identify the central nodes of the 3-stars by looking at nodes with three incident edges:
- Node 26 has edges (26, 18), (26, 5), (26, 10), (26, 15)
- Node 15 has edges (15, 26), (15, 3), (15, 13), (15, 11)
- Node 11 has edges (11, 15), (11, 28), (11, 8), (11, 29)
- Node 18 has edges (18, 26), (18, 19), (18, 17), (18, 29)
- Node 13 has edges (13, 15), (13, 17), (13, 20), (13, 10)
- Node 20 has edges (20, 13), (20, 6), (20, 2), (20, 24)

Next, let's find the leaves for each central node:
- For central node 26: (18, 5, 10), <26, (18, 5, 10)>
- For central node 15: (3, 13, 11), <15, (3, 13, 11)>
- For central node 11: (28, 8, 29), <11, (28, 8, 29)>
- For central node 18: (19, 17, 29), <18, (19, 17, 29)>
- For central node 13: (17, 20, 10), <13, (17, 20, 10)>
- For central node 20: (6, 2, 24), <20, (6, 2, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
