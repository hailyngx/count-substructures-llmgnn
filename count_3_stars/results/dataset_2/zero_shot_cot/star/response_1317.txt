Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 10) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 12)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (9, 10, 12)>
<3, (4, 6, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 14)>
<5, (4, 9, 14)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 8, 11)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<10, (3, 8, 10)>
<11, (1, 8, 11)>
<12, (0, 2, 10)>
<13, (2, 11, 13)>
<14, (4, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
