Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 15) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 18) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 10) (12, 6) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (15, 4) (15, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can count the number of 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 6: (6, 2, 18), (6, 12, 14) <6, (2, 18, 12)>
2. Node 9: (9, 2, 4) <9, (2, 4, 16)>
3. Node 8: (8, 4, 13) <8, (4, 13, 5)>
4. Node 13: (13, 4, 8) <13, (4, 8, 11)>
5. Node 4: (4, 9, 13), (4, 8, 15), (4, 2, 15), (4, 5, 14) <4, (9, 13, 8), (8, 15, 4), (2, 15, 4), (5, 14, 4)>
6. Node 2: (2, 6, 15), (2, 9, 15) <2, (6, 15, 2), (9, 15, 2)>
7. Node 1: (1, 7, 19) <1, (7, 19, 1)>
8. Node 17: (17, 1, 19) <17, (1, 19, 18)>
9. Node 3: (3, 5, 18) <3, (5, 18, 3)>
10. Node 11: (11, 7, 0), (11, 5, 13) <11, (7, 0, 11), (5, 13, 11)>
11. Node 0: (0, 11, 16), (0, 19, 16) <0, (11, 16, 0), (19, 16, 0)>
12. Node 16: (16, 0, 9), (16, 10, 18) <16, (0, 9, 16), (10, 18, 16)>
13. Node 12: (12, 6, 14) <12, (6, 14, 12)>
14. Node 7: (7, 1, 11) <7, (1, 11, 7)>
15. Node 15: (15, 2, 4) <15, (2, 4, 15)>
16. Node 19: (19, 0, 1) <19, (0, 1, 19)>
17. Node 5: (5, 3, 11), (5, 8, 14) <5, (3, 11, 5), (8, 14, 5)>
18. Node 14: (14, 5, 6), (14, 12, 6) <14, (5, 6, 14), (12, 6, 14)>
19. Node 10: (10, 16, 18) <10, (16, 18, 10)>
20. Node 18: (18, 6, 17), (18, 3, 10) <18, (6, 17, 18), (3, 10, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
