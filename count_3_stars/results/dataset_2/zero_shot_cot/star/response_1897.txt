Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 18) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (15, 17) (15, 0) (8, 14) (8, 17) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 18) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in each 3-star structure. 

For each node, we will count how many edges it shares with other nodes. If a node shares exactly 3 edges, then it is part of a 3-star structure. 

Here are the nodes along with the number of edges they share:

Node 0: 3 edges
Node 1: 2 edges
Node 2: 2 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 3 edges
Node 6: 3 edges
Node 7: 2 edges
Node 8: 2 edges
Node 9: 4 edges
Node 10: 3 edges
Node 11: 2 edges
Node 12: 3 edges
Node 13: 3 edges
Node 14: 3 edges
Node 15: 2 edges
Node 16: 4 edges
Node 17: 4 edges
Node 18: 5 edges
Node 19: 3 edges

Only nodes 4, 9, 16, and 18 have exactly 3 edges each, so they are the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

The unique 3-star structures are:
<4, (1, 3, 18)>
<9, (0, 13, 2)>
<16, (3, 7, 10)>
<18, (1, 4, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
