Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 4) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Starting from node 2:
   - (2, 8), (2, 14), (2, 7)

2. Moving on to node 8:
   - (8, 2)

3. Moving on to node 1:
   - (1, 11), (1, 4), (1, 12)

4. Moving on to node 11:
   - (11, 3)

5. Moving on to node 3:
   - (3, 14), (3, 5), (3, 13)

6. Moving on to node 5:
   - (5, 13), (5, 4), (5, 3)

7. Moving on to node 13:
   - (13, 5)

8. Moving on to node 12:
   - (12, 13), (12, 3), (12, 1)

By listing the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (8, 14, 7)>
<1, (11, 4, 12)>
<11, (3, 1, 9)>
<3, (14, 5, 13)>
<5, (13, 4, 3)>
<13, (5, 12, 3)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
