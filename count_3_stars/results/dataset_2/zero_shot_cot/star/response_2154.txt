Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. We will then identify the 3-stars around these nodes.

1. Node 1 has 5 edges connected to it: (1, 7), (1, 5), (1, 12), (1, 11), (1, 0).
2. Node 2 has 4 edges connected to it: (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 14), (2, 11).
3. Node 3 has 4 edges connected to it: (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 11), (3, 9).
4. Node 4 has 3 edges connected to it: (4, 10), (4, 5), (4, 6).
5. Node 6 has 5 edges connected to it: (6, 4), (6, 13), (6, 14), (6, 12), (6, 0).
6. Node 9 has 6 edges connected to it: (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 11), (9, 10).
7. Node 11 has 6 edges connected to it: (11, 2), (11, 12), (11, 3), (11, 1), (11, 0), (11, 9).
8. Node 12 has 5 edges connected to it: (12, 8), (12, 6), (12, 14), (12, 11), (12, 1).

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
<1, (7, 5, 12)>
<1, (7, 5, 11)>
<1, (7, 0, 5)>
<2, (5, 9, 14)>
<2, (5, 9, 11)>
<3, (7, 8, 11)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (10, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 13, 14)>
<6, (4, 13, 12)>
<6, (4, 12, 0)>
<6, (13, 7, 14)>
<6, (13, 7, 8)>
<6, (13, 7, 9)>
<6, (13, 8, 0)>
<6, (0, 11, 1)>
<9, (7, 8, 11)>
<9, (7, 8, 3)>
<9, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (8, 12, 6)>
<9, (8, 12, 11)>
<9, (8, 12, 1)>
<9, (8, 12, 14)>
<9, (12, 1, 0)>
<11, (2, 12, 14)>
<11, (2, 12, 1)>
<11, (2, 12, 11)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
