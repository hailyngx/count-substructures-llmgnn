Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 12) (11, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star. 
To form a 3-star, one node must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all such cases.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 14.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <8, (7, 9, 5)>
- <9, (7, 3, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
