Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes with degree three as potential centers of 3-stars since they are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes with degree three: 5, 6, 3, 1, and 0

Then, we look at each potential center and list out the connected nodes to form possible 3-stars. We should make sure the edges are valid (i.e., connected nodes form a 3-star pattern).

For node 5:
- Neighborhood: 9, 6, 2, 3
- 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 2)> [1 unique 3-star found for node 5]

For node 6:
- Neighborhood: 5, 9, 3, 2, 8, 0
- 3-stars: <6, (5, 9, 3)> [1 unique 3-star found for node 6]

For node 3:
- Neighborhood: 5, 9, 6, 4, 1, 0
- 3-stars: <3, (5, 9, 6)> [1 unique 3-star found for node 3]

For node 1:
- Neighborhood: 2, 4, 7, 3, 8
- No 3-stars found for node 1

For node 0:
- Neighborhood: 9, 6, 4, 3, 8
- No 3-stars found for node 0

Summing up the unique 3-stars found for each potential center gives us a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
