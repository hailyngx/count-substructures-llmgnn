Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 5) (5, 10) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three nodes (leaves) in the graph.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 4: (7, 1, 14)
2. Node 7: (0, 9, 4)
3. Node 6: (10, 11, 12)
4. Node 9: (6, 3, 4)
5. Node 10: (6, 5, 11)
6. Node 11: (6, 10, 13)
7. Node 1: (4, 3, 5)
8. Node 3: (9, 1, 13)
9. Node 2: (8, 5, 12)
10. Node 8: (6, 1, 2)
11. Node 0: (7, 14, 4)
12. Node 14: (0, 12, 5)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
