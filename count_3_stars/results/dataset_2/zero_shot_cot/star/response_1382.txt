Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can list the 3-stars:
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 2)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
