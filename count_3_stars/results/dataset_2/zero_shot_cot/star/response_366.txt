Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 0)>
<3, (7, 1, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (4, 7, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 2)>
<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<9, (1, 0, 9)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final answer is [10].
