Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 11) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 18) (0, 11) (0, 6) (7, 15) (8, 1) (8, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star. 
A 3-star will have one central node and three leaves. 
To do this, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges (each edge corresponds to a leaf node).

Nodes with 3 incident edges:  
- Node 3 
- Node 15 
- Node 11 
- Node 1 
- Node 17 
- Node 6 
- Node 12 
- Node 18 
- Node 13

Next, let's construct the 3-stars and count them:

1. For Node 3:
<3, (2, 6, 19)>
<3, (15, 11, 6)>

2. For Node 15:
<15, (3, 11, 12)>
<15, (3, 7, 12)>

3. For Node 11:
<11, (3, 15, 12)>
<11, (3, 0, 12)>

4. For Node 1:
<1, (17, 8, -)>

5. For Node 17:
<17, (1, 6, -)>

6. For Node 6:
<6, (3, 17, 19)>
<6, (0, 17, 19)>

7. For Node 12:
<12, (15, 11, 8)>
<12, (15, 10, 8)>

8. For Node 18:
<18, (17, 9, -)>

9. For Node 13:
<13, (4, 2, 19)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [9].
