Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, let's find all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 9, 3, and 6.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 8, 3, and 2.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 7, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 7, 4, and 0.
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 6, 2, and 3.

2. There are three unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<4, (8, 3, 2)>
<8, (7, 4, 6)>

3. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
