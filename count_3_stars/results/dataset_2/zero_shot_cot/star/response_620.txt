Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 1) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 12) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (15, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 10) (0, 4) (11, 9) (11, 7) (3, 19) (3, 10) (3, 14) (14, 8) (14, 3) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, indicated by the following:

<5, (9, 2, 6)>
<9, (5, 6, 11)>
<6, (9, 18, 16)>
<8, (13, 15, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
