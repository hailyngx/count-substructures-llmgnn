Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: {9, 7, 4}
- Node 1: {7, 8}
- Node 2: {5, 9, 6, 7, 3, 4}
- Node 3: {6, 8, 2}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 0, 2}
- Node 5: {9, 2, 8, 4}
- Node 6: {3, 2, 4}
- Node 7: {9, 0, 2, 1, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 9, 7, 3, 1}
- Node 9: {5, 8, 2, 7, 0}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (9, 7, 4)>
<1, (7, 8, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 3)>
<4, (5, 6, 4)>
<5, (9, 8, 5)>
<6, (3, 2, 6)>
<7, (9, 0, 7)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (8, 7, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us [10].
