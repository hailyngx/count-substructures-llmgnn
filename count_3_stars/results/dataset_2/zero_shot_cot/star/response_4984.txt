Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 8) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 9) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 4) (5, 15) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 18) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 0) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in the 3-star graphs. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with three edges connected to them.

Nodes with three edges connected to them:
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 12

Now, we can pair these nodes with the central node to form the 3-stars:

<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (13, 15, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 13, 15)>
<12, (3, 14, 18)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have [5].
