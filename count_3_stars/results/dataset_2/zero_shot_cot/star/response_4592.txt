Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 19) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (10, 14) (10, 0) (10, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 4) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. We will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

Central nodes: 3, 15, 14, 6, 9, 5, 0, 7, 8, 19, 18, 10, 12, 16, 13, 4, 11

Next, let's identify the leaves connected to each central node:

- Central node 3: 15, 7, 12
- Central node 15: 3, 18, 6, 8
- Central node 14: 17, 5, 10
- Central node 6: 15, 9, 11
- Central node 9: 6, 7, 0
- Central node 5: 14, 0
- Central node 0: 9, 5, 10
- Central node 7: 3, 9, 2
- Central node 8: 15, 19
- Central node 19: 9, 8, 18, 13, 12
- Central node 18: 15, 19, 11
- Central node 10: 14, 0, 1
- Central node 12: 3, 19, 16
- Central node 16: 12, 2, 4
- Central node 13: 19, 1, 4
- Central node 4: 0, 16, 13, 11

Now, we list out the unique 3-stars:
<3, (15, 7, 12)>
<15, (3, 18, 6)>
<14, (17, 5, 10)>
<6, (15, 9, 11)>
<9, (6, 7, 0)>
<5, (14, 0)>
<0, (9, 5, 10)>
<7, (3, 9, 2)>
<8, (15, 19)>
<19, (9, 8, 18)>
<18, (15, 19, 11)>
<10, (14, 0, 1)>
<12, (3, 19, 16)>
<16, (12, 2, 4)>
<13, (19, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 16, 13)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 16 in total. Therefore, the answer is [16].
