Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph and count them:

1. 3-star with center node 2: (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 1) <2, (5, 9, 1)>
2. 3-star with center node 3: (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1) <3, (9, 4, 1)>

So, there are a total of [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
