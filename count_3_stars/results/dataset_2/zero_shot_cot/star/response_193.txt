Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:
1. Identify the nodes connected to each node to determine the potential center of the 3-star.
2. For each node, check if it has exactly three neighbors. If so, form a 3-star with that node as the center and its neighbors as leaves.
3. Count the unique 3-stars formed in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 6), (0, 4, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 6, 9), (2, 7, 8), (2, 0, 2)
- Node 3: (3, 1, 0), (3, 4, 9), (3, 9, 6)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 3), (4, 3, 1), (4, 6, 9)
- Node 5: No 3-star (only 4 neighbors)
- Node 6: (6, 0, 2), (6, 4, 9), (6, 2, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 4), (7, 2, 8), (7, 5, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 2, 7), (8, 5, 7), (8, 7, 2)
- Node 9: (9, 6, 2), (9, 3, 4), (9, 0, 3)

Unique 3-stars formed: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 0)>, <2, (6, 9, 2)>, <2, (7, 8, 2)>, <2, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 0, 3)>, <3, (4, 9, 3)>, <3, (6, 9, 3)>, <4, (0, 3, 4)>, <4, (3, 1, 4)>, <4, (6, 9, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 6)>, <6, (4, 9, 6)>, <6, (2, 7, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 8, 7)>, <7, (5, 8, 7)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (7, 2, 8)>, <9, (6, 2, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
