Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <5, (9, 8, 1)>
2. <9, (5, 12, 11)>
3. <6, (14, 7, 10)>
4. <1, (5, 13, 2)>
5. <3, (7, 0, 4)>
6. <7, (6, 12, 3)>
7. <12, (9, 8, 4)>
8. <0, (5, 3, 4)>
9. <8, (9, 10, 5)>
10. <4, (5, 12, 3)>
11. <2, (1, 13, 14)>
12. <11, (9, 1, 8)>
13. <14, (6, 13, 10)>
14. <10, (6, 14, 8)>
15. <13, (1, 2, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
