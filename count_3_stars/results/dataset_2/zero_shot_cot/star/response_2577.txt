Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the graph and identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (6, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (4, 2, 8)>
3. <2, (9, 7, 13)>
4. <3, (2, 12, 14)>
5. <4, (9, 1, 7)>
6. <5, (4, 11, 13)>
7. <6, (0, 8, 9)>
8. <7, (1, 4, 10)>
9. <8, (6, 0, 1)>
10. <9, (2, 4, 14)>
11. <10, (7, 5, 12)>
12. <11, (5, 7, 12)>
13. <12, (5, 10, 3)>
14. <13, (5, 2, 9)>
15. <14, (9, 3, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
