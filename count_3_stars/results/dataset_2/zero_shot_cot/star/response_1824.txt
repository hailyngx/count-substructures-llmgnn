Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with node 5:
- 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 7)>
- 3-star: <5, (2, 4, 9)>
- 3-star: <5, (7, 4, 9)>
- 3-star: <5, (7, 9, 2)>

Moving to node 9:
- 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 8)>
- 3-star: <9, (6, 8, 2)>
- 3-star: <9, (8, 4, 6)>
- 3-star: <9, (8, 6, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
