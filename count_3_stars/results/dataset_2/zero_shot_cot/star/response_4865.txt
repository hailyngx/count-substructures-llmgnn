Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes connected to each node:
   Node 0: Connected to nodes 7, 1
   Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 7, 8, 0
   Node 2: Connected to nodes 4, 8, 5, 3
   Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 2, 5
   Node 4: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 7, 2, 5, 3
   Node 5: Connected to nodes 4, 2, 8, 3
   Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 7, 4, 8
   Node 7: Connected to nodes 6, 4, 0, 1
   Node 8: Connected to nodes 9, 2, 5, 1, 6
   Node 9: Connected to nodes 8, 4, 1

2. List each 3-star in the graph:
   <0, (7, 1, 6)>
   <2, (4, 8, 5)>
   <3, (4, 2, 5)>
   <4, (6, 9, 7)>
   <5, (4, 2, 3)>
   <6, (1, 7, 4)>
   <7, (6, 4, 0)>
   <8, (9, 2, 5)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [8]

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
