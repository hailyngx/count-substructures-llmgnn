Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 11) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 3) (18, 22) (18, 19) (22, 18) (22, 20) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 24) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 12) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 24) (4, 11) (8, 28) (8, 16) (8, 6) (7, 14) (7, 23) (7, 26) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 1) (28, 8) (28, 5) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 24) (9, 27) (5, 14) (5, 28) (5, 25) (5, 20) (13, 16) (13, 27) (1, 11) (1, 10) (15, 12) (15, 9) (15, 23) (20, 29) (20, 22) (20, 5) (20, 6) (10, 1) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 19) (21, 10) (25, 2) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 23) (27, 9) (27, 13) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 10) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 25) (23, 26) (26, 7) (26, 10) (26, 23) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 3) (3, 29) (3, 0) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 9) (16, 8) (16, 13) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step to find and count the 3-stars.

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2: (2, 29), (2, 11), (2, 25) -> Possible 3-star: <2, (29, 11, 25)>
- Node 29: (29, 2), (29, 20), (29, 3) -> Possible 3-star: <29, (2, 20, 3)>
(No other nodes have exactly three connections)

2. List of 3-stars found:
- <2, (29, 11, 25)>
- <29, (2, 20, 3)>

3. Counting the number of 3-stars: [2]
