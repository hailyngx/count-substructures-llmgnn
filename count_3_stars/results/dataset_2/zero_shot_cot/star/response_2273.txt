Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 5) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 3) (27, 19) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (23, 12) (23, 19) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 21) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 28) (6, 2) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 11) (24, 26) (24, 18) (3, 27) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (11, 8) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 25) (21, 20) (21, 29) (21, 17) (17, 20) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 4) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 14) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 18) (28, 5) (28, 9) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 4) (29, 10) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 29) (4, 2) (4, 9) (19, 27) (19, 23) (19, 15) (19, 3) (18, 24) (18, 16) (18, 14) (9, 7) (9, 28) (9, 4) (9, 14) (12, 13) (12, 23) (12, 15) (22, 27) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 9) (25, 11) (25, 10) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

The possible 3-star patterns in this graph are as follows:
<0, (2, 5, 27)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (7, 11, 19)>
<4, (2, 9, 17)>
<9, (4, 9, 14)>
<10, (13, 25, 29)>
<11, (3, 11, 25)>
<12, (13, 15, 23)>
<13, (10, 12, 13)>
<14, (1, 9, 18)>
<15, (12, 15, 19)>
<17, (4, 17, 21)>
<18, (14, 16, 24)>
<19, (15, 19, 27)>
<20, (17, 20, 21)>
<21, (17, 20, 29)>
<27, (0, 19, 27)>
<29, (10, 21, 29)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
