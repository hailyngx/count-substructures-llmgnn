Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes are connected to the center of a 3-star. We will look for nodes that have degree 3.

Nodes with degree 3: 1, 2, 4, 8

Next, for each node with degree 3, we will check if it forms a 3-star.

<1, (2, 3, 14)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<8, (7, 14, 11)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: 
[4]
