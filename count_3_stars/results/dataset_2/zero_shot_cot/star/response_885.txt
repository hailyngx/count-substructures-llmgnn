Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 15) (2, 10) (29, 22) (7, 21) (7, 1) (7, 9) (7, 13) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 3) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 1) (20, 25) (20, 4) (20, 23) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 17) (12, 27) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 19) (27, 6) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 26) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 4) (24, 26) (24, 28) (26, 0) (26, 24) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 17) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 1) (3, 21) (3, 19) (3, 22) (3, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 9) (28, 22) (4, 11) (4, 20) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 7) (9, 28) (9, 4) (15, 16) (15, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (23, 10) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 5) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 6) (5, 18) (22, 29) (22, 3) (22, 28) (19, 27) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

There are multiple 3-stars in this graph, and we will list each unique 3-star below before providing the final count:

<0, (12, 14, 19)>
<1, (7, 13, 17)>
<2, (10, 20, 23)>
<3, (18, 19, 22)>
<4, (9, 14, 20)>
<6, (10, 12, 27)>
<7, (1, 9, 13)>
<8, (11, 15, 16)>
<22, (3, 22, 28)>
<26, (0, 24, 26)>
