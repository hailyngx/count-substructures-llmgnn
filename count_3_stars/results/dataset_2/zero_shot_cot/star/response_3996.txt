Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
