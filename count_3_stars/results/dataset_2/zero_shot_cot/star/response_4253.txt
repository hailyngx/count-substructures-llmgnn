Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars we can find:

<0, (3, 10, 12)>
<1, (5, 11, 13)>
<2, (9, 13, 10)>
<3, (1, 6, 14)>
<4, (7, 9, 13)>
<5, (1, 11, 5)>
<6, (3, 11, 14)>
<7, (4, 9, 10)>
<8, (6, 14, 8)>
<9, (4, 7, 2)>
<10, (0, 3, 2)>
<11, (1, 6, 5)>
<12, (0, 6, 8)>
<13, (1, 4, 2)>
<14, (3, 8, 6)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of 14 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [14].
