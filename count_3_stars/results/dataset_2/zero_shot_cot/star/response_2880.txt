Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 17) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 16) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 4) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 7) (15, 11) (15, 17) (2, 0) (2, 7) (10, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's do this step by step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 3: (3, 11), (3, 10), (3, 16), (3, 8), (3, 4)
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 19), (4, 13), (4, 12), (4, 16)
- Node 5: (5, 19), (5, 8), (5, 12), (5, 17)
- Node 7: (7, 14), (7, 16), (7, 18), (7, 2)
- Node 12: (12, 6), (12, 5), (12, 1), (12, 4)
- Node 13: (13, 6), (13, 1), (13, 4)
- Node 17: (17, 9), (17, 5), (17, 1), (17, 15)

2. Form all unique 3-star graphs from the identified nodes:
- <3, (11, 10, 16)>
- <4, (19, 13, 12), (3, 16, 1), (1, 13, 6), (6, 12, 5), (5, 19, 4)>
- <5, (19, 8, 17), (8, 12, 5)>
- <7, (14, 16, 18)>
- <12, (6, 5, 1), (5, 4, 12)>
- <13, (6, 1, 4)>
- <17, (9, 5, 1), (5, 1, 15), (1, 13, 17)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
- Total = 7

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [7].
