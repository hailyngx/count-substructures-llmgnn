Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's count the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 0, 8, and 7. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 1 is <1, (3, 5, 0)>.
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 1, 5, and 8. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 3 is <3, (6, 9, 1)>.
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 0, and 5. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 4 is <4, (7, 8, 0)>.
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 1, 3, 4, and 2. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 5 is <5, (6, 1, 3)>.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 0, and 8. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 7 is <7, (1, 4, 0)>.
6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 7, and 2. Therefore, the 3-star centered at node 8 is <8, (1, 3, 4)>.

So, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final count is [5].
