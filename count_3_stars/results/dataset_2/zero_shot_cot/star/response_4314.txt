Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 26) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 23) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 7) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 2) (10, 24) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 19) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 0) (5, 20) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 17) (14, 0) (14, 23) (26, 11) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 25) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 19) (20, 11) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 17) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 12) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 28) (2, 21) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 26) (1, 25) (1, 28) (1, 7) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 1) (21, 13) (21, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 1) (24, 10) (12, 9) (12, 29) (28, 15) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 19) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 28) 

Response:
Categorize the nodes based on the number of edges connected to each node:
- Node 0: 4 edges
- Node 1: 3 edges
- Node 2: 4 edges
- Node 3: 1 edge
- Node 5: 4 edges
- Node 6: 3 edges
- Node 7: 4 edges
- Node 8: 3 edges
- Node 9: 3 edges
- Node 10: 1 edge
- Node 11: 4 edges
- Node 12: 2 edges
- Node 13: 5 edges
- Node 14: 2 edges
- Node 15: 3 edges
- Node 16: 2 edges
- Node 17: 5 edges
- Node 18: 4 edges
- Node 19: 4 edges
- Node 20: 4 edges
- Node 21: 2 edges
- Node 22: 3 edges
- Node 23: 4 edges
- Node 24: 1 edge
- Node 25: 3 edges
- Node 26: 4 edges
- Node 27: 3 edges
- Node 28: 4 edges
- Node 29: 3 edges

From the categorization, we can see that the nodes with 4 edges are potential central nodes of 3-stars. Therefore, we will check the 3-stars involving these nodes:

<0, (5, 6, 17)>
<2, (13, 21, 28)>
<5, (0, 6, 23)>
<7, (18, 29, 1)>
<11, (16, 26, 20)>
<13, (8, 17, 19)>
<17, (13, 0, 19)>
<18, (22, 6, 25)>
<19, (13, 6, 28)>
<20, (15, 27, 17)>
<23, (3, 5, 14)>
<26, (11, 22, 25)>
<28, (15, 2, 19)>
<29, (9, 12, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph:
