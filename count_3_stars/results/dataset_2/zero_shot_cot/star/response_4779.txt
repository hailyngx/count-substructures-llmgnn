Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 9) (17, 15) (2, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 9) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 19) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 15) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 19) (19, 16) (19, 15) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 18) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 5) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (1, 10, 5)>
<1, (0, 10, 4)>
<2, (6, 0, 5)>
<3, (8, 13, 12)>
<4, (10, 11, 5)>
<5, (0, 6, 14)>
<6, (2, 0, 14)>
<7, (11, 15, 9)>
<8, (3, 13, 12)>
<9, (13, 17, 7)>
<10, (1, 11, 4)>
<11, (10, 14, 7)>
<12, (8, 16, 5)>
<13, (8, 15, 9)>
<14, (11, 6, 5)>
<15, (13, 17, 7)>
<16, (12, 18, 19)>
<17, (13, 15, 9)>
<18, (8, 16, 5)>
<19, (16, 15, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
