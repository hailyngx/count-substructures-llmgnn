Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (15, 10) (15, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 1) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 7) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 1) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 17) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 15) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. 

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 6
- Node 16
- Node 10
- Node 12
- Node 18
- Node 13
- Node 17
- Node 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by checking each central node and its connected nodes.

- For node 5: (5, 9, 6), (5, 9, 18)
- For node 9: (9, 5, 8), (9, 6, 7), (9, 8, 2)
- For node 6: (6, 5, 10)
- For node 16: (16, 3, 18), (16, 14, 15)
- For node 10: (10, 6, 15), (10, 12, 2)
- For node 12: (12, 10, 4), (12, 4, 11)
- For node 18: (18, 5, 16)
- For node 13: (13, 18, 17), (13, 1, 7)
- For node 17: (17, 13, 7)
- For node 7: (7, 9, 17)

Counting these unique 3-stars gives 12 in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
The 3-stars found are: 
<5, (9, 6, 18)>
<9, (5, 8, 6)>
<16, (3, 14, 15)>
<10, (6, 12, 15)>
<12, (4, 10, 11)>
<13, (18, 17, 7)>
<7, (9, 17, 13)>
