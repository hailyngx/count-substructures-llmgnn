Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's go through the list of edges to find the 3-stars:

1. <5, (9, 1, 7)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 2)>
3. <6, (9, 1, 3)>
4. <4, (6, 1, 3)>
5. <8, (2, 0, 1)>
6. <2, (9, 4, 8)>
7. <0, (9, 8, 7)>
8. <7, (5, 9, 0)>
9. <1, (5, 9, 6)>
10. <3, (6, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
