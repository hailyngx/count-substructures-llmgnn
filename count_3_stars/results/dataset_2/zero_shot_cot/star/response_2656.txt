Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 27) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 19) (21, 20) (21, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 24) (29, 26) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 25) (13, 27) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 20) (5, 27) (24, 26) (24, 17) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 15) (25, 29) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 10) (25, 11) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 19) (20, 21) (20, 29) (20, 5) (20, 7) (9, 29) (9, 15) (2, 22) (2, 4) (22, 0) (22, 14) (22, 2) (3, 17) (3, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (11, 0) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 7) (15, 9) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 27) (10, 25) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (18, 21) (18, 5) (8, 26) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 10) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 10) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's list them below:

<1, (7, 23, 27)>
<26, (24, 29, 8)>
<0, (14, 11, 22)>
<14, (22, 6, 19)>
<21, (20, 18, not connected)>
<17, (3, 16, 24)>
<29, (20, 9, 25)>
<13, (27, not connected, not connected)>
<5, (18, 12, 20)>
<7, (25, 20, 15)>
<16, (23, 4, 19)>
<20, (21, 29, 7)>
<9, (15, not connected, not connected)>
<2, (22, 4, not connected)>
<3, (17, 10, not connected)>
<12, (17, 5, not connected)>
<6, (14, 11, not connected)>
<11, (0, 25, 6)>
<19, (14, 16, not connected)>
<15, (7, 9, not connected)>
<23, (1, 16, 27)>
<10, (25, 3, 8)>
<18, (21, 5, not connected)>
<8, (26, 0, 11)>
<4, (25, 16, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique ones from the list above.
