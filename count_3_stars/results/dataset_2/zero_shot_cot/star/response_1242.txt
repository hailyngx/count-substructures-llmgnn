Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 9) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 6) (2, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for 3-stars by checking if there are nodes with exactly 3 edges that are connected to a common node. 

After examining all possible combinations, we find the following 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (8, 4, 9)>
<1, (7, 11, 10)>
<2, (7, 1, 10)>
<3, (5, 6, 14)>
<4, (8, 9, 11)>
<5, (13, 12, 14)>
<6, (4, 8, 11)>
<7, (2, 1, 10)>
<8, (4, 0, 6)>
<9, (4, 12, 10)>
<10, (7, 12, 1)>
<11, (4, 5, 6)>
<12, (7, 5, 9)>
<13, (5, 6, 14)>
<14, (12, 5, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
