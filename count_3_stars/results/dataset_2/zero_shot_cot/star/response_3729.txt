Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9  
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7  
Node 2: 4, 5, 6, 8  
Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 4: 1, 2, 8, 9  
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9  
Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 5, 8  
Node 7: 1  
Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 6  
Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Next, let's count the number of 3-star graphs:
There are 3-star graphs centered at nodes 5, 4, and 3.  
For node 5: (5, 2, 6), (5, 3, 9), (5, 1, 0)  
For node 4: (4, 2, 8)  
For node 3: (3, 8, 9)

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this graph is [4] <5, (2, 6, 5)>, <5, (3, 9, 5)>, <5, (1, 0, 5)>, <4, (2, 8, 4)>.
