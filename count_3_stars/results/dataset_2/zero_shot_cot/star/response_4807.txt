Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 22) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 29) (20, 2) (25, 29) (25, 28) (28, 6) (28, 25) (28, 29) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 14) (18, 23) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 15) (26, 0) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 11) (15, 26) (15, 12) (7, 1) (7, 24) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 22) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 27) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 5) (21, 16) (21, 22) (21, 2) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 21) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 11) (23, 18) (23, 13) (23, 27) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 13) (24, 7) (24, 27) (24, 5) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 0) (5, 24) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 22) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 21) (22, 11) (27, 14) (27, 23) (27, 24) (27, 13) (13, 23) (13, 10) (13, 27) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<6, (9, 28, 10)>
<9, (6, 8, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 29, 10)>
<20, (2, 25, 16)>
<25, (29, 28, 26)>
<28, (6, 25, 29)>
<29, (3, 25, 14)>
<18, (23, 27, 19)>
<19, (26, 8, 10)>
<26, (19, 14, 15)>
<12, (15, 5, 11)>
<15, (26, 12, 5)>
<7, (1, 24, 27)>
<8, (9, 19, 17)>
<14, (29, 26, 27)>
<16, (21, 2, 5)>
<21, (16, 22, 2)>
<2, (20, 16, 21)>
<17, (3, 8, 11)>
<23, (18, 13, 27)>
<0, (6, 26, 5)>
<10, (6, 3, 19)>
<24, (7, 27, 5)>
<5, (12, 16, 0)>
<11, (12, 17, 22)>
<22, (1, 8, 21)>
<27, (14, 23, 24)>
<13, (23, 10, 27)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars we found: [<28>]
