Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 22) (14, 24) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 15) (8, 22) (8, 27) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 10) (12, 17) (12, 27) (12, 11) (12, 15) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 24) (27, 23) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 0) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 28) (0, 23) (0, 21) (21, 0) (21, 28) (21, 26) (21, 18) (21, 25) (28, 20) (28, 21) (28, 25) (11, 12) (4, 27) (4, 15) (4, 29) (7, 20) (25, 21) (25, 28) (25, 26) (25, 19) (29, 20) (29, 4) (29, 9) (29, 16) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 2) (5, 22) (26, 21) (26, 25) (6, 15) (6, 24) (6, 1) (6, 19) (24, 14) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 16) (2, 9) (1, 6) (1, 18) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 16) (3, 17) (3, 23) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 24) (16, 18) (22, 14) (22, 8) (22, 5) (19, 25) (19, 6) (10, 13) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <13, (14, 17, 16)>
2. <12, (17, 15, 27)>
3. <27, (8, 12, 24)>
4. <15, (17, 12, 20)>
5. <20, (15, 28, 29)>
6. <0, (23, 21, 14)>
7. <21, (0, 28, 25)>
8. <28, (20, 21, 25)>
9. <6, (15, 24, 19)>
10. <24, (1, 16, 6)>
11. <9, (29, 18, 2)>
12. <18, (1, 21, 16)>
13. <16, (13, 29, 24)>
14. <22, (5, 8, 14)>
