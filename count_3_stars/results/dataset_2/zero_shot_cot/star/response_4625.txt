Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

There are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them:

<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<4, (7, 14, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<10, (11, 3, 14)>
<11, (10, 3, 13)>
<13, (8, 12, 2)>
<6, (5, 4, 11)>
<2, (10, 8, 13)>
<0, (5, 13, 14)>
<3, (7, 10, 11)>
<1, (6, 2, 0)>
<12, (11, 13, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get: [12].
