Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

There are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's list them:

<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 4, 2)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (8, 0, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<8, (5, 6, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
