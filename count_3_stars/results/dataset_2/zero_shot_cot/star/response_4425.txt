Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 7) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

A 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<5, (8, 3, 7)>
<9, (4, 14, 1)>
<10, (1, 13, 14)>
<11, (1, 0, 6)>
<6, (11, 14, 7)>
<2, (8, 12, 4)>
<12, (9, 2, 0)>
<1, (9, 10, 11)>
<14, (9, 10, 6)>
<13, (10, 3, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
