Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) 

Response:
Let's locate the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (0, 5, 9)>
2. <3, (8, 9, 13)>
3. <8, (3, 4, 6)>
4. <11, (0, 12, 14)>
5. <12, (8, 11, 13)>
6. <13, (3, 4, 12)>
7. <0, (1, 5, 7)>
8. <2, (1, 7, 11)>
9. <10, (3, 9, 14)>
10. <14, (10, 11, 12)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [10].
