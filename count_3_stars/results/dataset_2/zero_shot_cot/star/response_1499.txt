Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars.

The central node must have exactly three edges connected to it in order to form a 3-star. We can identify the central node by counting the nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges.

Nodes with exactly 3 incident edges: 5, 1, 3, 6, 7

Now, let's identify the leaves connected to each central node:

<5, (2, 4, 0)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (3, 4, 0)>
<7, (1, 8)>

So, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [5].
