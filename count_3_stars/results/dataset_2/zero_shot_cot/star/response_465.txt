Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 10) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 1) (8, 15) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 19) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 12) (12, 1) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 17) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 8) (19, 13) (19, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 adjacent edges.
Nodes with 3 adjacent edges: 7, 10, 15

Step 2: Construct 3-stars centered at nodes found in Step 1.
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<10, (0, 11, 14)>
<15, (3, 7, 16)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
Total number of 3-stars: [3]
