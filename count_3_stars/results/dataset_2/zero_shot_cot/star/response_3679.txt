Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 29) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 11) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 24) (27, 6) (6, 7) (6, 27) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 16) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 21) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 13) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 20) (21, 13) (21, 28) (21, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 3) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 2) (20, 26) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (10, 2) (10, 23) (10, 25) (23, 10) (23, 29) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 5) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 25) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 25) (25, 10) (25, 19) (25, 9) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 5) (2, 24) (2, 10) (29, 22) (29, 27) (29, 23) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 1) (18, 21) (18, 3) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[<13, (22, 21, 9)>, <22, (13, 11, 0)>, <4, (9, 0, -)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <14, (17, 16, -)>, <17, (14, 28, 11)>, <12, (27, -, -)>, <27, (12, 29, 24)>, <6, (7, 27, 28)>, <28, (17, 6, 21)>, <1, (26, 16, -)>, <26, (13, 1, 24)>, <21, (13, 28, 18)>, <3, (11, 19, 18)>, <11, (22, 17, 6)>, <24, (27, 26, 8)>, <20, (26, -, -)>, <0, (22, 4, 7)>, <10, (2, 23, 25)>, <23, (10, 29, -)>, <15, (19, 8, 5)>, <19, (3, 15, 25)>, <5, (0, 15, 8)>, <9, (13, 4, 7)>, <25, (10, 19, 9)>, <8, (24, 15, 5)>, <2, (24, 10, -)>, <29, (22, 27, 23)>, <16, (14, 6, 1)>, <18, (21, 3, -)>, <0, (22, 4, 5)>, <26, (13, 1, 20)>, <22, (13, 22, 0)>]

There are [33] 3-stars in the given graph.
