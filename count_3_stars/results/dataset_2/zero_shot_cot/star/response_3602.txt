Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, making them eligible to be the center of a 3-star. The nodes are 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, 2, 0, 1, and 3.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 5: (5, 9, 1), (5, 3, 7) [2]
- For node 9: (9, 4, 2), (9, 3, 7) [2]
- For node 4: (4, 9, 3) [1]
- For node 7: (7, 5, 1), (7, 3, 0) [2]
- For node 8: (8, 5, 6), (8, 2, 6) [2]
- For node 2: (2, 9, 6), (2, 8, 1) [2]
- For node 0: (0, 7, 6), (0, 3, 1) [2]
- For node 1: (1, 5, 6), (1, 2, 0) [2]
- For node 3: (3, 9, 0), (3, 4, 7) [2]

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
