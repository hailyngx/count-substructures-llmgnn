Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

Let's list the central nodes along with their connected nodes:
- Central Node 0: (10, 14, 6)
- Central Node 1: (5, 6, 4)
- Central Node 2: (6, 4, 12)
- Central Node 3: (11, 5, 7)
- Central Node 4: (9, 1, 2)
- Central Node 5: (1, 6, 13)
- Central Node 6: (2, 0, 5)
- Central Node 7: (3, 13, 9)
- Central Node 8: (3, 0, 12)
- Central Node 9: (4, 12, 14)
- Central Node 10: (0, 11, 14)
- Central Node 11: (10, 3, 13)
- Central Node 12: (2, 0, 8)
- Central Node 13: (5, 11, 7)
- Central Node 14: (10, 11, 9)

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (10, 14, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 4)>
- <2, (6, 4, 12)>
- <3, (11, 5, 7)>
- <4, (9, 1, 2)>
- <5, (1, 6, 13)>
- <6, (2, 0, 5)>
- <7, (3, 13, 9)>
- <8, (3, 0, 12)>
- <9, (4, 12, 14)>
- <10, (0, 11, 14)>
- <11, (10, 3, 13)>
- <12, (2, 0, 8)>
- <13, (5, 11, 7)>
- <14, (10, 11, 9)>

Hence, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [15].
