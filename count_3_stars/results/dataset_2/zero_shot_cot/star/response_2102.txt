Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (10, 8) (10, 19) (11, 7) (11, 13) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 5) (9, 15) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 13) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 12) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 3) (15, 2) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. Look for nodes with exactly 3 incident edges (leaves of the 3-stars).
2. Count the number of 3-stars based on these nodes being the center and the leaves.

Nodes with exactly 3 incident edges: 2, 8, 12, 16, 18.

Counting the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has incident edges with nodes 3, 15, 18: <2, (3, 15, 18)>
- Node 8 has incident edges with nodes 4, 5, 10: <8, (4, 5, 10)>
- Node 12 has incident edges with nodes 0, 7, 19: <12, (0, 7, 19)>
- Node 16 has incident edges with nodes 12, 14, 18: <16, (12, 14, 18)>
- Node 18 has incident edges with nodes 0, 1, 16: <18, (0, 1, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
