Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has a 3-star: <0, (9, 4, 8)>
- Node 2 has a 3-star: <2, (6, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 has a 3-star: <4, (6, 9, 8)>
- Node 5 has a 3-star: <5, (4, 0, 1)>
- Node 7 has a 3-star: <7, (9, 0, 2)>

Counting the 3-stars found, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
