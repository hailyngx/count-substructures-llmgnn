Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, which could potentially form a 3-star. 

Looking at the given edges, we find the following nodes with three edges connected to them:
- Node 5 : (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 3)
- Node 9 : (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 0)
- Node 6 : (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 4), (6, 0)
- Node 1 : (1, 9), (1, 7)
- Node 3 : (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 2), (3, 8)
- Node 4 : (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 0)
- Node 7 : (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 0), (7, 8)
- Node 8 : (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 7), (8, 0)
- Node 0 : (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 8)
- Node 2 : (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 3)

From the identified nodes, we can see that nodes 5, 9, and 6 form 3-star structures. Let's count the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<6, (3, 2, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 0)>
<6, (4, 0, 3)>
<6, (0, 8, 7)>
<6, (8, 7, 9)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
