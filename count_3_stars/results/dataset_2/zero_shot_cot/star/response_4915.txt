Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 9) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (6, 14, 4)>
<2, (12, 13, 1)>
<4, (6, 0, 14)>
<5, (13, 10, 7)>
<6, (0, 14, 4)>
<7, (5, 10, 13)>
<8, (14, 3, 9)>
<9, (7, 12, 1)>
<10, (5, 13, 3)>
<12, (6, 2, 11)>
<13, (5, 7, 2)>
<14, (0, 8, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
