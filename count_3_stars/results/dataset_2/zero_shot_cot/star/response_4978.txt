Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<5, (6, 0, 7)>
<9, (2, 1, 0)>
<4, (7, 0, 12)>
<7, (5, 4, 3)>
<8, (13, 2, 10)>
<13, (7, 8, 11)>
<6, (5, 7, 1)>
<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<12, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<11, (13, 6, 0)>
<10, (8, 2, 3)>

There are [12] unique 3-stars in total.
