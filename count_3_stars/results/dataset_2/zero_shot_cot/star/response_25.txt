Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars:

1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2)
   <5, (9, 6, 2)>

2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4)
   <9, (5, 6, 4)>

3. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 3)
   <6, (5, 9, 3)>

4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 5)
   <3, (1, 4, 5)>

5. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3)
   <4, (9, 1, 3)>

6. Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 2)
   <7, (5, 0, 2)>

7. Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 1), (8, 4)
   <8, (6, 1, 4)>

8. Node 0: (0, 7), (0, 2), (0, 5)
   <0, (7, 2, 5)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
