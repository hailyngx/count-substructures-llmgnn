Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars in the graph. 
From the given edges, we can see the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 9, 10, 7)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 10, 13, 0)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 10, 11, 12)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 6, 11, 7)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 9, 11, 0)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 9, 11, 3)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

1. <2, (9, 10, 7)>
2. <3, (10, 13, 0)>
3. <4, (10, 11, 12)>
4. <5, (6, 11, 7)>
5. <8, (9, 11, 0)>
6. <13, (9, 11, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
