Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 14) (16, 6) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 1) (15, 3) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 7) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 0) (13, 9) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 8) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with exactly 3 incident edges are the potential central nodes. Based on the given edges, we identify the following central nodes and their incident edges: 

1. Node 11 (connected to nodes 16, 7, 5)
2. Node 16 (connected to nodes 11, 18, 14)
3. Node 5 (connected to nodes 11, 9, 19)
4. Node 9 (connected to nodes 5, 4, 3)
5. Node 14 (connected to nodes 16, 6, 4)
6. Node 10 (connected to nodes 17, 1, 19)
7. Node 3 (connected to nodes 9, 15)
8. Node 6 (connected to nodes 16, 14, 8)
9. Node 15 (connected to nodes 1, 3)
10. Node 18 (connected to nodes 16, 17, 7)
11. Node 7 (connected to nodes 11, 2, 18)
12. Node 19 (connected to nodes 5, 10, 12)
13. Node 4 (connected to nodes 9, 14)
14. Node 0 (connected to nodes 6, 19, 8)

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The number of 3-stars: 
Consider all unique combinations of 3 leaves for each central node. Then, we will combine each central node with its corresponding unique leaf combinations. 

The total number of 3-stars is [8]. 

<11, (16, 7, 5)>
<16, (11, 18, 14)>
<5, (11, 9, 19)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<14, (16, 6, 4)>
<10, (17, 1, 19)>
<6, (16, 14, 8)>
<19, (5, 10, 12)>
