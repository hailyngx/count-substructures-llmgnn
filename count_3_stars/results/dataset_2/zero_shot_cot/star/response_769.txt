Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 1) 

Response:
At first glance, it may seem a bit overwhelming to count all the 3-stars in the given graph. However, we can simplify the process by focusing on the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5 is connected to 5, 6, 11, 12, and 13.
2. Node 4 is connected to 2, 4, 9, 13, and 14.
3. Node 8 is connected to 0, 1, 10, and 12.
4. Node 6 is connected to 0, 2, 3, 5, and 10.
5. Node 2 is connected to 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7.
6. Node 14 is connected to 4, 5, 7, 9, and 12.
7. Node 3 is connected to 2, 3, 6, and 13.
8. Node 11 is connected to 5, 9, and 14.
9. Node 13 is connected to 3, 4, and 5.
10. Node 7 is connected to 2, 7, 10, and 14.
11. Node 1 is connected to 0, 1, 8, and 10.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
[<5, (6, 11, 12)>, <4, (2, 9, 14)>, <8, (0, 1, 12)>, <6, (0, 2, 10)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <14, (4, 7, 12)>, <3, (2, 6, 13)>, <11, (9, 5, 14)>, <13, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 10, 14)>, <1, (0, 8, 10)>]
