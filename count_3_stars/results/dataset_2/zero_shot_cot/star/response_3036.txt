Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 18) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 12) (2, 12) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 5) (19, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 7) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 18) (12, 2) (12, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (11, 18, 1)>
<5, (9, 15, 19)>
<7, (10, 1, 3)>
<8, (17, 0, 7)>
<9, (5, 15, 14)>
<10, (7, 13, 14)>
<11, (18, 6, 4)>
<12, (18, 15, 2)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [8].
