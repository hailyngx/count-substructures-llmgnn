Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 19) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 18) (19, 15) (17, 6) (17, 8) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 16) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves). 

Let's go through each node and determine if it is the central node of a 3-star:
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 7) -> <0, (1, 7, 7)>
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 13) -> <1, (0, 8, 13)>
- Node 2: (2, 12), (2, 14), (2, 16) -> <2, (12, 14, 16)>
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 13) -> <3, (4, 8, 13)>
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7) -> <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 16) -> <5, (4, 7, 16)>
- Node 6: (6, 14), (6, 17) -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 18) -> <7, (4, 5, 18)>
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 15) -> <8, (1, 3, 15)>
- Node 9: (9, 12), (9, 13), (9, 18) -> <9, (12, 13, 18)>
- Node 10: (10, 11), (10, 14), (10, 18) -> <10, (11, 14, 18)>
- Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 14) -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 12: (12, 2), (12, 9) -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 13: (13, 1), (13, 3), (13, 9) -> <13, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 14: (14, 2), (14, 10), (14, 11) -> <14, (2, 10, 11)>
- Node 15: (15, 8), (15, 19) -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 16: (16, 2), (16, 5), (16, 7) -> <16, (2, 5, 7)>
- Node 17: (17, 6), (17, 8) -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 18: (18, 7), (18, 9), (18, 10), (18, 19) -> <18, (7, 9, 10)>
- Node 19: (19, 15), (19, 18) -> Not a central node of a 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 13)>, <2, (12, 14, 16)>, <3, (4, 8, 13)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 16)>, <7, (4, 5, 18)>, <8, (1, 3, 15)>, <9, (12, 13, 18)>, <10, (11, 14, 18)>, <13, (1, 3, 9)>, <14, (2, 10, 11)>, <16, (2, 5, 7)>, <18, (7, 9, 10)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [14].
