Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
