Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 12) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

1. At node 2: <2, (7, 1, 3)>
2. At node 5: <5, (6, 4, 10)>
3. At node 8: <8, (11, 2, 3)>
4. At node 13: <13, (12, 5, 9)>
5. At node 0: <0, (8, 1, 9)>
6. At node 9: <9, (12, 10, 0)>

[The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is 6.]
