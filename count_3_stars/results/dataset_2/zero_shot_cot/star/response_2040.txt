Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (4, 18) (4, 2) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 19) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 14) (15, 9) (15, 7) (15, 12) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 0) (7, 16) (7, 17) (7, 15) (7, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 19) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.

The potential center nodes are: 16, 5, 9, 3, 8, 1, 17, 18, 19, 15, 12, 7, 10, 0, 14, 2.

Now, let's check which of these potential centers form actual 3-stars. We will consider each potential center and see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given information, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<16, (11, 7, 3)>
<5, (9, 6, 19)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (16, 9, 1)>
<8, (9, 0, 12)>
<1, (13, 17, 3)>
<17, (11, 1, 10)>
<18, (4, 5, 19)>
<19, (18, 5, 14)>
<15, (7, 9, 12)>
<12, (0, 8, 15)>
<7, (16, 17, 15)>
<10, (17, 0, 6)>
<0, (8, 10, 12)>
<14, (19, 7, 14)>
<2, (9, 4, 2)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [15]
