Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 10) (12, 7) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 18) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 11) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 18) (11, 13) (14, 7) (14, 18) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 17) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 10) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 14) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 1) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - <0, (5, 15, 19)>
   - <0, (5, 15, 17)>
   - <0, (19, 1, 15)>
   - <0, (19, 1, 17)>
   - <0, (15, 7, 13)>
   - <0, (17, 2, 15)>
   - <0, (17, 2, 11)>
   (Total: 7)

2. Node 1:
   - <1, (19, 8, 16)>
   - <1, (19, 16, 1)>
   - <1, (19, 8, 10)>
   - <1, (16, 18, 1)>
   - <1, (16, 18, 11)>
   (Total: 5)

3. Node 2:
   - <2, (9, 17, 3)>
   (Total: 1)

4. Node 3:
   - <3, (5, 2, 11)>
   - <3, (5, 2, 17)>
   (Total: 2)

5. Node 4:
   - <4, (8, 1, 16)>
   - <4, (8, 10, 1)>
   (Total: 2)

6. Node 5:
   - <5, (0, 10, 3)>
   - <5, (0, 15, 3)>
   (Total: 2)

7. Node 6:
   - <6, (17, 11, 18)>
   (Total: 1)

8. Node 7:
   - <7, (15, 14, 12)>
   - <7, (15, 14, 18)>
   (Total: 2)

9. Node 8:
   - <8, (4, 19, 10)>
   - <8, (4, 19, 1)>
   (Total: 2)

10. Node 9:
   - <9, (16, 13, 2)>
   - <9, (16, 13, 11)>
   (Total: 2)

11. Node 10:
   - <10, (5, 1, 8)>
   (Total: 1)

12. Node 11:
   - <11, (6, 17, 18)>
   - <11, (6, 17, 3)>
   - <11, (13, 15, 11)>
   (Total: 3)

13. Node 12:
   - <12, (7, 15, 14)>
   (Total: 1)

14. Node 13:
   - <13, (9, 15, 11)>
   - <13, (9, 16, 11)>
   (Total: 2)

15. Node 14:
   - <14, (7, 15, 18)>
   (Total: 1)

16. Node 15:
   - <15, (7, 0, 13)>
   (Total: 1)

17. Node 16:
   - <16, (9, 1, 18)>
   (Total: 1)

18. Node 17:
   - <17, (6, 2, 11)>
   (Total: 1)

19. Node 18:
   - <18, (16, 11, 14)>
   (Total: 1)

20. Node 19:
   - <19, (8, 0, 1)>
   (Total: 1)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
