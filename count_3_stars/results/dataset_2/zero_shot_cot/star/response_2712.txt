Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
Node 0: 1, 4, 11, 14
Node 1: 0, 13, 14
Node 2: 3, 9, 10, 12
Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 12
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 11, 12
Node 5: 4, 9, 10, 14
Node 6: 8, 10, 13
Node 7: 3, 8, 11, 14
Node 8: 6, 7, 9, 11, 13
Node 9: 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 10: 2, 5, 6
Node 11: 0, 4, 7, 8, 14
Node 12: 2, 3, 4
Node 13: 1, 6, 8
Node 14: 0, 1, 5, 7, 11

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 14. (<0, 1, 4, 14>)
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 13, 14. (<1, 0, 13, 14>)
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 9, 10. (<2, 3, 9, 10>)
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 12. (<3, 2, 4, 12>)
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 3, 5. (<4, 0, 3, 5>)
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, 14. (<5, 4, 9, 14>)
- Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes 8, 10, 13. (<6, 8, 10, 13>)
- Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 8, 11, 14. (<7, 8, 11, 14>)
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, 9. (<8, 6, 7, 9>)
- Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 7. (<9, 2, 5, 7>)
- Node 10 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, 6. (<10, 2, 5, 6>)
- Node 11 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, 14. (<11, 0, 7, 14>)
- Node 12 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 2. (<12, 3, 4, 2>)
- Node 13 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, 8. (<13, 1, 6, 8>)
- Node 14 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 5. (<14, 0, 1, 5>)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
