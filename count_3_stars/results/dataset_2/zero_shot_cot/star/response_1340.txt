Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 2) (4, 2) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 12) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 8) (11, 18) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 12) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 9) (12, 15) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes with exactly three edges, as they are potential centers of 3-star graphs. From the given list of edges, we find the following nodes with three edges each: 14, 17, 1, 6, 11, 19.

We will consider each of these nodes as the potential center of a 3-star graph and count the number of 3-stars around them.

For node 14:
- Nodes connected to 14: 17, 8, 3, 9
  <14, (17, 8, 3)> is a 3-star.
  
For node 17:
- Nodes connected to 17: 14, 16, 8, 2
  <17, (14, 16, 8)> is a 3-star.

For node 1:
- Nodes connected to 1: 0, 6, 10, 12
  <1, (0, 6, 10)> is a 3-star.

For node 6:
- Nodes connected to 6: 16, 1, 15, 8
  <6, (16, 1, 15)> is a 3-star.

For node 11:
- Nodes connected to 11: 18
  It does not form a 3-star.

For node 19:
- Nodes connected to 19: 7, 12
  It does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<14, (17, 8, 3)>, <17, (14, 16, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 10)>, <6, (16, 1, 15)>.
