Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 12) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 8) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 9, 15, 1, 3, 2, 8, 0, and 17.

Next, we will go through each of these nodes and find the 3-stars they are part of:

For node 9:
- <9, (16, 4, 8)>
- <9, (16, 4, 15)>
Total: 2

For node 15:
- <15, (4, 10, 13)>
- <15, (4, 10, 12)>
Total: 2

For node 1:
- <1, (5, 13, 14)>
Total: 1

For node 3:
- No 3-star found

For node 2:
- No 3-star found

For node 8:
- No 3-star found

For node 0:
- No 3-star found

For node 17:
- No 3-star found

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5
Therefore, the final answer is: [5]
