Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 7) (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 16) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 11) (18, 19) (18, 24) (18, 25) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 8) (10, 0) (10, 28) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 23) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 18) (19, 11) (26, 27) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 16) (15, 24) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 2) (11, 21) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 4) (27, 22) (27, 26) (27, 29) (27, 16) (29, 14) (29, 27) (29, 23) (29, 3) (3, 2) (3, 29) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 8) (24, 18) (24, 15) (24, 3) (24, 8) (8, 22) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 12) (25, 1) (25, 18) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 27) (16, 23) (28, 10) (28, 12) (12, 21) (12, 8) (12, 28) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 23) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 3) (23, 16) (23, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- From node 5: <5, (9, 4, 20)>
- From node 9: <9, (5, 13, 6)>
- From node 14: <14, (17, 29, 27)>
- From node 17: <17, (14, 7, 1)>
- From node 1: <1, (21, 25, 16)>
- From node 21: <21, (1, 12, 11)>
- From node 18: <18, (19, 24, 25)>
- From node 22: <22, (27, 20, 8)>
- From node 10: <10, (0, 28, 20)>
- From node 0: <0, (10, 20, 2)>
- From node 20: <20, (5, 22, 0)>
- From node 2: <2, (0, 3, 7)>
- From node 19: <19, (18, 11, 26)>
- From node 26: <26, (27, 19, 16)>
- From node 13: <13, (9, 6, 29)>
- From node 6: <6, (13, 16, 23)>
- From node 15: <15, (24, 16, 23)>
- From node 7: <7, (17, 1, 2)>
- From node 11: <11, (21, 2, 19)>
- From node 27: <27, (22, 26, 29)>
- From node 29: <29, (14, 27, 23)>
- From node 3: <3, (2, 23, 8)>
- From node 24: <24, (18, 15, 3)>
- From node 8: <8, (22, 3, 12)>
- From node 25: <25, (1, 18, 16)>
- From node 16: <16, (1, 6, 27)>
- From node 28: <28, (10, 12, 0)>
- From node 12: <12, (21, 8, 28)>
- From node 4: <4, (5, 11, 23)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
