Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 3) (12, 27) (12, 18) (12, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 17) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 28) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 11) (2, 18) (2, 26) (13, 18) (13, 26) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 20) (26, 0) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 7) (10, 3) (10, 29) (16, 28) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 14) (3, 22) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 24) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (21, 19) (21, 17) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 29) (11, 6) (11, 19) (11, 25) (19, 21) (19, 11) (19, 17) (20, 26) (20, 23) (0, 18) (0, 26) (0, 23) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 14) (14, 28) (14, 9) (25, 15) (25, 5) (25, 11) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 21) (17, 19) (29, 15) (29, 10) (29, 24) (23, 27) (23, 20) (23, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is the center of a 3-star and has exactly three neighbors. 

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<15, (27, 1, 25)>
<27, (15, 12, 23)>
<18, (22, 2, 0)>
<12, (27, 18, 17)>
<22, (18, 6, 3)>
<4, (8, 28, 5)>
<5, (8, 6, 25)>
<8, (4, 28, 17)>
<6, (22, 5, 11)>
<2, (18, 26, 0)>
<13, (18, 26, 0)>
<26, (2, 13, 20)>
<1, (15, 24, 7)>
<10, (3, 29, 24)>
<16, (28, 9, 14)>
<3, (22, 10, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<21, (19, 17, 21)>
<24, (1, 3, 29)>
<11, (6, 19, 25)>
<19, (11, 17, 21)>
<20, (26, 23, 0)>
<0, (18, 26, 23)>
<9, (28, 7, 14)>
<14, (28, 9, 14)>

Therefore, there are 24 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The final answer is [24].
