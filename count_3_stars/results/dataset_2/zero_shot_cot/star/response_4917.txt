Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 2) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 18) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 1) (17, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 19) (10, 2) (10, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 3) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them (leaves of the 3-stars). These nodes are potential central nodes of the 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 3
- Node 9
- Node 11
- Node 12

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (6, 0, 13)>
<3, (6, 0, 13)>
<3, (6, 13, 9)>
<3, (6, 9, 0)>
<3, (0, 11, 6)>
<3, (9, 2, 10)>
<3, (9, 2, 10)>
<9, (2, 17, 3)>
<9, (2, 17, 3)>
<9, (2, 17, 3)>
<9, (2, 17, 3)>
<9, (2, 17, 3)>
<11, (0, 6, 19)>
<12, (17, 14, 18)>
<12, (14, 17, 18)>
<12, (14, 17, 18)>

By counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
