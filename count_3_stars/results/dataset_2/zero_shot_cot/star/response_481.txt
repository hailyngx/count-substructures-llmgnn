Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 18) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 0) (16, 19) (5, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 19) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, we will identify all 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 12)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 18)>
4. <6, (4, 9, 13)>
5. <7, (0, 12, 19)>
6. <9, (0, 6, 13)>
7. <11, (1, 10, 17)>
8. <14, (5, 8, 19)>
9. <17, (11, 19, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
