Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (3, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 1) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (7, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (14, 10, 12)>
<8, (13, 2, 10)>
<9, (15, 11, 14)>
<17, (1, 16, 19)>
