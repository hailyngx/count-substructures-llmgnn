Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (11, 15) (11, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 7) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (1, 10) (1, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 0: (15, 8, 6)
Node 1: (10, 11)
Node 2: (9, 4)
Node 3: (15, 14, 13, 18)
Node 4: (8, 2)
Node 5: (9, 17, 16)
Node 6: (10, 0)
Node 7: (12, 14)
Node 8: (4, 10, 17, 0)
Node 9: (5, 2, 14, 16)
Node 10: (17, 6, 8, 1)
Node 11: (15, 1)
Node 12: (7, 16, 18)
Node 13: (3, 17, 16, 19)
Node 14: (3, 9, 7)
Node 15: (3, 0, 11)
Node 16: (5, 9, 12, 13)
Node 17: (5, 10, 13, 8)
Node 18: (3, 12, 19)
Node 19: (13, 18)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (15, 8, 6)>
<1, (10, 11, 15)>
<2, (9, 4, 14)>
<3, (15, 14, 13)>
<4, (8, 2, 9)>
<5, (9, 17, 16)>
<6, (10, 0, 15)>
<7, (12, 14, 3)>
<8, (4, 10, 17)>
<9, (5, 2, 14)>
<10, (17, 8, 6)>
<11, (15, 1, 11)>
<12, (7, 16, 18)>
<13, (3, 17, 16)>
<14, (3, 9, 7)>
<15, (3, 0, 11)>
<16, (5, 9, 12)>
<17, (5, 10, 13)>
<18, (3, 12, 19)>
<19, (13, 18, 3)>

There are a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
