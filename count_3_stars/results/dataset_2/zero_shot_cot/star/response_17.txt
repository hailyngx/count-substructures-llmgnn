Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 17) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 23) (25, 15) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 12) (15, 25) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 21) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 16) (20, 24) (26, 1) (26, 17) (8, 0) (8, 22) (8, 27) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (19, 18) (19, 0) (5, 10) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 24) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 21) (21, 15) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 9) (14, 7) (14, 22) (14, 23) (22, 8) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 28) (27, 8) (27, 21) (27, 23) (9, 21) (12, 18) (12, 24) (12, 28) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 29) (16, 22) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 12) (24, 28) (24, 23) (23, 25) (23, 14) (23, 27) (23, 24) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 26) (6, 22) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 28) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We will iterate through each node in the graph and identify nodes that satisfy the conditions of being the center of a 3-star. For each such node, we will count the corresponding 3-star. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 15, 8, and 19: <0, (15, 8, 19)>
2. Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 13, 2, and 26: <1, (13, 2, 26)>
3. Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 29, and 14: <7, (4, 29, 14)>
4. Node 15 can form a 3-star with nodes 25, 20, and 21: <15, (25, 20, 21)>
5. Node 16 can form a 3-star with nodes 25, 20, and 29: <16, (25, 20, 29)>
6. Node 22 can form a 3-star with nodes 14, 6, and 28: <22, (14, 6, 28)>
7. Node 24 can form a 3-star with nodes 20, 29, and 12: <24, (20, 29, 12)>
8. Node 25 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 16, and 23: <25, (3, 16, 23)>
9. Node 28 can form a 3-star with nodes 10, 12, and 22: <28, (10, 12, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
