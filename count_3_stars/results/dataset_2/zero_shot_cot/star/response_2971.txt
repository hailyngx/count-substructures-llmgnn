Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 12) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 25) (15, 28) (15, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 29) (12, 26) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 25) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 21) (21, 29) (21, 13) (21, 5) (21, 18) (28, 15) (28, 18) (0, 7) (0, 10) (20, 4) (20, 11) (20, 10) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 20) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 24) (13, 19) (19, 13) (19, 24) (19, 6) (23, 24) (23, 27) (16, 26) (16, 1) (14, 26) (14, 5) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 1) (11, 20) (11, 13) (11, 6) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 23) (1, 16) (1, 25) (1, 2) (1, 22) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (18, 8) (18, 21) (18, 28) (22, 8) (22, 1) (5, 21) (5, 14) (27, 3) (27, 23) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

Let's identify the nodes which are connected to exactly 3 edges: <19>, <23> 

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<19, (13, 24, 6)>
<23, (24, 27, 16)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
