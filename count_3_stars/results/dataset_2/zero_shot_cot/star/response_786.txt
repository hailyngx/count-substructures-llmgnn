Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to identify the 3-stars.

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 12. This forms a 3-star with node 3 as the central node and nodes 1, 2, and 12 as the leaves. (<3, (1, 2, 12)>)

- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. However, it is missing a third connection to form a 3-star.

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 16. This forms a 3-star with node 5 as the central node and nodes 4, 12, and 16 as the leaves. (<5, (4, 12, 16)>)

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 7. While it is part of a 4-star with nodes 2, 6, and 7, it does not participate in a 3-star.

- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 17, and 18. This forms a 3-star with node 10 as the central node and nodes 6, 17, and 18 as the leaves. (<10, (6, 17, 18)>)

- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6 and 17. However, it is missing a third connection to form a 3-star.

- Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 16. This forms a 3-star with node 17 as the central node and nodes 10, 11, and 16 as the leaves. (<17, (10, 11, 16)>)

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 14, and 16. While it is part of a 4-star with nodes 5, 14, and 16, it does not participate in a 3-star.

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 18. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the central node and nodes 2, 4, and 18 as the leaves. (<8, (2, 4, 18)>)

- Node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 10. This forms a 3-star with node 18 as the central node and nodes 7, 8, and 10 as the leaves. (<18, (7, 8, 10)>)

Count of 3-stars: [3]
