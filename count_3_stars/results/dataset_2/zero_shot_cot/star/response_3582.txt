Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 8) (3, 10) (13, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <2, (5, 7, 1)>
- <4, (9, 2, 0)>
- <8, (5, 12, 14)>
- <10, (5, 12, 1)>

Based on our identifications, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
So, the final answer is [4].
