Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 13) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
[There are 8 3-stars in the given graph.]
