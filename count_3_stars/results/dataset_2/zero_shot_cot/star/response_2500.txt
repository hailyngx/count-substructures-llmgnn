Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 0) (2, 29) (2, 5) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 24) (7, 8) (21, 6) (21, 26) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 4) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 8) (8, 7) (8, 25) (8, 23) (8, 18) (23, 13) (23, 8) (23, 1) (23, 0) (23, 12) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 12) (20, 14) (20, 10) (20, 19) (20, 28) (12, 23) (12, 10) (12, 15) (12, 18) (11, 19) (11, 9) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 9) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 4) (16, 29) (16, 15) (16, 28) (5, 2) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 18) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 19) (18, 26) (26, 21) (26, 18) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 6) (0, 22) (0, 23) (0, 15) (0, 9) (9, 11) (9, 28) (9, 0) (9, 27) (24, 29) (24, 14) (24, 27) (27, 17) (27, 9) (27, 24) (4, 17) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the nodes along with their degrees:

Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 2
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 4
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 5
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 4
Node 17: degree 4
Node 18: degree 5
Node 19: degree 5
Node 20: degree 4
Node 21: degree 2
Node 22: degree 2
Node 23: degree 5
Node 24: degree 3
Node 25: degree 4
Node 26: degree 2
Node 27: degree 3
Node 28: degree 3
Node 29: degree 4

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<13, (22, 23, 0)>
<2, (29, 5, 16)>
<29, (2, 24, 16)>
<7, (8, 25, 23)>
<21, (6, 26, 18)>
<14, (17, 18, 24)>
<17, (14, 19, 27)>
<3, (25, 1, 8)>
<25, (3, 8, 1)>
<8, (7, 23, 25)>
<23, (13, 8, 0)>
<10, (12, 20, 15)>
<15, (16, 0, 12)>
<20, (14, 10, 19)>
<12, (23, 10, 15)>
<11, (19, 9, 5)>
<28, (20, 16, 9)>
<6, (21, 1, 4)>
<16, (29, 15, 28)>
<5, (2, 19, 11)>
<19, (17, 20, 5)>
<18, (14, 8, 19)>
<26, (21, 18, 6)>
<1, (25, 23, 6)>
<0, (22, 15, 9)>
<9, (11, 28, 0)>
<24, (29, 14, 27)>
<27, (17, 9, 24)>
<4, (17, 6, 19)>

There are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
