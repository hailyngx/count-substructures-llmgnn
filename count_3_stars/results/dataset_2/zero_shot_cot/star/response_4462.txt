The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 7) (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 18) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 26) (6, 19) (9, 22) (9, 6) (9, 15) (0, 27) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 23) (27, 13) (27, 0) (27, 19) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 20) (15, 8) (20, 15) (21, 4) (21, 24) (28, 14) (28, 25) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 12) (17, 22) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 16) (5, 25) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 27) (19, 24) (8, 0) (8, 15) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 16) (12, 1) (12, 4) (25, 0) (25, 28) (25, 17) (25, 5) (10, 26) (10, 14) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 3) (11, 22) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 4) (24, 11) (3, 26) (3, 14) (14, 28) (14, 10) (14, 3) (18, 29) (18, 11) (23, 0) (23, 7) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 4) (7, 22) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. 

Given the edges provided, the central nodes will be those nodes which have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's identify those:

- Node 22 has 5 edges connected to it: (13, 22), (22, 9), (22, 11), (22, 17), (22, 7)
- Node 9 has 3 edges connected to it: (9, 22), (9, 6), (9, 15)
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected to it: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 26), (6, 19)
- Node 27 has 3 edges connected to it: (27, 13), (27, 0), (27, 19)
- Node 15 has 4 edges connected to it: (15, 2), (15, 9), (15, 20), (15, 8)
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected to it: (2, 29), (2, 17), (2, 15)
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected to it: (1, 17), (1, 16), (1, 12)
- Node 17 has 5 edges connected to it: (17, 22), (17, 2), (17, 1), (17, 25), (17, 16)
- Node 24 has 4 edges connected to it: (24, 21), (24, 19), (24, 4), (24, 11)
- Node 16 has 4 edges connected to it: (16, 29), (16, 1), (16, 17), (16, 4)
- Node 26 has 3 edges connected to it: (26, 6), (26, 10), (26, 3)
- Node 11 has 3 edges connected to it: (11, 22), (11, 24), (11, 18)
- Node 14 has 3 edges connected to it: (14, 28), (14, 10), (14, 3)
- Node 18 has 2 edges connected to it: (18, 29), (18, 11)
- Node 23 has 2 edges connected to it: (23, 0), (23, 7)
- Node 5 has 3 edges connected to it: (5, 25), (5, 7), (7, 5)
- Node 10 has 2 edges connected to it: (10, 26), (10, 14)
- Node 21 has 2 edges connected to it: (21, 4), (21, 24)

- Node 25 has 4 edges connected to it: (25, 0), (25, 28), (25, 17), (25, 5)
- Node 19 has 3 edges connected to it: (19, 6), (19, 27), (19, 24)
- Node 3 has 2 edges connected to it: (3, 26), (3, 14)
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected to it: (4, 21), (4, 12), (4, 24), (4, 16)
- Node 0 has 4 edges connected to it: (0, 27), (0, 25), (0, 8), (0, 23)
- Node 29 has 3 edges connected to it: (29, 2), (29, 16), (29, 18)
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it: (7, 22), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 23)

From the list above, the central nodes are: 22, 9, 6, 27, 15, 2, 1, 17, 24, 16, 26, 11, 14, 5, 10, 21, 8, 12, 25, 19, 3, 4, 0, 29, 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
