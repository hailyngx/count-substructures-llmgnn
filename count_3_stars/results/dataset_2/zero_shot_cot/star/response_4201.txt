Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 26) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 18) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 14) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 28) (27, 5) (10, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 26) (0, 2) (0, 29) (20, 29) (20, 1) (9, 22) (9, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (5, 27) (5, 25) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 4) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 24) (8, 3) (8, 25) (8, 11) (18, 3) (18, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 15) (26, 4) (16, 2) (16, 21) (16, 6) (21, 13) (21, 22) (21, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (24, 15) (24, 14) (6, 22) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 6) (4, 19) (4, 26) (4, 6) (25, 5) (25, 8) (28, 2) (28, 27) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 29, 16, and 28, forming the 3-star <2, (29, 16, 28)>.
2. Node 22 is connected to nodes 13, 21, and 9, forming the 3-star <22, (13, 21, 9)>.
3. Node 29 is connected to nodes 2, 20, and 19, forming the 3-star <29, (2, 20, 19)>.
4. Node 12 is connected to nodes 27, 10, and 14, forming the 3-star <12, (27, 10, 14)>.
5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 12, 17, and 15, forming the 3-star <10, (12, 17, 15)>.
6. Node 4 is connected to nodes 19, 26, and 6, forming the 3-star <4, (19, 26, 6)>.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 22, 16, and 14, forming the 3-star <6, (22, 16, 14)>.
8. Node 14 is connected to nodes 23, 12, and 18, forming the 3-star <14, (23, 12, 18)>.

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [8].
