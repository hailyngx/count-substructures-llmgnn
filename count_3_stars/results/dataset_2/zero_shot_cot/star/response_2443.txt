Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (9, 1, 7)>
<8, (7, 2, 6)>
<0, (7, 6, 0)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
