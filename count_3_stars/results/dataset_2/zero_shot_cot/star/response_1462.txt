Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 26) (5, 22) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 14) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 28) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 11) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 27) (10, 17) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 1) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 15) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 0) (7, 29) (7, 0) (7, 16) (0, 23) (0, 27) (0, 7) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 12) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 11) (3, 17) (21, 2) (21, 6) (21, 24) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 1) (19, 6) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 25) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 7) (16, 25) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 19) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 18) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 21) (24, 20) (20, 4) (20, 24) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 15) (11, 18) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 26) (25, 16) (18, 1) (18, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<8, (13, 19, 24)>
<13, (8, 28, 19)>
<19, (8, 13, 25)>
<24, (4, 8, 21)>
<28, (13, 29, 12)>
<4, (24, 20, 11)>
<20, (4, 24, 11)>
<11, (4, 20, 18)>
<18, (1, 11, 19)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph inside brackets []:
