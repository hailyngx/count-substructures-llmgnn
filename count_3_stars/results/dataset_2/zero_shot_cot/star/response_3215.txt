Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 27) (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 2) (14, 28) (17, 20) (17, 7) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 12) (22, 7) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 27) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 11) (13, 10) (15, 18) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 29) (27, 26) (27, 8) (27, 15) (27, 29) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (4, 8) (4, 28) (11, 13) (11, 28) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 11) (28, 5) (20, 17) (20, 29) (7, 17) (7, 22) (7, 25) (7, 3) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 6) (25, 24) (29, 9) (29, 15) (29, 27) (29, 20) (16, 12) (16, 24) (16, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (12, 18) (12, 16) (24, 9) (24, 25) (24, 16) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 23) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 28) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 23) (23, 6) (23, 10) (2, 21) (2, 16) (2, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-star structures in the graph are:
<8, (9, 13, 27)>
<13, (8, 21, 25)>
<15, (18, 27, 29)>
<18, (9, 12, 15)>
<27, (8, 15, 29)>
<28, (4, 5, 11)>
<21, (1, 2, 13)>
<1, (0, 5, 21)>
<25, (7, 13, 24)>
<29, (9, 15, 27)>
<12, (16, 18, 24)>
<24, (9, 16, 25)>
<16, (2, 12, 24)>
<5, (0, 1, 28)>
<7, (3, 17, 25)>
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (10, 16, 21)>
<10, (2, 13, 23)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (19, 23, 25)>
<4, (8, 11, 28)>
<11, (4, 13, 28)>
<20, (17, 29)>
<19, (6, 15)>
<23, (6, 10)>
<22, (7)>

After listing all the 3-stars, we count them and put the number in square brackets:
[25]
