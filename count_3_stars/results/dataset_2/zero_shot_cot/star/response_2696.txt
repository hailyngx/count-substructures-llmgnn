Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <5, (9, 6, 2)>
- <9, (5, 6, 3)>
- <4, (7, 8, 0)>
- <7, (9, 4, 0)>
- <1, (5, 3, 6)>
- <3, (9, 4, 1)>
- <6, (5, 9, 1)>
- <8, (5, 4, 2)>
- <2, (5, 1, 8)>
- <0, (5, 4, 7)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
[10]
