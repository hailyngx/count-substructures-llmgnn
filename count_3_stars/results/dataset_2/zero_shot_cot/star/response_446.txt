Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 2) (27, 12) (27, 5) (27, 13) (27, 16) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 18) (2, 15) (2, 29) (2, 14) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 14) (3, 6) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 10) (25, 3) (25, 28) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 21) (22, 9) (22, 18) (22, 7) (22, 1) (12, 27) (12, 18) (12, 11) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 16) (20, 15) (20, 24) (20, 10) (0, 26) (14, 2) (14, 29) (1, 22) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 7) (17, 5) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 1) (21, 18) (21, 26) (21, 5) (13, 27) (13, 6) (13, 4) (26, 0) (26, 21) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 23) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 20) (11, 18) (11, 12) (11, 19) (24, 8) (24, 20) (28, 25) (28, 1) (16, 27) (16, 8) (16, 1) (23, 19) (5, 27) (5, 17) (5, 21) 

Response:
At first, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 15: {<15, (20, 8, 2)>}
- From node 27: {<27, (12, 5, 13)>}
- From node 6: {<6, (9, 10, 3)>}
- From node 9: {<9, (6, 22, 18)>}
- From node 2: {<2, (15, 29, 14)>}
- From node 29: {<29, (2, 19, 14)>}
- From node 3: {<3, (6, 25, 7)>}
- From node 25: {<25, (3, 28, 25)>}
- From node 18: {<18, (9, 22, 11)>, <18, (22, 12, 21)>}
- From node 22: {<22, (9, 18, 7)>, <22, (18, 1, 7)>}
- From node 12: {<12, (27, 18, 11)>}
- From node 4: {<4, (2, 8, 13)>}
- From node 8: {<8, (15, 4, 19)>, <8, (4, 24, 16)>}
- From node 20: {<20, (15, 24, 10)>}
- From node 14: {<14, (2, 29, 14)>}
- From node 1: {<1, (22, 16, 28)>, <1, (16, 7, 1)>}
- From node 7: {<7, (3, 22, 1)>}
- From node 21: {<21, (18, 26, 5)>, <21, (5, 17, 21)>}
- From node 13: {<13, (27, 6, 4)>}
- From node 0: {<0, (26, 21, 0)>}
- From node 19: {<19, (29, 8, 11)>, <19, (8, 23, 19)>}
- From node 10: {<10, (6, 3, 20)>}
- From node 11: {<11, (18, 12, 19)>}
- From node 24: {<24, (8, 20, 10)>}
- From node 28: {<28, (25, 1, 28)>}
- From node 16: {<16, (27, 8, 1)>}
- From node 23: {<23, (19, 23, 19)}


Now, count the total number of 3-stars found: [26]
