Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 14) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

- Central node 6 has leaves 9, 7, and 12.
- Central node 9 has leaves 6, 4, and 10.
- Central node 1 has leaves 3, 14, 10, and 13.
- Central node 3 has leaves 1, 5, and 8.
- Central node 10 has leaves 9, 1, and 11.
- Central node 11 has leaves 10, 5, and 12.
- Central node 0 has leaves 10, 2, 7, 5, and 8.
- Central node 2 has leaves 10, 0, 8, and 12.
- Central node 8 has leaves 3, 0, 2, 5, and 12.
- Central node 5 has leaves 3, 11, 0, 8, and 7.
- Central node 13 has leaves 9 and 1.
- Central node 7 has leaves 6, 9, 1, 0, and 5.
- Central node 4 has leaves 9 and 1.
- Central node 12 has leaves 6, 11, 2, 8, and 14.
- Central node 14 has leaves 1 and 12.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars.

<6, (9, 7, 12)> 
<9, (6, 4, 10)>
<1, (3, 14, 10)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<10, (9, 1, 11)>
<11, (10, 5, 12)>
<0, (10, 2, 7)>
<2, (10, 0, 8)>
<8, (3, 0, 2)>
<5, (3, 11, 7)>
<13, (9, 1)>
<7, (6, 9, 5)>
<4, (9, 1)>
<12, (6, 11, 2)>
<14, (1, 12)>
