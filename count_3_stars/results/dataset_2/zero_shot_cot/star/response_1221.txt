Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 15) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 18) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 9) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 15) (9, 17) (9, 19) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 6) (18, 8) (18, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 15) 

Response:
We will identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph.

Let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 5, 16)>
<1, (0, 14, 19)>
<2, (6, 15, 17)>
<4, (8, 11, 15)>
<5, (0, 8, 10)>
<6, (2, 12, 15)>
<7, (13, 14, 17)>
<8, (4, 5, 18)>
<9, (16, 17, 19)>
<10, (5, 15, 19)>
<11, (4, 15, 19)>
<12, (2, 6, 15)>
<13, (5, 7, 17)>
<14, (0, 1, 7)>
<15, (2, 4, 6)>
<16, (0, 1, 17)>
<17, (2, 7, 13)>
<18, (8, 16, 19)>
<19, (1, 9, 11)>

There are 19 unique 3-star patterns in the given graph.
