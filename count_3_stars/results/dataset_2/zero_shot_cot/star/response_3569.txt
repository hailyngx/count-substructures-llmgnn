Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 15) (12, 21) (12, 29) (12, 6) (27, 28) (27, 17) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 5) (18, 20) (17, 10) (17, 27) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 6) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 26) (21, 12) (21, 20) (28, 27) (28, 9) (28, 22) (1, 29) (1, 19) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 20) (7, 15) (25, 19) (20, 18) (20, 21) (20, 26) (20, 29) (20, 22) (29, 12) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 23) (23, 11) (23, 26) (23, 29) (23, 24) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 16) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 24) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 15) (13, 4) (13, 3) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 16) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 16) (22, 11) (22, 28) (22, 20) (9, 28) (9, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (16, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 10, which will be the central node in potential 3-stars. The nodes connected to node 10 are nodes 11, 17, and 4. 

Now, let's check for each of these potential 3-stars if they indeed form a 3-star. 

1. For node 10:
- (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 4) are connected, forming a 3-star. <10, (11, 17, 4)>

2. For node 11:
- (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 22) are not connected. Not a 3-star.

3. For node 17:
- (17, 10) (17, 27) (17, 2) are connected, forming a 3-star. <17, (10, 27, 2)>
- (17, 4) is connected, but the other two edges don't form a 3-star. Not a 3-star.

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique 3-star found is <10, (11, 17, 4)>.
