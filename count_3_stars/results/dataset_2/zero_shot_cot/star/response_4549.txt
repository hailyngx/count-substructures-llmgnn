Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 6) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, letâ€™s find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes with 3 connections are: 0, 2, 7, 12, and 14.

For each of these nodes, we need to identify the 3-stars they are a center of. 
Let's go through each potential center node one by one:

For node 0:
- Nodes connected to 0: 5, 8, 2, 4
- 3-stars with node 0 as the center: 
  <0, (5, 8, 2)>
  <0, (5, 8, 4)>

For node 2:
- Nodes connected to 2: 3, 6, 0
- 3-stars with node 2 as the center: 
  <2, (3, 6, 0)>

For node 7:
- Nodes connected to 7: 5, 9, 14
- 3-stars with node 7 as the center: 
  <7, (5, 9, 14)>

For node 12:
- Nodes connected to 12: 9, 11, 8, 6
- 3-stars with node 12 as the center: 
  <12, (9, 11, 8)>
  <12, (9, 11, 6)>
  <12, (9, 8, 6)>

For node 14: 
- Nodes connected to 14: 1, 11, 8, 7
- 3-stars with node 14 as the center: 
  <14, (1, 11, 8)>
  <14, (1, 11, 7)>
  <14, (1, 8, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: 7
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 2)>
<0, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (3, 6, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 14)>
<12, (9, 11, 8)>
<12, (9, 11, 6)>
<12, (9, 8, 6)>
