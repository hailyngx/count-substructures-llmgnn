Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 16) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 8) (17, 12) (29, 19) (29, 22) (29, 12) (29, 24) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 8) (21, 22) (28, 21) (28, 27) (28, 25) (13, 0) (26, 5) (26, 16) (26, 4) (15, 22) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 16) (25, 28) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 0) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 24) (27, 18) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 8) (0, 21) (0, 13) (0, 25) (0, 18) (10, 3) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 20) (14, 11) (14, 24) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 27) (18, 0) (2, 23) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 29) (12, 19) (20, 11) (20, 23) (4, 26) (4, 2) (19, 9) (19, 29) (19, 21) (19, 12) (24, 29) (24, 27) (24, 14) (24, 22) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 15) (22, 11) (22, 24) (23, 25) (23, 2) (23, 20) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes connected in the specific star pattern. 

Let's go ahead and identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Looking at the given edges, we find the following 3-stars:
   - <<0, (21, 25, 28)>>
   - <<1, (3, 12, 18)>>
   - <<2, (4, 23, 27)>>
   - <<5, (6, 8, 26)>>
   - <<8, (9, 16, 21)>>
   - <<9, (6, 8, 19)>>
   - <<11, (1, 14, 22)>>
   - <<12, (1, 17, 29)>>
   - <<16, (3, 8, 26)>>
   - <<19, (9, 12, 29)>>
   - <<22, (11, 15, 24)>>
   - <<23, (2, 20, 25)>>
   - <<24, (14, 22, 27)>>
   - <<26, (5, 16, 4)>>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
