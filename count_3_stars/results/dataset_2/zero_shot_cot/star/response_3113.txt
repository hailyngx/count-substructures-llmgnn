Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in this graph:

<4, (8, 9, 5)>
<7, (11, 9, 2)>
<8, (4, 13, 14)>
<13, (8, 2, 1)>
<10, (11, 0, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 12)>
<6, (10, 5, 2)>
<0, (10, 11, 12)>
<14, (8, 13, 5)>
<2, (7, 13, 6)>
<12, (5, 0, 2)>
<3, (4, 10, 14)>
<9, (4, 7, 0)>
<1, (7, 8, 13)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: 
[14]
