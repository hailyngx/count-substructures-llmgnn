Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars first. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<7, (4, 1, 0)>
<1, (5, 7, 2)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 1)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
[9]
