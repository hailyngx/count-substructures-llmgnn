Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 2) (16, 0) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 4) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph with 20 nodes and 60 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

The nodes with three edges are: 10, 11, 5, 17, 0, 2, 12, 7, 19, 1, 4.

Now, let's identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<10, (12, 1, 14)>
<11, (19, 2, 0)>
<5, (13, 2, 1)>
<17, (5, 3, 4)>
<0, (11, 5, 16)>
<2, (10, 11, 5)>
<12, (10, 7, 9)>
<7, (8, 12, 3)>
<19, (8, 11, 18)>
<1, (10, 5, 9)>
<4, (17, 15, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
