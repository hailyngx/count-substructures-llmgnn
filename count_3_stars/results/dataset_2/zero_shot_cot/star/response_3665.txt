Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by finding all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all possible 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4: (3, 12, 13)
- Node 5: (10, 11, 1)
- Node 7: (11, 12, 0)
- Node 8: (12, 14, 7)
- Node 9: (10, 11, 13)

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
[5] 
<4, (3, 12, 13)> 
<5, (10, 11, 1)> 
<7, (11, 12, 0)> 
<8, (12, 14, 7)> 
<9, (10, 11, 13)>
