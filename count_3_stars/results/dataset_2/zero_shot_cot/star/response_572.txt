Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <6, (9, 5, 1)>
- <9, (6, 8, 0)>
- <1, (6, 2, 5)>
- <3, (7, 0, 5)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 2)>
- <8, (6, 9, 1)>
- <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- <0, (9, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 0)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found 10 of them. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
