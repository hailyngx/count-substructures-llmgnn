Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 12) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 13) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 13) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 7) (2, 11) (2, 4) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 18) (28, 6) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 26) (29, 18) (29, 23) (26, 22) (26, 17) (26, 13) (26, 5) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 26) (13, 19) (13, 27) (8, 21) (8, 12) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 24) (10, 15) (10, 21) (10, 9) (11, 2) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 4) (27, 25) (27, 13) (27, 5) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (5, 26) (5, 27) (7, 3) (7, 22) (7, 1) (19, 15) (19, 13) (14, 22) (14, 16) (14, 9) (24, 21) (24, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 14) (1, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 24) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations. We can start by examining each node in the graph and determining if it is the center of a 3-star. 

The node degrees are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 5
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 4
- Node 19: degree 2
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 4
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 3

There are 4 nodes with degree 3, which are good candidates to be the center of a 3-star: nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.

Let's count the number of 3-stars:
- For node 3: (3, 7, 12)
- For node 5: (5, 26, 27)
- For node 6: (6, 17, 28)
- For node 7: (7, 1, 22)

Therefore, there are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (7, 12)>
- <5, (26, 27)>
- <6, (17, 28)>
- <7, (1, 22)>
