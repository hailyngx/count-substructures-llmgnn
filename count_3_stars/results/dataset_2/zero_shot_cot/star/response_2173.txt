Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaf nodes. Since a 3-star has one central node and three leaf nodes connected to it, we can start by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors.

From the given edges, we can identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 5 (neighbors: 1, 3, 7)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 7, 8, 3)
- Node 0 (neighbors: 8, 3, 8)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
