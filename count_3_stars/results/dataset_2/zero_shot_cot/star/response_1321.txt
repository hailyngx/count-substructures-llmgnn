Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with degree 3 since those nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star. The nodes with degree 3 in this graph are: 5, 6, 2, 8, 0, 7, 9, and 1.

Now, let's check each of these nodes and determine the 3-stars they are part of:

1. Node 5: <5, (6, 8, 1)> 
2. Node 6: <6, (5, 3, 8)>
3. Node 2: <2, (5, 1, 7)>
4. Node 8: <8, (5, 6, 0)>
5. Node 0: <0, (8, 7, 3)>
6. Node 7: <7, (2, 1, 9)>
7. Node 9: <9, (7, 4, 1)>
8. Node 1: <1, (5, 2, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
