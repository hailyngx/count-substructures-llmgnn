Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 15) (19, 1) (19, 16) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 19) (9, 13) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them, making each of them a potential center for a 3-star. 

From the given edges, the nodes with exactly three edges are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, and 14. 

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. 

After identifying, we can see the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 12, 17)>
<1, (5, 12, 19)>
<2, (8, 12, 18)>
<3, (4, 11, 16)>
<4, (0, 3, 12)>
<5, (1, 6, 15)>
<9, (13, 16, 19)>
<10, (6, 17, 0)>
<11, (3, 7, 14)>
<14, (1, 6, 11)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
