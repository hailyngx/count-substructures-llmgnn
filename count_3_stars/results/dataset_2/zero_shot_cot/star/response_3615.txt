Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (11, 12) (11, 0) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 13)>
