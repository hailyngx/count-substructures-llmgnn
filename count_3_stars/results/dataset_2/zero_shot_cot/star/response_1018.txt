Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 25) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 8) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 4) (25, 1) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 24) (8, 3) (8, 9) (13, 25) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 23) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 29) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 7) (4, 20) (4, 10) (4, 29) (4, 17) (18, 25) (18, 21) (18, 29) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 16) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 28) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 23) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 2) (6, 7) (21, 18) (21, 23) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 28) (9, 11) (2, 19) (2, 5) (22, 19) (22, 29) (24, 3) (24, 25) (24, 19) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 21) (14, 12) (29, 0) (29, 4) (29, 18) (29, 22) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (17, 4) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 9) (16, 26) (16, 10) (27, 10) (10, 4) (10, 16) (10, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes with three edges connected to them.
- Node 3 has edges (3, 1), (3, 0), and (3, 24).
- Node 25 has edges (25, 1), (25, 20), and (25, 18).
- Node 13 has edges (13, 25), (13, 5), and (13, 11).
- Node 0 has edges (0, 3), (0, 15), and (0, 29).
- Node 20 has edges (20, 25), (20, 15), and (20, 4).
- Node 4 has edges (4, 20), (4, 10), and (4, 29).
- Node 18 has edges (18, 25), (18, 21), and (18, 29).
- Node 19 has edges (19, 26), (19, 22), and (19, 24).

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
- The total number of 3-stars is 8.

[8]

Unique 3-stars: 
<3, (1, 0, 24)>
<25, (1, 20, 18)>
<13, (25, 5, 11)>
<0, (3, 15, 29)>
<20, (25, 15, 4)>
<4, (20, 10, 29)>
<18, (25, 21, 29)>
<19, (26, 22, 24)>
