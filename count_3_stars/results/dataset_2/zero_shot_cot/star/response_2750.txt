Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 0) (18, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 19) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 2) (17, 6) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 4) (15, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 15) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (3, 11, 15)>
2. <1, (10, 11, 13)>
3. <2, (13, 17, 6)>
4. <4, (11, 14, 16)>
5. <5, (8, 19, 12)>
6. <7, (11, 14, 16)>
7. <9, (7, 12, 13)>
8. <10, (1, 13, 14)>
9. <11, (0, 3, 4)>
10. <12, (6, 9, 14)>
11. <13, (2, 9, 10)>
12. <14, (4, 7, 10)>
13. <16, (4, 7, 14)>
14. <17, (2, 6, 13)>
15. <18, (0, 3, 15)>
16. <19, (5, 8, 12)>

There are 16 unique 3-stars in total. So, the answer is [16].
