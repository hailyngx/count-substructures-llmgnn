Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Looking at node 5: <5, (2, 8, 1)>
2. Looking at node 6: <6, (9, 7, 3)>
3. Looking at node 1: <1, (5, 4, 3)>
4. Looking at node 3: <3, (6, 4, 2)>
5. Looking at node 2: <2, (5, 4, 6)>
6. Looking at node 8: <8, (5, 9, 6)>
7. Looking at node 7: <7, (6, 8, 0)>
8. Looking at node 4: <4, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, there are 8 3-stars in the given graph. [8]
