Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 12) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 3) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all the unique sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list all the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:

1. Node 2: (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12)
2. Node 3: (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 12)
3. Node 4: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3)
4. Node 7: (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 9)
5. Node 9: (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0)
6. Node 12: (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0)

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
<2, (5, 8, 12)>
<3, (5, 2, 12)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (8, 12, 9)>
<9, (11, 7, 0)>
<12, (2, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
