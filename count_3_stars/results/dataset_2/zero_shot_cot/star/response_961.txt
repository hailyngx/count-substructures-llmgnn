Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. Let's list them:

1. <5, (9, 12, 1)>
2. <9, (5, 2, 10)>
3. <4, (7, 3, 2)>
4. <7, (4, 12, 11)>
5. <6, (1, 2, 11)>
6. <8, (10, 5, 9)>
7. <12, (5, 7, 13)>
8. <0, (5, 3, 11)>
9. <1, (5, 6, 11)>
10. <10, (5, 9, 8)>
11. <11, (5, 7, 6)>
12. <3, (9, 4, 0)>
13. <14, (1, 3, 13)>
14. <2, (9, 4, 7)>

Let's count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique combinations: [14]
