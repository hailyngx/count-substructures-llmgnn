Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 4) (16, 15) (5, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (4, 16) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 16) (15, 10) (15, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (19, 1) (19, 10) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 15) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found:
<1, (12, 14, 17)>
<10, (1, 15, 19)>
<12, (1, 14, 15)>
<14, (13, 17, 18)>
