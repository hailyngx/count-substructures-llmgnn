Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, first let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 9, 2, 4)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 5, 8, 4)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 5, 9, 8)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 5, 3, 8)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 9, 6, 2)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 7, 0, 6)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 9, 4, 7)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 1, 3, 2)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 5, 4, 1)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 5, 9, 3, 6)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by finding all unique combinations where a node with degree 3 serves as the center and the three nodes it's connected to are the leaves. 

Based on the connections given, the 3-stars are:
- <5, (9, 2, 4)>
- <9, (5, 8, 4)>
- <4, (5, 9, 8)>
- <7, (5, 3, 8)>
- <1, (9, 6, 2)>
- <3, (7, 0, 6)>
- <8, (9, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 2)>
- <2, (5, 4, 1)> 
- <0, (5, 9, 3)>, <0, (5, 9, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
