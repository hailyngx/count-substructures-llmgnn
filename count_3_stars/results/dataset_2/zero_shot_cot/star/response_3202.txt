Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the central node and its neighbors for each potential 3-star.

The potential central nodes can be any of the 10 nodes in the graph. For each central node, we need to check if it has exactly 3 neighbors connected by edges.

1. For node 0:
   - Neighbors: 1, 4, 8
   - (0, 1, 2), (0, 4, 9), (0, 8, 7)

2. For node 1:
   - Neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7
   - (1, 0, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 9), (1, 7, 8)

3. For node 2:
   - Neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
   - (2, 0, 1), (2, 5, 7), (2, 6, 9), (2, 8, 5)

4. For node 3:
   - Neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 9
   - (3, 1, 2), (3, 6, 9), (3, 7, 1), (3, 9, 4)

5. For node 4:
   - Neighbors: 0, 9
   - (4, 0, 1), (4, 9, 6)

6. For node 5:
   - Neighbors: 2, 6, 7, 8
   - (5, 2, 0), (5, 6, 9), (5, 7, 8), (5, 8, 2)

7. For node 6:
   - Neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 9
   - (6, 2, 5), (6, 3, 9), (6, 5, 8), (6, 9, 3)

8. For node 7:
   - Neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 0
   - (7, 1, 3), (7, 3, 1), (7, 8, 5), (7, 0, 8)

9. For node 8:
   - Neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7
   - (8, 0, 7), (8, 2, 5), (8, 5, 2), (8, 7, 0)

10. For node 9:
   - Neighbors: 3, 4, 6
   - (9, 3, 6), (9, 4, 0), (9, 6, 3)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (8, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (7, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
