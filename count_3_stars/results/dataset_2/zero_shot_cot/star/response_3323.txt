Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 7) (16, 13) (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (10, 18) (10, 1) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (17, 2) (17, 1) (17, 3) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 13) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 14) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (i.e., form a 3-star).

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<9, (5, 6, 13)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 10, 17)>
<2, (12, 14, 15)>
<8, (0, 11, 18)>
<15, (0, 1, 13)>
<18, (1, 8, 14)>
<7, (6, 15, 16)>
<4, (11, 13, 19)>
<0, (8, 15, 19)>
<17, (1, 2, 3)>

Count: [11]
