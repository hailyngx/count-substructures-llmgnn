Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (15, 1) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 17) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph (with 20 nodes and 60 edges), we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

Observations:
1. A 3-star consists of the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Each edge contributes to at most one 3-star.

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 16) form a 3-star with node 5 as the center. <5, (9, 10, 16)>
2. (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) form a 3-star with node 9 as the center. <9, (5, 4, 2)>
3. (1, 3) (1, 15) form a 3-star with node 1 as the center. <1, (3, 15, 3)>
4. (3, 1) (3, 11) form a 3-star with node 3 as the center. <3, (1, 11, 1)>
5. (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 15) form a 3-star with node 2 as the center. <2, (9, 18, 15)>
6. (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 4) form a 3-star with node 18 as the center. <18, (3, 2, 4)>
7. (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 10) form a 3-star with node 4 as the center. <4, (9, 18, 10)>
8. (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) form a 3-star with node 0 as the center. <0, (3, 14, 11)>
9. (14, 0) (14, 13) form a 3-star with node 14 as the center. <14, (0, 13, 0)>
10. (11, 3) (11, 0) form a 3-star with node 11 as the center. <11, (3, 0, 3)>
11. (7, 6) (7, 13) form a 3-star with node 7 as the center. <7, (6, 13, 6)>
12. (15, 1) (15, 2) form a 3-star with node 15 as the center. <15, (1, 2, 1)>
13. (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 6) form a 3-star with node 8 as the center. <8, (19, 16, 6)>
14. (19, 3) (19, 8) (19, 10) form a 3-star with node 19 as the center. <19, (3, 8, 10)>
15. (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 17) form a 3-star with node 6 as the center. <6, (7, 8, 17)>
16. (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 6) form a 3-star with node 17 as the center. <17, (2, 19, 6)>
17. (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 17) form a 3-star with node 16 as the center. <16, (5, 8, 17)>
18. (12, 13) form a 3-star with node 12 as the center. <12, (13, 13, 13)>
19. (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) form a 3-star with node 13 as the center. <13, (9, 14, 7)>
20. (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 19) form a 3-star with node 10 as the center. <10, (5, 4, 19)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [20].
