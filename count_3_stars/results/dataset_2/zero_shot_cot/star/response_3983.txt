Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify nodes with 3 edges which is a characteristic of the center of a 3-star. Then, for each of these nodes, we check the neighboring nodes to see if they fulfill the definition of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges: 0, 2, 5, 8

For node 5:
- <5, (9, 6, 2)>
- Not a 3-star since not all branches are connected directly to the central node

For node 0:
- <0, (9, 1, 3)>
- Not a 3-star since not all branches are connected directly to the central node

For node 2:
- <2, (5, 6, 4)>
- Not a 3-star since not all branches are connected directly to the central node

For node 8:
- <8, (6, 7, 4)>
- Not a 3-star since not all branches are connected directly to the central node

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
