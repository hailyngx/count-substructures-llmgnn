Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 16) (1, 7) (1, 12) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 12) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 18) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star.
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (9, 13, 6)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<9, (8, 16, 3)>
<11, (10, 12, 17)>
<12, (10, 11, 15)>
<14, (5, 7, 18)>
<17, (11, 15, 19)>
<19, (4, 17, 6)>
<0, (4, 11, 2)>
<2, (8, 0, 18)>
(There are 10 unique 3-stars found in the graph, so the final answer is [10].)
