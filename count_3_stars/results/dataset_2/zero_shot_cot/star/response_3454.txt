Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 22) (21, 9) (21, 12) (21, 15) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 22) (27, 12) (27, 8) (28, 29) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 22) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 16) (20, 1) (20, 15) (20, 23) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 25) (18, 3) (7, 15) (7, 25) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 5) (25, 18) (25, 7) (25, 8) (9, 21) (9, 29) (9, 11) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 8) (0, 13) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 8) (5, 28) (5, 7) (5, 26) (5, 22) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 8) (2, 6) (23, 20) (23, 7) (23, 26) (6, 2) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 3) (24, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (10, 12) (10, 26) (10, 24) (3, 18) (3, 24) (3, 19) (19, 1) (19, 3) (22, 1) (22, 12) (22, 29) (22, 16) (22, 5) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 26) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (20, 19, 22)>
<21, (9, 12, 15)>
<12, (21, 27, 10)>
<27, (12, 8, 29)>
<28, (29, 5, 22)>
<29, (28, 9, 22)>
<15, (21, 20, 7)>
<20, (1, 15, 23)>
<18, (4, 25, 3)>
<7, (15, 25, 23)>
<25, (18, 7, 8)>
<9, (21, 29, 11)>
<13, (17, 11, 14)>
<17, (13, 8, 25)>
<0, (13, _)>
<16, (15, 22, 8)>
<5, (28, 7, 26)>
<26, (5, 23, 10)>
<23, (20, 7, 26)>
<6, (2, 24, _)>
<24, (6, 3, 10)>
<11, (9, 13, 14)>
<14, (7, 13, 11)>
<10, (12, 26, 24)>
<3, (18, 24, 19)>
<19, (1, 3, _)>
<22, (1, 12, 29)>
<8, (27, 25, 17, 16, 26)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
