Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes, as these could potentially be the centers of 3-stars. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 4, 7, 6, 9, 1, 3, and 2 have degree 3. 

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 2, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<6, (4, 9, 5)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 2)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us [7].
