Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 16) (9, 6) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (3, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (0, 13) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 15) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 18) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 4) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 2) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (18, 13) (18, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star). 

By looking at the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars. Let's list them below:
<5, (6, 10, 16)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<10, (5, 9, 13)>
<13, (10, 17, 2)>
<2, (6, 8, 19)>
<8, (2, 15, 12)>
<15, (16, 8, 19)>
<16, (5, 1, 15)>
<1, (11, 16, 7)>
<17, (13, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 17, 11)>
<11, (1, 7, 4)>
<4, (17, 2, 11)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
