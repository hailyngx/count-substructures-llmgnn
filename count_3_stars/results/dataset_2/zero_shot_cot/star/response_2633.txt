Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 0) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 29) (23, 20) (1, 26) (1, 19) (1, 27) (1, 18) (26, 1) (26, 10) (20, 23) (20, 18) (20, 5) (20, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 21) (13, 7) (5, 20) (5, 18) (11, 20) (16, 19) (16, 27) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 21) (12, 10) (12, 21) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 2) (17, 8) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 28) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 12) (27, 1) (27, 16) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 12) (21, 0) (0, 25) (0, 28) (0, 4) (0, 21) (24, 3) (24, 14) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 8) (14, 23) (14, 4) (14, 24) (18, 1) (18, 20) (18, 5) (18, 28) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (25, 2, 24)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<22, (23, 19, 29)>
<20, (5, 11, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
