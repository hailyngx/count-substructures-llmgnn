Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- 3-star with center node 5 and leaves (0, 12, 13) <5, (0, 12, 13)>
- 3-star with center node 9 and leaves (0, 2, 13) <9, (0, 2, 13)>
- 3-star with center node 10 and leaves (6, 7, 11) <10, (6, 7, 11)>
- 3-star with center node 11 and leaves (7, 13, 14) <11, (7, 13, 14)>
- 3-star with center node 11 and leaves (4, 7, 13) <11, (4, 7, 13)>
- 3-star with center node 2 and leaves (4, 6, 13) <2, (4, 6, 13)>
- 3-star with center node 8 and leaves (3, 6, 12) <8, (3, 6, 12)>
- 3-star with center node 13 and leaves (0, 2, 5) <13, (0, 2, 5)>
- 3-star with center node 7 and leaves (4, 6, 10) <7, (4, 6, 10)>
- 3-star with center node 4 and leaves (0, 1, 11) <4, (0, 1, 11)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
