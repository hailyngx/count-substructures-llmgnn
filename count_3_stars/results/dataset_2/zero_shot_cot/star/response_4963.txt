Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will be the center nodes of the 3-stars. 

The nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, let's find the neighboring nodes for each of these center nodes to identify the 3-stars.

For node 0:
- (0, 5), (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 8)

For node 1:
- (1, 4), (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 9)

For node 2:
- (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 6)

For node 4:
- (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3)

For node 6:
- (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 3), (6, 2)

For node 7:
- (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2)

For node 9:
- (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1)

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 8, 1)>
<1, (4, 0, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 3)>
<6, (5, 8, 2)>
<7, (4, 0, 2)>
<9, (5, 2, 1)>

So, there are [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
