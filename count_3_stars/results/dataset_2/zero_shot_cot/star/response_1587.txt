Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars.
- A 3-star is uniquely identified by its center node and the three leaves connected to the center node.
- We will go through each node in the graph and check if it forms a 3-star with its three neighboring nodes.

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (6, 7, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 5)>
<2, (6, 9, 4)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (6, 3, 5)>
<5, (6, 4, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [9]
