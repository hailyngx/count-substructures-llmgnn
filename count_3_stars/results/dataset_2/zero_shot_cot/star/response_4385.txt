Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 5, and 4: <6, (9, 5, 4)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 3: <9, (6, 1, 3)>
3. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, and 8: <1, (9, 3, 8)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 5: <3, (9, 1, 5)>
5. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 5: <4, (6, 7, 5)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 0, and 5: <7, (4, 0, 5)>
7. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 3, and 4: <5, (6, 3, 4)>
8. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 7, and 9: <0, (6, 7, 9)>
9. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
10. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 7: <8, (6, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
