Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 18) (4, 19) (18, 3) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 10) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 10) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 12) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 9) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 11: (11, 16, 17)
2. Node 16: (16, 11, 6)
3. Node 1: (1, 3, 7)
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 18)
5. Node 18: (18, 3, 5)
6. Node 5: (5, 18, 13)
7. Node 13: (13, 5, 12)
8. Node 0: (0, 7, 17)
9. Node 7: (7, 1, 10)
10. Node 19: (19, 4, 8)
11. Node 8: (8, 19, 15)
12. Node 9: (9, 11, 8)
13. Node 6: (6, 16, 0)
14. Node 2: (2, 3, 7)
15. Node 12: (12, 13, 2)
16. Node 14: (14, 5, 8)
17. Node 17: (17, 11, 0)
18. Node 10: (10, 7, 19)

Count of 3-stars: [18]
Unique 3-stars: <11, (16, 17, 6)>, <1, (3, 7, 18)>, <18, (3, 5, 18)>, <5, (18, 13, 5)>, <13, (5, 12, 13)>, <0, (7, 17, 0)>, <7, (1, 10, 7)>, <19, (4, 8, 19)>, <8, (19, 15, 8)>, <9, (11, 8, 9)>, <6, (16, 0, 6)>, <2, (3, 7, 2)>, <12, (13, 2, 12)>, <14, (5, 8, 14)>, <17, (11, 0, 17)>, <10, (7, 19, 10)>
