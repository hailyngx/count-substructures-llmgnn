Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 19) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 13) (21, 14) (4, 25) (7, 22) (18, 2) (18, 8) (22, 7) (22, 14) (22, 6) (8, 18) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 3) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 17) (26, 13) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (15, 9) (15, 20) (15, 25) (20, 15) (28, 29) (28, 12) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 12) (29, 24) (12, 28) (12, 29) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 0) (23, 27) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 23) (0, 17) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 15) (25, 6) (27, 23) (27, 3) (27, 5) (19, 11) (19, 3) (6, 16) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 17) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 6) (17, 3) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 27) (3, 19) (3, 17) (14, 1) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 5) (24, 29) (24, 5) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 14) (5, 24) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying all possible 3-stars in the given graph. 

The central node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a 3-star, so let's look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are:

- Node 0 (connected to 16, 8, 23)
- Node 1 (connected to 21, 14, 23)
- Node 3 (connected to 10, 2, 27)
- Node 5 (connected to 29, 27, 14)
- Node 6 (connected to 16, 22, 25)
- Node 9 (connected to 25, 15, 17)
- Node 13 (connected to 21, 8, 26)
- Node 19 (connected to 11, 3, 27)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

- <0, (16, 8, 23)>
- <1, (21, 14, 23)>
- <3, (10, 2, 27)>
- <5, (29, 27, 14)>
- <6, (16, 22, 25)>
- <9, (25, 15, 17)>
- <13, (21, 8, 26)>
- <19, (11, 3, 27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
