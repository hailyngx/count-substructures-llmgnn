Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 21) (9, 16) (9, 13) (26, 28) (26, 8) (26, 27) (4, 18) (4, 17) (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 5) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (25, 3) (25, 29) (21, 9) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 23) (2, 13) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 0) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 6) (17, 4) (17, 20) (17, 11) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 14) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 28) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 23) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (11, 17) (11, 19) (1, 2) (1, 13) (23, 2) (23, 19) (6, 29) (6, 22) (22, 6) (22, 27) (22, 8) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 16) (27, 8) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 12) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 14) (24, 12) (24, 13) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 24) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 27) (8, 16) (16, 9) (16, 27) (16, 8) (14, 20) (14, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are part of any 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we need to find all sets of four nodes where one of them is connected to the other three.

From the given edges, we can identify the following sets of 3-stars:
1. <9, (21, 16, 13)>
2. <26, (28, 8, 27)>
3. <4, (18, 17, 0)>
4. <7, (21, 29, 5)>
5. <3, (25, 21, 28)>
6. <25, (3, 29, 21)>
7. <18, (4, 2, 0)>
8. <28, (26, 3, 29)>
9. <29, (7, 25, 28)>
10. <17, (4, 20, 11)>
11. <20, (21, 17, 14)>
12. <15, (10, 19, 5)>
13. <19, (28, 15, 11)>
14. <0, (3, 18, 5)>
15. <11, (17, 19, 1)>
16. <1, (2, 13, 23)>
17. <2, (18, 1, 13)>
18. <14, (20, 12, 17)>
19. <10, (15, 5, 19)>
20. <22, (6, 27, 8)>
21. <12, (5, 24, 14)>
22. <24, (12, 13, 5)>
23. <6, (29, 22, 27)>
24. <16, (9, 27, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
