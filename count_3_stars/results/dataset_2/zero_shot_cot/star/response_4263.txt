Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 8, 6)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 8, 0)>
<8, (5, 6, 0)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 3, 0)>
<7, (9, 1, 2)>
<0, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. As we listed 10 unique 3-stars, the final answer is:

[10]
