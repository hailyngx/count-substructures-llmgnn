Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 6) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 8) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 19) (13, 17) (13, 7) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 11) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 10) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 12) (19, 2) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 12) (15, 0) (15, 16) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Find all nodes in the graph that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 2, 12, and 1.
- Node 1 has edges to nodes 5, 9, and 6.
- Node 6 has edges to nodes 17, 2, and 1.
- Node 4 has edges to nodes 9, 14, and 0.
- Node 12 has edges to nodes 5, 11, and 19.
- Node 19 has edges to nodes 2, 0, and 10.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
<5, (2, 12, 1)>
<1, (5, 9, 6)>
<6, (17, 2, 1)>
<4, (9, 14, 0)>
<12, (5, 11, 19)>
<19, (2, 0, 10)>

3. Count the unique 3-stars:
