Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
There are 3-star subgraphs in this graph. 

<4, (7, 9, 11)>
<7, (4, 9, 2)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>

[4]
