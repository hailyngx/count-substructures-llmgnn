Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 27) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 29) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 28) (0, 5) (14, 13) (14, 25) (26, 21) (26, 6) (26, 8) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 9) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 24) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 27) (13, 6) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 14) (25, 21) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 29) (8, 27) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 6) (22, 19) (22, 17) (22, 21) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 6) (29, 3) (29, 8) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 4) (17, 3) (17, 22) (17, 24) (16, 18) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 18) (18, 16) (18, 24) (18, 23) (18, 27) (23, 15) (23, 18) (23, 21) (23, 20) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 28) (20, 8) (20, 23) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 22) (21, 23) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 18) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 15) (6, 26) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find the central nodes and their adjacent nodes.

The central nodes are the ones that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the central nodes:
1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 28, 17, and 29.
2. Node 13 is connected to nodes 14, 5, and 27.
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 24.
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 28.
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 26, 20, and 29.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<3, (28, 17, 29)>
<13, (14, 5, 27)>
<5, (0, 2, 24)>
<9, (10, 11, 28)>
<8, (26, 20, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
