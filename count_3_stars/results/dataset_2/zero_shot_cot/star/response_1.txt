Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 12) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph, which consist of a central node and three other nodes connected directly to the central node.

Next, let's count how many 3-stars are present by examining each node in the graph and checking if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:

1. Node 0: <0, (9, 8, 7)>
2. Node 1: No 3-star
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 12, 10)>
4. Node 3: No 3-star
5. Node 4: <4, (5, 8, 3)>
6. Node 5: <5, (9, 12, 4)>
7. Node 6: No 3-star
8. Node 7: No 3-star
9. Node 8: No 3-star
10. Node 9: <9, (5, 10, 0)>
11. Node 10: No 3-star
12. Node 11: No 3-star
13. Node 12: <12, (5, 2, 10)>
14. Node 13: No 3-star
15. Node 14: No 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5] and they are:

<0, (9, 8, 7)>, * <2, (1, 12, 10)>, * <4, (5, 8, 3)>, * <5, (9, 12, 4)>, * <9, (5, 10, 0)>
