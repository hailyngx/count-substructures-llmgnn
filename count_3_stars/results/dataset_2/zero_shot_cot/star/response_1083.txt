Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify each node's degree by counting the number of edges incident to it:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 6
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 4

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 is a central node in one 3-star: <4, (8, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 is a central node in one 3-star: <5, (4, 2, 6)>
- Node 8 is a central node in one 3-star: <8, (4, 2, 9)>
- Node 9 is a central node in one 3-star: <9, (4, 8, 7)>

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [4].
