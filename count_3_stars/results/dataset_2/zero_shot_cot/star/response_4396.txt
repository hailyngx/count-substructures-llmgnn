Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 19) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 26) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 24) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 22) (4, 25) (4, 29) (1, 23) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 16) (26, 8) (26, 13) (26, 21) (26, 11) (7, 0) (7, 29) (12, 4) (12, 2) (21, 26) (21, 25) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 15) (5, 0) (13, 26) (13, 25) (13, 3) (17, 1) (17, 11) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (19, 9) (19, 28) (19, 10) (16, 23) (16, 1) (16, 0) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 12) (25, 4) (25, 21) (25, 13) (25, 27) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 14) (3, 28) (3, 13) (3, 24) (3, 20) (22, 4) (22, 11) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 10) (24, 23) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 10) (14, 8) (14, 27) (14, 24) (15, 28) (15, 0) (15, 11) (18, 27) (20, 6) (20, 3) (20, 10) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 22) (11, 15) (10, 19) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The central nodes of the 3-stars will be the nodes with three neighbors. Based on the given edges, we can identify the central nodes as follows:
- Node 4 has neighbors {8, 12, 22, 25, 29}, so it is a central node.
- Node 1 has neighbors {2, 16, 17, 23}, so it is a central node.
- Node 23 has neighbors {1, 2, 16, 24}, so it is a central node.
- Node 26 has neighbors {8, 11, 13, 21}, so it is a central node.
- Node 0 has neighbors {5, 7, 15, 16}, so it is a central node.
- Node 28 has neighbors {3, 15, 19}, so it is a central node.

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For central node 4:
    - <4, (8, 12, 22)>
    - <4, (8, 12, 25)>
    - <4, (8, 22, 25)>
    - <4, (12, 22, 25)>
    - <4, (8, 22, 29)>
    - <4, (8, 25, 29)>
    - <4, (22, 25, 29)>
  (Total: 7)

- For central node 1:
    - <1, (2, 16, 17)>
    - <1, (2, 16, 23)>
    - <1, (2, 17, 23)>
    - <1, (16, 17, 23)>
  (Total: 4)

- For central node 23:
    - <23, (1, 16, 24)>
    - <23, (1, 16, 2)>
    - <23, (1, 24, 2)>
    - <23, (16, 24, 2)>
  (Total: 4)

- For central node 26:
    - <26, (8, 13, 21)>
    - <26, (8, 11, 21)>
    - <26, (8, 11, 13)>
    - <26, (13, 11, 21)>
  (Total: 4)

- For central node 0:
    - <0, (5, 7, 15)>
    - <0, (5, 7, 16)>
    - <0, (5, 15, 16)>
    - <0, (7, 15, 16)>
  (Total: 4)

- For central node 28:
    - <28, (3, 15, 19)>
  (Total: 1)

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
