Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 8) (14, 7) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 11) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 16) (12, 4) (12, 5) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 16) (13, 18) (13, 15) (6, 16) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by examining each node to see how many 3-star configurations it is a part of. First, we notice that node 4 has 4 edges and node 7 has 4 edges. Both have more than 3 edges, so they can form 3-stars. Next, we check other nodes one by one:

- Node 4: <4, (7, 8, 10)>, <4, (7, 12, 15)>, <4, (8, 10, 12)>, <4, (8, 12, 15)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 8, 14)>, <7, (4, 9, 15)>, <7, (3, 9, 14)>, <7, (3, 9, 14)>
- Node 3: <3, (7, 9, 14)>, <3, (7, 9, 14)>, <3, (2, 9, 11)>, <3, (2, 9, 11)>
- Node 2: <2, (3, 8, 16)>, <2, (3, 8, 16)>, <2, (8, 16, 18)>, <2, (8, 16, 18)>
- Node 18: <18, (2, 5, 13)>, <18, (2, 5, 17)>, <18, (5, 13, 17)>, <18, (5, 13, 17)>
- Node 8: <8, (4, 5, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 0)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 0: <0, (8, 5, 16)>
- Node 14: <14, (7, 3, 9)>
- Node 17: <17, (18, 11, 16)>, <17, (18, 11, 5)>
- Node 15: <15, (4, 13, 1)>, <15, (4, 13, 2)>
- Node 9: <9, (7, 3, 16)>
- Node 12: <12, (4, 5, 15)>
- Node 11: <11, (1, 17, 19)>, <11, (2, 17, 5)>
- Node 19: <19, (11, 5, 16)>
- Node 5: <5, (18, 8, 11)>
- Node 16: <16, (2, 9, 10)>, <16, (6, 17, 16)>, <16, (6, 17, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
