Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star structure.
A 3-star structure consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-star structures:

1. <6, (9, 5, 3)>
2. <6, (5, 8, 3)>
3. <6, (3, 4, 2)>
4. <6, (4, 2, 8)>
5. <9, (2, 1, 7)>
6. <4, (7, 1, 3)>
7. <7, (9, 4, 0)>
8. <1, (9, 5, 0)>
9. <3, (6, 4, 2)>
10. <8, (6, 5, 0)>
11. <5, (6, 1, 8)>
12. <0, (7, 1, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
