Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.
The nodes with 3 neighbors are: **node 5** and **node 8**.

2. Next, let's find the neighbors of these nodes:
   - Node 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 8, 9
   - Node 8 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 7, 2

3. Since we are looking for 3-stars, we need to find sets of nodes connected in the pattern of a 3-star.
Let's list all possible 3-stars:
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <5, (0, 3, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (0, 4, 5)>
- <8, (0, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 2)>

There are a total of **8 3-stars** in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is **[8]**.
