Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming the structure of a 3-star.

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 2, 5)>
2. <1, (3, 6, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 6)>
4. <3, (1, 5, 6)>
5. <4, (7, 9, 7)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 3)>
7. <6, (1, 2, 3)>
8. <7, (4, 5, 8)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 2)>
10. <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 3-stars in the given graph.
