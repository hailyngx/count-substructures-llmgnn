Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 3) (2, 25) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 26) (18, 23) (18, 10) (18, 24) (18, 21) (22, 26) (22, 10) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 20) (27, 8) (1, 12) (1, 26) (1, 5) (26, 29) (26, 22) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 23) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 14) (16, 3) (16, 15) (28, 12) (28, 4) (28, 23) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 21) (3, 9) (21, 18) (21, 3) (21, 15) (8, 12) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 0) (23, 18) (23, 26) (23, 28) (6, 8) (7, 5) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 25) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 21) (9, 3) (9, 19) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 14) (10, 5) (20, 27) (20, 8) (20, 4) (0, 2) (0, 19) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 10) (4, 28) (4, 20) (4, 24) (24, 18) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 25) (25, 2) (25, 14) (25, 24) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are directly connected to node 2, as this could be a potential center of 3-stars:
- Node 29 is directly connected to node 2.
- Node 3 is directly connected to node 2.
- Node 25 is directly connected to node 2.
- Node 0 is directly connected to node 2.
  
Now, let's analyze each of these potential centers to see if they form any 3-stars:
1. Node 29:
- (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 26) are edges connected to node 29. However, there are no 3-stars with node 29 as the center, as it does not have exactly three edges.

2. Node 3:
- (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 21) are edges connected to node 3. There is one 3-star with node 3 as the center:
  <3, (2, 16, 21)>

3. Node 25:
- (25, 2) (25, 14) (25, 24) are edges connected to node 25. There is one 3-star with node 25 as the center:
  <25, (2, 14, 24)>

4. Node 0:
- (0, 2) (0, 19) are edges connected to node 0. There are no 3-stars with node 0 as the center, as it does not have exactly three edges.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2] - <3, (2, 16, 21)>, <25, (2, 14, 24)>.
