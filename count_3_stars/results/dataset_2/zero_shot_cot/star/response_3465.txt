Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 14) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 12) (15, 10) (15, 7) (19, 17) (19, 16) (19, 12) (13, 14) (17, 9) (17, 19) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 14) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 7) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (11, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph can be identified as follows:

<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<2, (3, 14, 16)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 12)>
<5, (3, 7, 15)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (7, 14, 16)>
<9, (0, 11, 17)>
<10, (1, 6, 15)>
<11, (0, 9, 17)>
<12, (4, 12, 18)>
<13, (14, 14, 14)>
<14, (13, 14, 14)>
<15, (7, 10, 15)>
<16, (2, 8, 16)>
<17, (9, 17, 19)>
<18, (12, 16, 18)>
<19, (12, 16, 18)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
