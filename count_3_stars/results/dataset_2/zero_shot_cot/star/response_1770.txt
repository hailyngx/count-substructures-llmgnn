Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in this graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to three leaf nodes. By examining the given edges, we can identify the following 3-star structures:

<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (7, 9, 8)>
<6, (4, 1)>
<9, (4, 7, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 1, 3, 2)>
<5, (7, 8, 0)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<0, (7, 1, 5, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[<4, (7, 1, 6)>, <7, (4, 0, 3)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (7, 9, 8)>, <6, (4, 1)>, <9, (4, 7, 1, 3)>, <8, (4, 1, 3, 2)>, <5, (7, 8, 0)>, <2, (7, 8, 0)>, <0, (7, 1, 5, 2)>]
