Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 6) (3, 25) (3, 4) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 5) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 17) (23, 11) (23, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (6, 13) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 12) (28, 8) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 1) (18, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 19) (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 5) (1, 0) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 16) (26, 14) (26, 21) (24, 27) (7, 14) (7, 27) (19, 18) (19, 12) (19, 2) (19, 0) (29, 25) (29, 12) (0, 28) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 17) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 15) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 17) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 1) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 20) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 15) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 21) (9, 10) (20, 27) (15, 2) (15, 21) (15, 16) 

Response:
First, count the number of nodes that are connected to node 13, 22, and 3, respectively:
- Node 13: 4 connected nodes (22, 16, 2, 6)
- Node 22: 2 connected nodes (13, 6)
- Node 3: 2 connected nodes (25, 4)

Next, identify the 3-stars centered at these nodes:
- 3-star centered at node 13: <13, (22, 16, 2)> and <13, (22, 6, 7)>
- 3-star centered at node 22: <22, (13, 6, 28)>
- 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (25, 4, 12)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: 4

Therefore, the answer is [4].
