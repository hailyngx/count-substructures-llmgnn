Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (0, 16) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 6) (13, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph and count each unique occurrence.

The nodes that form 3-stars are:
- For node 1: (1, 5), (1, 13), (1, 19), (1, 18)
- For node 3: (3, 15), (3, 7), (3, 14), (3, 9)
- For node 4: (4, 7), (4, 10), (4, 14)
- For node 5: (5, 11), (5, 10), (5, 14), (5, 1)
- For node 6: (6, 17), (6, 2), (6, 8), (6, 13)
- For node 8: (8, 10), (8, 6)
- For node 10: (10, 11), (10, 4), (10, 8), (10, 19), (10, 5)
- For node 11: (11, 10), (11, 5), (11, 17)
- For node 12: (12, 15), (12, 17), (12, 18)
- For node 14: (14, 16), (14, 3), (14, 4), (14, 5)
- For node 15: (15, 3), (15, 12)
- For node 16: (16, 0), (16, 2), (16, 14)
- For node 17: (17, 11), (17, 6), (17, 12), (17, 9)
- For node 18: (18, 1), (18, 12)
- For node 19: (19, 10), (19, 1)

Counting the unique occurrences, we find that there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 11, 14)>
<1, (13, 6, 19)>
<3, (15, 7, 14)>
<4, (7, 10, 14)>
<6, (17, 2, 8)>
<10, (11, 4, 8)>
<11, (10, 5, 17)>
<12, (15, 17, 18)>
<16, (0, 2, 14)>
