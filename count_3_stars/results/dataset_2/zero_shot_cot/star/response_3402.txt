Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's count the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 3)>
2. Node 9: <9, (6, 4, 2)>
3. Node 4: <4, (5, 9, 1)>
4. Node 7: <7, (0, 2, 1)>
5. Node 6: <6, (9, 2, 8)>
6. Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 3)>
7. Node 3: <3, (5, 1, 0)>
8. Node 0: <0, (7, 6, 1)>
9. Node 8: <8, (7, 6, 3)>
10. Node 2: <2, (5, 9, 7)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
