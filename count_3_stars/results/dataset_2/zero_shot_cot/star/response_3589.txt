Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 11) (12, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 16) (1, 5) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 15) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 15) (16, 1) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 17) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph, which could be potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 5, 8, 13, and 19
- Node 1 is connected to 5, 11, 14, and 16
- Node 2 is connected to 9, 11, and 14
- Node 4 is connected to 6, 10, 13, and 17
- Node 5 is connected to 0, 1, 15, and 19
- Node 7 is connected to 8, 11, and 15
- Node 9 is connected to 2, 3, and 10
- Node 10 is connected to 3, 4, and 9
- Node 11 is connected to 1, 2, 7, and 12
- Node 13 is connected to 0, 4, 6, 12, and 16
- Node 15 is connected to 5, 7, and 14
- Node 16 is connected to 1, 13, and 1
- Node 17 is connected to 4 and 8 
- Node 19 is connected to 0, 3, and 6

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Number of 3-stars: [2]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 8, 19)>
<13, (4, 6, 16)>
