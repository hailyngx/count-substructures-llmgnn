Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

1. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, the possibilities for central nodes are {0, 2, 5, 8} as these nodes have degree 3.

2. We can check the neighbors of these central nodes to see if they form 3-star structures. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
