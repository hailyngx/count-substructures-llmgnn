Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 14) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 11) (18, 3) (18, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 9) (19, 7) (19, 17) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 19) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 7) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 15) (0, 6) (0, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars present. 

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <11, (16, 5, 18)>
2. <16, (11, 1, 14)>
3. <3, (7, 14, 18)>
4. <15, (11, 0, 6)>
5. <18, (11, 3, 4)>
6. <14, (16, 3, 8)>
7. <2, (11, 9, 7)>
8. <0, (15, 6, 17)>
9. <1, (16, 5, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
