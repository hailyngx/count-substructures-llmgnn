Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 20) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 6) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 23) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 4) (6, 13) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 24) (12, 7) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 1) (28, 27) (28, 11) (28, 14) (17, 15) (20, 9) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 5) (5, 20) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 0) (19, 27) (19, 5) (19, 0) (25, 15) (25, 21) (1, 11) (1, 29) (29, 1) (29, 21) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 10) (13, 6) (13, 20) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 29) (14, 18) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 23) (22, 5) (22, 14) (22, 10) (22, 8) (24, 7) (24, 3) (24, 8) (8, 20) (8, 0) (8, 22) (8, 24) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 22) (16, 18) (16, 23) (16, 4) (4, 6) (4, 16) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 16) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <21, (26, 25, 29)>
2. <26, (21, 6, 3)>
3. <15, (27, 25, 17)>
4. <27, (15, 28, 19)>
5. <18, (2, 14, 16)>
6. <28, (27, 11, 14)>
7. <20, (9, 8, 13)>
8. <5, (20, 19, 22)>
9. <19, (27, 5, 0)>
10. <0, (5, 19, 3)>
11. <3, (26, 7, 0)>
12. <13, (6, 20, 13)>
13. <10, (18, 22, 3)>
14. <16, (18, 23, 4)>
15. <23, (27, 14, 16)>
16. <8, (20, 0, 22)>
17. <4, (6, 16, 4)>
18. <9, (6, 20, 9)>
19. <1, (11, 29, 1)>
20. <12, (7, 3, 24)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
