Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 1, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 8, and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 1, 6, and 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 6, and 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 0.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 8, and 2.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- There are no 3-stars centered at node 5.
- There are two 3-stars centered at node 9: <9, (5, 8, 4)> and <9, (5, 8, 4)>.
- There are no 3-stars centered at node 4.
- There are no 3-stars centered at node 7.
- There are three 3-stars centered at node 1: <1, (5, 3, 4)>, <1, (5, 3, 6)>, and <1, (5, 3, 6)>.
- There are no 3-stars centered at node 3.
- There are no 3-stars centered at node 6.
- There are three 3-stars centered at node 8: <8, (5, 9, 6)>, <8, (5, 9, 0)>, and <8, (5, 9, 0)>.
- There are no 3-stars centered at node 2.
- There are two 3-stars centered at node 0: <0, (3, 8, 2)> and <0, (3, 8, 2)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (5, 8, 4)>, <1, (5, 3, 4)>, <1, (5, 3, 6)>, <8, (5, 9, 6)>, and <0, (3, 8, 2)>.
