Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 19) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 17) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 7) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 10) (12, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 11) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (14, 9) (14, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we'll first identify the central nodes and leaf nodes of each potential 3-star. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (5, 15, 19)>
<4, (3, 13, 16)>
<5, (1, 13, 17)>
<7, (3, 15, 17)>
<9, (6, 13, 14)>
<11, (0, 12, 17)>
<12, (10, 11, 19)>
<13, (4, 5, 16)>
<15, (1, 7, 14)>
<17, (0, 7, 11)>
<18, (2, 4, 17)>
<19, (1, 8, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars we found: [12].
