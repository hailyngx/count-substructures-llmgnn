Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 15) (1, 20) (1, 27) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 15) (6, 22) (6, 18) (9, 5) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 29) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 4) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 23) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 3) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 28) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 15) (20, 26) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 29) (7, 2) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 18) (19, 24) (23, 0) (23, 25) (23, 19) (26, 20) (26, 29) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 29) (2, 13) (2, 27) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 24) (28, 15) (29, 5) (29, 25) (29, 26) (29, 18) (10, 12) (10, 22) (24, 19) (24, 12) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 10) 

Response:
First, we can identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) to form a 3-star. Let's list them:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 19, and 12.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 11, 16, and 21.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 0, and 22.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 1, 17, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 14, 0, and 27.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 3, 23, and 29.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 11, 21, and 23.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 5, 25, and 26.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 6, 13, and 29.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 13, 27, and 7.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 11, 10, and 24.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 16, 21, and 10.

Now, we can write down all the unique 3-stars found:
<11, (16, 19, 12)>
<15, (11, 16, 21)>
<16, (11, 0, 22)>
<20, (1, 17, 4)>
<3, (14, 0, 27)>
<25, (3, 23, 29)>
<19, (11, 21, 23)>
<29, (5, 25, 26)>
<18, (6, 13, 29)>
<2, (13, 27, 7)>
<12, (11, 10, 24)>
<22, (16, 21, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 12. 
So, the answer is [12].
