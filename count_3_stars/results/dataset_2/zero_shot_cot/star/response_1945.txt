Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars, which are structures where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's determine the total number of 3-stars. We can follow these steps:
1. Identify nodes with degree 3 as they can act as the center of a 3-star.
2. For each node with degree 3, count the number of unique 3-stars it can form.

Given graph and provided edges:
There are no nodes with degree 3 in the graph. Hence, there are no 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0] (there are no 3-stars).

<1, (2, 3, 4)>
Note: The graph described in the given edges does not contain any 3-stars; therefore, the final count is 0.
