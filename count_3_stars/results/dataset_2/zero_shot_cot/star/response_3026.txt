Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Given the information that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the edges provided.

Counting the occurrences of 3-stars with the provided edges:

- Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 8, and 0
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 4, and 7
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 11, 0, and 6
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 10, 1, and 8

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<10, (11, 0, 6)>
<11, (10, 1, 8)>
