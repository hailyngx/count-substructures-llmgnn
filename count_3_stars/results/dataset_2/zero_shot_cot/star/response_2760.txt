Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and the leaf nodes in the given graph.

Central nodes (degree = 3):
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 4
- Node 7
- Node 11
- Node 13
- Node 12
- Node 3

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Total count of 3-stars: [7]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 13, 12)>
<9, (5, 4, 11)>
<4, (9, 7, 12)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<11, (9, 3, 14)>
<13, (5, 12, 3)>
<12, (5, 4, 13)>
