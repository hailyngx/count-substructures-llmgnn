Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which could possibly be the center of a 3-star graph. Nodes connected to less or more than three nodes cannot be the center of a 3-star graph.

The nodes fitting the criteria are: 0, 1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 12, and 13.

Next, let's check each of these nodes for their connections to see if they form 3-star graphs.

For node 0:
- Connected to: 7, 13, 6
- Forms a 3-star <0, (7, 13, 6)>

For node 1:
- Connected to: 2, 9, 6
- Forms a 3-star <1, (2, 9, 6)>

For node 2:
- Connected to: 7, 8, 12
- Forms a 3-star <2, (7, 8, 12)>

For node 5:
- Connected to: 7, 13, 11
- Forms a 3-star <5, (7, 13, 11)>

For node 9:
- Connected to: 4, 8, 1
- Forms a 3-star <9, (4, 8, 1)>

For node 10:
- Connected to: 8, 3, 12
- Forms a 3-star <10, (8, 3, 12)>

For node 12:
- Connected to: 2, 13, 10
- Forms a 3-star <12, (2, 13, 10)>

For node 13:
- Connected to: 5, 14, 12
- Forms a 3-star <13, (5, 14, 12)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is: [8].
