Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (26, 8) (26, 27) (5, 9) (5, 18) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 16) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 18) (3, 13) (22, 2) (22, 15) (22, 8) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 13) (23, 12) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 28) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 21) (2, 1) (2, 22) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (28, 13) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 15) (14, 0) (14, 10) (14, 18) (14, 25) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 19) (7, 0) (7, 23) (7, 8) (7, 29) (7, 15) (6, 0) (6, 21) (6, 15) (21, 27) (21, 11) (21, 6) (21, 25) (12, 23) (12, 16) (16, 27) (16, 10) (16, 12) (24, 19) (24, 20) (4, 20) (15, 22) (15, 29) (15, 7) (15, 6) (20, 24) (20, 4) (20, 19) (19, 28) (19, 17) (19, 24) (19, 20) (25, 28) (25, 14) (25, 21) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the other nodes by exactly three edges. These nodes will be the potential central nodes of our 3-stars. We can then check each potential central node to see if it forms a 3-star with exactly three leaves.

Potential central nodes with degree 3: 0, 11, 12, 24, 4

For central node 0:
- Potential 3-star: <0, (6, 7, 14)>
- Potential 3-star: <0, (7, 27, 29)>
- Potential 3-star: <0, (14, 18, 25)>
- Potential 3-star: <0, (27, 21, 26)>

For central node 11:
- Potential 3-star: <11, (10, 21, 23)>

For central node 12:
- Potential 3-star: <12, (16, 23, 24)>

For central node 24:
- Potential 3-star: <24, (19, 20, 25)>

For central node 4:
- Potential 3-star: <4, (20, 24, 19)>

[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5.]
<0, (6, 7, 14)> <0, (7, 27, 29)> <0, (14, 18, 25)> <0, (27, 21, 26)> <11, (10, 21, 23)> <12, (16, 23, 24)> <24, (19, 20, 25)> <4, (20, 24, 19)>
