Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 13) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 9) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify the nodes with degree 3 since they can potentially be the center of 3-stars. We have the nodes: 4, 7, 10, 11, 5, 6, 12, 3, 13, and 1.

2. For each node with degree 3, check if it forms a 3-star.

   a. Node 4: <4, (12, 5, 14)>
   b. Node 7: <7, (12, 3, 10)>
   c. Node 10: <10, (7, 8, 1)>
   d. Node 3: <3, (7, 11, 8)> and <3, (13, 14, 9)>
   e. Node 5: <5, (4, 6, 13)>
   f. Node 6: <6, (11, 5, 13)>
   g. Node 12: <12, (4, 7, 13)>
   h. Node 13: <13, (5, 3, 14)>
   i. Node 1: <1, (10, 8, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars above, we get a total of 9 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
