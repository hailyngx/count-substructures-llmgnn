Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 13) (17, 5) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 15) (8, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 16) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 19) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 11) (18, 16) (3, 9) (11, 9) (11, 18) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 2) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 0) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

The central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, forming a 3-star.

Identify the 3-stars:
- Central node 5: (6, 8, 17)
- Central node 9: (4, 11, 3)
- Central node 4: (9, 8, 13)
- Central node 8: (5, 4, 15)
- Central node 6: (5, 1, 7)
- Central node 0: (13, 2, 10)
- Central node 1: (6, 15, 19)
- Central node 14: (19, 16, 18)
- Central node 12: (18, 19, 2)
- Central node 16: (14, 18, 2)

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and the count is [10]. 

<5, (6, 8, 17)> 
<9, (4, 11, 3)> 
<4, (9, 8, 13)>
<8, (5, 4, 15)> 
<6, (5, 1, 7)> 
<0, (13, 2, 10)> 
<1, (6, 15, 19)> 
<14, (19, 16, 18)> 
<12, (18, 19, 2)> 
<16, (14, 18, 2)>
