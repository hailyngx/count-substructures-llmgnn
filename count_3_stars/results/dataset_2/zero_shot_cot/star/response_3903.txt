Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 24) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 25) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 28) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (18, 15) (22, 4) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 21) (29, 9) (29, 6) (21, 17) (21, 28) (21, 25) (28, 7) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 13) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 24) (20, 17) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 27) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 28) (10, 19) (14, 20) (14, 8) (14, 2) (26, 2) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 11) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 19) (11, 7) (11, 27) (11, 0) (11, 23) (5, 24) (5, 23) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 12) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 28) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 14) (2, 26) (2, 16) (8, 14) (8, 9) (12, 23) (12, 19) (19, 10) (19, 24) (19, 0) (19, 12) (16, 20) (16, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that satisfy the conditions of being a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. For each node in the graph:
   - Look at its neighbors and check if it has exactly 3 neighbors connected by edges.
   - If it satisfies the conditions, note down the 3-star it forms.

2. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<1, (3, 4, 13)>
<3, (1, 15, 17)>
<4, (1, 13, 22)>
<6, (15, 24, 29)>
<7, (11, 25, 28)>
<9, (0, 8, 29)>
<10, (19, 0, 24)>
<11, (0, 7, 27)>
<12, (19, 23, 24)>
<15, (3, 6, 13)>
<16, (2, 14, 20)>
<19, (0, 12, 24)>
<20, (14, 16, 17)>
<21, (17, 25, 28)>
<23, (5, 11, 12)>
<24, (15, 19, 6)>
<25, (7, 21, 27)>
<26, (2, 16, 14)>
<28, (7, 21, 27)>
<29, (6, 9, 15)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 20.]
