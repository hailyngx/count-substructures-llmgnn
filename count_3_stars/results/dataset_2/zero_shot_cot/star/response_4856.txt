Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (14, 13) (14, 3) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This would constitute a 3-star structure with the chosen node as the center.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 13, 4)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (6, 11, 4)>
<3, (7, 12, 5)>
<4, (8, 12, 0)>
<5, (3, 7, 1)>
<6, (7, 9, 2)>
<7, (10, 11, 3)>
<8, (11, 4, 13)>
<9, (6, 0, 8)>
<10, (11, 7, 14)>
<11, (13, 8, 10)>
<12, (8, 4, 3)>
<13, (0, 9, 11)>
<14, (3, 10, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
