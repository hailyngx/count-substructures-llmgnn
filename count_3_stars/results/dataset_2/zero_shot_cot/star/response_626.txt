Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Find the unique 3-stars formed by each central node and the three connected nodes.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Central Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 3, and 4
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 1, and 7
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 6, 3, and 4
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7

2. Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (6, 3, 4)>
- <4, (9, 1, 7)>
- <5, (6, 3, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 7)>

3. Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, there are a total of [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
