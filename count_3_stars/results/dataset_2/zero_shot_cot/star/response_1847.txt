Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 10) (8, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 11) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (12, 11, 14)>
<9, (4, 10, 3)>
<4, (9, 13, 10)>
<8, (10, 3, 0)>
<7, (0, 6, 14)>
<12, (5, 9, 2)>
<3, (9, 8, 11)>
<11, (5, 12, 1)>
<0, (7, 3, 1)>
<2, (12, 0, 6)>
<14, (5, 7, 2)>
<1, (7, 11, 0)>
<6, (7, 2, 14)>
<10, (9, 4, 8)>
<13, (4, 7, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
