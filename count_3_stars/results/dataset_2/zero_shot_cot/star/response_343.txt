Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 13) (15, 4) (15, 28) (6, 18) (6, 11) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 0) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 14) (7, 13) (21, 25) (21, 22) (28, 15) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 24) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 19) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (17, 11) (22, 21) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 20) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 27) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 19) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 11) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 22) (19, 13) (19, 8) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 26) (14, 25) (25, 21) (25, 14) (25, 27) (27, 26) (27, 25) (4, 15) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 4) (12, 23) (0, 9) (0, 16) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 5) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 10) (23, 7) (23, 1) (23, 12) (23, 5) (20, 22) (20, 1) (24, 3) (24, 9) (24, 28) (24, 8) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its connected nodes.

Central nodes (with degree 3):
- Node 16
- Node 19
- Node 28

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node.

For central node 16:
Leaves: 1, 28, 0

For central node 19:
Leaves: 7, 29, 22, 13, 8

For central node 28:
Leaves: 15, 29, 16, 24

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<16, (1, 28, 0)>
<19, (7, 29, 22)>
<19, (7, 13, 22)>
<19, (7, 29, 13)>
<19, (7, 13, 8)>
<19, (29, 22, 13)>
<19, (29, 22, 8)>
<19, (29, 13, 8)>
<28, (15, 29, 16)>
<28, (15, 29, 24)>
<28, (15, 16, 24)>
<28, (29, 16, 24)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [12]
