Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 25) (26, 21) (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 26) (15, 3) (15, 16) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 24) (0, 8) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 4) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 21) (2, 0) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 11) (11, 23) (11, 2) (11, 28) (11, 14) (28, 9) (28, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 18) (21, 26) (21, 27) (21, 6) (21, 29) (21, 24) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 16) (29, 21) (29, 1) (29, 25) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 17) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 4) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 19) (1, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 22) (14, 7) (10, 5) (18, 6) (18, 1) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 17) (17, 22) (17, 7) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 29) (19, 12) (19, 4) (19, 1) (24, 23) (24, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list out all the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (8, 20, 2)>
<1, (6, 18, 29)>
<2, (0, 22, 13)>
<3, (15, 7, 14)>
<4, (27, 19, 16)>
<5, (10, 14, 29)>
<6, (1, 21, 13)>
<7, (3, 17, 14)>
<8, (0, 23, 20)>
<9, (26, 25, 28)>
<10, (5, 14, 29)>
<11, (23, 2, 28)>
<12, (16, 27, 19)>
<13, (22, 2, 6)>
<14, (5, 22, 7)>
<15, (3, 26, 16)>
<16, (15, 12, 4)>
<17, (7, 22, 17)>
<18, (1, 6, 29)>
<19, (12, 1, 4)>
<20, (0, 4, 8)>
<21, (6, 27, 24)>
<22, (2, 14, 17)>
<23, (8, 11, 24)>
<24, (23, 21, 27)>
<25, (9, 26, 29)>
<26, (9, 15, 25)>
<27, (12, 21, 4)>
<28, (9, 11, 26)>
<29, (5, 25, 18)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [29]
