Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 9) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 0) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 10) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 7) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 10) (4, 18) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 15) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 19) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 17) (8, 1) (8, 17) (10, 2) (10, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 8) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 5) 

Response:
There are two steps to solve this problem:

Step 1: Identify all nodes that are directly connected to node 11 since it will be the center of the 3-stars. Nodes directly connected to node 11 are 1, 14, 15, and 17.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars centered at node 11. To do this, we need to find nodes that are only connected to node 11 and count how many such nodes we have. Then we can calculate the number of unique 3-stars accordingly.

Let's find the nodes that are only connected to node 11:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 11.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 7 and 11.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9, and 11.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 11, and 19.

Therefore, nodes 2, 8, 7, 5, 6, 9, and 19 are only connected to node 11.

This means we have:
- One 3-star with center node 11 and leaves {2, 8, 7}.
- One 3-star with center node 11 and leaves {5, 6, 9}.
- One 3-star with center node 11 and leaves {11, 14, 17}.
- One 3-star with center node 11 and leaves {11, 15, 19}.

So, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<<11, (2, 8, 7)>, <11, (5, 6, 9)>, <11, (11, 14, 17)>, <11, (11, 15, 19)>>.
