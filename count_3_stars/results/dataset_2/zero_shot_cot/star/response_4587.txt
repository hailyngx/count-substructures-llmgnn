Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

First, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 2)>
<1, (4, 2, 5)>
<3, (7, 9, -)>
<5, (4, 2, -)>
<2, (9, 1, 5)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<0, (7, 6, 5)>
<6, (4, 0, -)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
[10]
