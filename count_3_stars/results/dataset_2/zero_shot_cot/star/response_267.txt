Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 26) (15, 25) (27, 18) (27, 2) (2, 27) (2, 9) (2, 4) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 24) (1, 6) (1, 0) (20, 11) (20, 10) (25, 15) (25, 21) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 6) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (17, 29) (17, 4) (17, 23) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 28) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 28) (18, 27) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 10) (9, 2) (9, 22) (9, 23) (9, 12) (22, 9) (28, 8) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 14) (28, 13) (13, 5) (13, 28) (13, 11) (11, 20) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 21) (12, 4) (12, 9) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 14) (21, 25) (21, 11) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 10) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 16) (24, 0) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 16) (14, 10) (0, 1) (0, 24) (23, 29) (23, 17) (23, 9) (10, 20) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) 

Response:
Let's look for the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. (4, 2, 9)
2. (4, 17, 23)
3. (4, 6, 8)
4. (18, 4, 19)
5. (11, 6, 21)
6. (14, 6, 16)
7. (16, 7, 24)
8. (19, 26, 28)
9. (23, 9, 29)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find 9 in total, so the answer is [9].
