Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes connected to a node with three edges, which will form a 3-star. Let's go through each node to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 6 has three edges connecting to nodes 9, 5, and 14: <6, (9, 5, 14)>.
2. Node 9 has three edges connecting to nodes 6, 11, and 14: <9, (6, 11, 14)>.
3. Node 1 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.
4. Node 3 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.
5. Node 8 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.
6. Node 13 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.
7. Node 4 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.
8. Node 7 has three edges connecting to nodes 6, 8, and 12: <7, (6, 8, 12)>.
9. Node 12 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.
10. Node 5 has three edges connecting to nodes 6, 4, and 2: <5, (6, 4, 2)>.
11. Node 0 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.
12. Node 14 has three edges connecting to nodes 6, 9, and 5: <14, (6, 9, 5)>.
13. Node 2 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.
14. Node 11 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.
15. Node 10 does not have three edges connected to any nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars are <6, (9, 5, 14)>, <7, (6, 8, 12)>, and <5, (6, 4, 2)>.
