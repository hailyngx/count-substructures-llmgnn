Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (26, 22) (26, 3) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 1) (22, 26) (22, 18) (22, 21) (10, 20) (17, 3) (17, 24) (29, 20) (29, 13) (29, 8) (29, 23) (0, 4) (0, 23) (14, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 2) (7, 16) (7, 23) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 29) (8, 7) (8, 25) (20, 10) (20, 29) (20, 27) (20, 28) (19, 15) (19, 6) (1, 18) (1, 6) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 24) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 21) (12, 15) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 27) (11, 6) (11, 13) (24, 17) (24, 2) (24, 3) (24, 5) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 28) (3, 26) (3, 17) (3, 24) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 23) (15, 28) (25, 4) (25, 8) (23, 29) (23, 0) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 28) (21, 22) (21, 12) (13, 29) (13, 16) (13, 11) (27, 20) (27, 16) (28, 20) (28, 5) (28, 15) (28, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph first.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 18, 23)>
<1, (6, 18, 19)>
<2, (4, 7, 24)>
<3, (17, 24, 26)>
<4, (0, 4, 16)>
<5, (2, 24, 28)>
<6, (1, 6, 19)>
<7, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (8, 25, 29)>
<10, (20, 27, 29)>
<11, (6, 11, 13)>
<12, (2, 12, 15)>
<13, (11, 13, 29)>
<14, (9, 14, 16)>
<15, (12, 15, 23)>
<16, (4, 12, 16)>
<17, (3, 17, 24)>
<18, (1, 18, 22)>
<19, (6, 15, 19)>
<20, (10, 20, 29)>
<21, (12, 21, 22)>
<22, (18, 21, 26)>
<23, (15, 23, 28)>
<24, (2, 3, 24)>
<25, (4, 8, 25)>
<26, (3, 22, 26)>
<27, (16, 20, 27)>
<28, (5, 15, 28)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars listed above to find the total number of 3-stars.
