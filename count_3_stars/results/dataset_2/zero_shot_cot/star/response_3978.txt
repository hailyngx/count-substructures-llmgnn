Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 10) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them: one as the central node and the other two as leaves. Let's start by identifying all such 3-stars:

<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<9, (5, 14, 10)>
<4, (8, 14, 11)>
<7, (5, 9, 2)>
<8, (4, 1, 10)>
<6, (5, 8, 10)>
<13, (5, 9, 3)>
<2, (4, 7, 12)>
<12, (9, 2, 14)>
<0, (3, 6, 11)>
<10, (9, 8, 6)>
<11, (4, 8, 2)>
<14, (9, 4, 12)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [13].
