Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to identify the 3-stars.
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.

Nodes with three edges connected:
- Node 4 has 5 edges connected (4, 7, 9, 0, 3)
- Node 1 has 5 edges connected (1, 7, 3, 0, 5)

There are no nodes with exactly three edges connected, indicating that there are no 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the count of 3-stars in this graph is [0].
