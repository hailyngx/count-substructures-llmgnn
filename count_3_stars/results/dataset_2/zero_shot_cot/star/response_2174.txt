Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 18) (12, 3) (12, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 17) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (16, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. <3, (2, 11, 12)>
2. <6, (8, 9, 14)>
3. <7, (11, 12, 15)>
4. <8, (6, 10, 13)>
5. <9, (0, 16, 17)>
6. <13, (2, 4, 8)>
7. <15, (7, 13, 18)>
8. <17, (1, 5, 18)>
9. <19, (0, 1, 5)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
