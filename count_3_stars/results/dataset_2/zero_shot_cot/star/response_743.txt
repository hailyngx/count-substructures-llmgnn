Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 6) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Nodes with 3 connections: 1, 2, 5, 8

Step 2: For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star.

For node 1:
- (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 8) form a 3-star <1, (2, 3, 8)>

For node 2:
- (2, 1), (2, 11), (2, 6) form a 3-star <2, (1, 6, 11)>

For node 5: This node is not part of any 3-star as it is not connected to 3 other nodes.

For node 8:
- (8, 1), (8, 9), (8, 5) form a 3-star <8, (1, 5, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
