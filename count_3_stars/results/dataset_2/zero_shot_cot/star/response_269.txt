Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 16) (27, 4) (27, 9) (27, 5) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 19) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 21) (23, 19) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 14) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 21) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 20) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 7) (22, 11) (0, 13) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 24) (1, 18) (6, 13) (6, 26) (9, 27) (9, 18) (9, 21) (9, 7) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 24) (24, 16) (24, 7) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 25) (19, 23) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 10) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 14) (20, 10) (21, 23) (21, 29) (21, 9) (21, 26) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 12) (5, 27) (5, 11) (5, 12) (12, 29) (12, 18) (12, 26) (12, 5) (14, 28) (14, 29) (14, 20) (10, 19) (10, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

For a 3-star, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. Let's list them:
1. Node 3: (3, 25), (3, 28), (3, 7)
2. Node 4: (4, 27), (4, 16), (4, 20)
3. Node 7: (7, 15), (7, 3), (7, 2)
4. Node 9: (9, 27), (9, 18), (9, 21)
5. Node 12: (12, 29), (12, 18), (12, 5)
6. Node 14: (14, 28), (14, 29), (14, 20)
7. Node 16: (16, 15), (16, 4), (16, 24)
8. Node 19: (19, 25), (19, 23), (19, 2)
9. Node 20: (20, 3), (20, 4), (20, 14)
10. Node 21: (21, 23), (21, 29), (21, 9)
11. Node 26: (26, 29), (26, 6), (26, 21)
12. Node 28: (28, 3), (28, 8), (28, 29)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

There are 12 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (25, 28, 7)>
<4, (27, 16, 20)>
<7, (15, 3, 2)>
<9, (27, 18, 21)>
<12, (29, 18, 5)>
<14, (28, 29, 20)>
<16, (15, 4, 24)>
<19, (25, 23, 2)>
<20, (3, 4, 14)>
<21, (23, 29, 9)>
<26, (29, 6, 21)>
<28, (3, 8, 29)>
