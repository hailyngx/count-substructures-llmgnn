Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<8, (4, 11, 0)>
<5, (1, 10, 14)>
<6, (7, 2, 12)>
<3, (11, 10, 13)>
<11, (8, 3, 14)>
<0, (4, 6, 1)>
<12, (6, 3, 14)>
<10, (4, 5, 3)>
<14, (5, 11, 12)>
<1, (5, 0, 2)>
<2, (7, 6, 1)>
<9, (4, 11, 10)>
<13, (6, 3, 1)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 
The total number of 3-stars is [15].
