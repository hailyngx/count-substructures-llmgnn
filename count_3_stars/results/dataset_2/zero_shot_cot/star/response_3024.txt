Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, as those can potentially form 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 neighbors: 4, 7, 2, 8, 0, 1, 9

Now, we can check each of these nodes to see if they are indeed part of a 3-star. 

For node 4:
- Possible 3-stars: 
    <4, (7, 6, 5)>
    <4, (7, 9, 2)>
- Total 3-stars for node 4: 2

For node 7:
- Possible 3-stars: 
    <7, (4, 9, 5)>
    <7, (4, 6, 2)>
- Total 3-stars for node 7: 2

For node 2:
- Possible 3-stars: 
    <2, (4, 8, 6)>
    <2, (4, 3, 6)>
- Total 3-stars for node 2: 2

For node 8:
- Possible 3-stars: 
    <8, (2, 9, 6)>
- Total 3-stars for node 8: 1

For node 0:
- No 3-stars can be formed with node 0.

For node 1:
- No 3-stars can be formed with node 1.

For node 9:
- Possible 3-stars: 
    <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- Total 3-stars for node 9: 1

Combining all the possible 3-stars, we have:

<4, (7, 6, 5)>
<4, (7, 9, 2)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 8, 6)>
<2, (4, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 9, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [8]
