Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 18) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 16) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 3) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 3) (2, 6) (2, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (3, 9) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 2) (8, 10) (8, 5) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 9) (16, 10) (16, 5) (16, 1) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 1) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.

Let's identify the nodes with three connections each:

- Node 1: (1, 12), (1, 16), (1, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 17), (3, 19), (3, 18)
- Node 4: (4, 17), (4, 11), (4, 1)
- Node 5: (5, 8), (5, 15), (5, 16)
- Node 6: (6, 14), (6, 17), (6, 0)
- Node 9: (9, 17), (9, 3), (9, 1)
- Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 7), (11, 4)
- Node 12: (12, 10), (12, 7), (12, 1)
- Node 16: (16, 10), (16, 5), (16, 1)
- Node 17: (17, 14), (17, 3), (17, 6)
- Node 18: (18, 7), (18, 19), (18, 3)
- Node 19: (19, 0), (19, 18), (19, 3)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (12, 16, 4)>
<3, (17, 19, 18)>
<4, (17, 11, 1)>
<5, (8, 15, 16)>
<6, (14, 17, 0)>
<9, (17, 3, 1)>
<11, (10, 7, 4)>
<12, (10, 7, 1)>
<16, (10, 5, 1)>
<17, (14, 3, 6)>
<18, (7, 19, 3)>
<19, (0, 18, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
