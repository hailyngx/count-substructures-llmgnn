Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as these are potential central nodes of 3-stars. From the given edges, the nodes with degree 3 are: 6, 9, 4, 8, and 12.

For each of these potential central nodes, let's check if they are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
1. For node 6:
	Node 6 is connected to: 9, 1, 7, 11, 12
	Node 6 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes: 9, 1, 7
	Therefore, <6, (9, 1, 7)> is a 3-star.

2. For node 9:
	Node 9 is connected to: 6, 2, 11, 3
	Node 9 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes: 6, 2, 11
	Therefore, <9, (6, 2, 11)> is a 3-star.

3. For node 4:
	Node 4 is connected to: 10, 8, 13, 5, 14
	Node 4 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

4. For node 8:
	Node 8 is connected to: 11, 4
	Node 8 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

5. For node 12:
	Node 12 is connected to: 6, 10, 11, 7, 13, 5
	Node 12 is not connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are: <6, (9, 1, 7)> and <9, (6, 2, 11)>.
There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
