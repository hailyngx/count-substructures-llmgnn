Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars present in the given graph:

<0, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 1)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>

There are 3 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [3].
