Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <0, (9, 14, 13)>
2. <1, (10, 8, 0)>
3. <2, (9, 10, 4)>
4. <3, (10, 4, 12)>
5. <4, (11, 3, 2)>
6. <5, (9, 6, 8)>
7. <6, (11, 5, 13)>
8. <7, (10, 3, 2)>
9. <8, (1, 10, 14)>
10. <9, (5, 2, 14)>
11. <10, (9, 1, 7)>
12. <11, (9, 6, 4)>
13. <12, (5, 4, 13)>
14. <13, (6, 0, 12)>
15. <14, (9, 4, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
