Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of ways we can choose a central node and then counting the number of ways to choose 3 leaves connected to that central node. 

First, let's identify the central node options:
- Node 0 has 3 adjacent nodes (1, 4, 9)
- Node 1 has 5 adjacent nodes (0, 2, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 2 has 3 adjacent nodes (1, 5, 6)
- Node 3 has 4 adjacent nodes (4, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 4 has 3 adjacent nodes (0, 3, 5)
- Node 5 has 4 adjacent nodes (2, 3, 4, 7)
- Node 6 has 3 adjacent nodes (1, 2, 8)
- Node 7 has 3 adjacent nodes (1, 3, 5)
- Node 8 has 3 adjacent nodes (6, 7, 9)
- Node 9 has 5 adjacent nodes (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- Central node 0: (0, 1, 4), (0, 1, 9), (0, 4, 5), (0, 4, 9) -> Total: 4
- Central node 1: (1, 0, 7), (1, 0, 8), (1, 2, 6), (1, 2, 7), (1, 6, 8) -> Total: 5
- Central node 2: (2, 1, 5), (2, 5, 6), (2, 5, 7) -> Total: 3
- Central node 3: (3, 4, 7), (3, 5, 7), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 8) -> Total: 4
- Central node 4: (4, 0, 5), (4, 0, 9), (4, 5, 3) -> Total: 3
- Central node 5: (5, 2, 7), (5, 3, 7), (5, 4, 7), (5, 3, 9) -> Total: 4
- Central node 6: (6, 1, 8), (6, 1, 2), (6, 1, 7) -> Total: 3
- Central node 7: (7, 1, 0), (7, 1, 3), (7, 1, 5) -> Total: 3
- Central node 8: (8, 1, 6), (8, 3, 4), (8, 3, 5) -> Total: 3
- Central node 9: (9, 0, 4), (9, 0, 1), (9, 3, 5), (9, 3, 4), (9, 2, 1) -> Total: 5

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (4, 3, 9)>
<6, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (1, 0, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 7)>
