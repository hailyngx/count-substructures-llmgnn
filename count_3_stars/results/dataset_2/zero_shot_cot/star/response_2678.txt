Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 12) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 15) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in the form of a 3-star pattern.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 11, and 8.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 2, and 17.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 17, 1, and 19.
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 9, 11, and 5.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 3, 13, and 18.
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 19, 14, and 2.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 1, 8, and 19.

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
<6, (9, 11, 8)>
<9, (6, 2, 17)>
<4, (17, 1, 19)>
<13, (9, 11, 5)>
<5, (3, 13, 18)>
<15, (19, 14, 2)>
<12, (1, 8, 19)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars identified:
