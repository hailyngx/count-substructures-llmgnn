Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are 15 nodes, and we are trying to find 3-stars which have a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

To determine the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<1, (3, 10, 11)>
<3, (1, 0, 14)>
<10, (1, 11, 8)> 
<11, (1, 10, 7)>
<8, (10, 2, 13)>
<13, (8, 5, 14)>
<4, (8, 0, 12)>
<5, (13, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (8, 11, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 12)>
<14, (3, 13, 0)>
<9, (10, 8, 0)>
<7, (11, 13, 5)>
<12, (10, 4, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
