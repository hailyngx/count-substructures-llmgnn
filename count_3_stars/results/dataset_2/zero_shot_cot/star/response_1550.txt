Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (15, 18) (15, 17) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 18) (19, 11) (19, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 17) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (18, 16) (18, 15) (18, 8) (18, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (17, 12) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 0) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central nodes and the connected nodes for each 3-star.

Let's go through the list of edges to find all the 3-stars:

1. Central node 0:
   - <0, (6, 9, 4)>
   - <0, (6, 9, 13)>

2. Central node 1:
   - <1, (3, 14, 13)>
   - <1, (3, 14, 9)>
   
3. Central node 2:
   - <2, (3, 5, 7)>
   
4. Central node 3:
   - <3, (1, 10, 13)>
   - <3, (1, 10, 2)>
   
5. Central node 4:
   - <4, (11, 16, 0)>
   - <4, (11, 16, 13)>

6. Central node 5:
   - <5, (3, 2, 17)>
   - <5, (3, 2, 18)>

7. Central node 6:
   - <6, (9, 10, 0)>
   - <6, (9, 10, 13)>
  
8. Central node 8:
   - <8, (17, 12, 18)>

9. Central node 9:
   - <9, (6, 14, 0)>
   - <9, (6, 14, 1)>

10. Central node 11:
    - <11, (19, 4, 0)>

11. Central node 12:
    - <12, (17, 8, 19)>

12. Central node 13:
    - <13, (6, 7, 0)>
    - <13, (6, 7, 14)>

13. Central node 14:
    - <14, (9, 1, 13)>
    - <14, (9, 1, 3)>

14. Central node 15:
    - <15, (18, 17, 16)>

15. Central node 16:
    - <16, (18, 11, 15)>
    - <16, (18, 11, 4)>

16. Central node 17:
    - <17, (15, 8, 5)>
    - <17, (15, 8, 12)>

17. Central node 18:
    - <18, (16, 15, 8)>
    - <18, (16, 15, 5)>

18. Central node 19:
    - <19, (11, 12, 8)>

There are a total of [18] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
