Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 2) (22, 26) (22, 6) (22, 1) (5, 9) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 0) (15, 27) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 21) (27, 7) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 1) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 28) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 24) (11, 10) (11, 6) (0, 9) (0, 20) (0, 21) (6, 22) (6, 11) (6, 28) (6, 3) (28, 25) (28, 6) (28, 1) (26, 22) (26, 29) (3, 6) (3, 24) (3, 16) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 19) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (19, 21) (19, 24) (1, 22) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 29) (1, 8) (29, 27) (29, 26) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 8) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 2) (23, 5) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 3) (24, 19) (18, 10) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 16) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 29) (8, 12) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 8) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (9, 20, 21)>
<1, (22, 1, 29)>
<2, (13, 17, 7)>
<3, (6, 16, 24)>
<4, (2, 8, 4)>
<5, (9, 23, 5)>
<6, (22, 11, 28)>
<7, (27, 29, 2)>
<8, (17, 1, 12)>
<9, (5, 14, 24)>
<10, (11, 18, 24)>
<11, (10, 6, 28)>
<12, (14, 17, 8)>
<13, (2, 16, 13)>
<14, (9, 12, 16)>
<15, (25, 27, 15)>
<16, (13, 3, 14)>
<17, (25, 2, 12)>
<18, (10, 24, 18)>
<19, (21, 24, 19)>
<20, (25, 0, 1)>
<21, (27, 0, 19)>
<22, (26, 1, 6)>
<23, (5, 9, 23)>
<24, (9, 3, 19)>
<25, (20, 17, 28)>
<26, (29, 22, 26)>
<27, (15, 21, 7)>
<28, (25, 6, 1)>
<29, (1, 8, 7)>

There are 30 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final count of 3-stars is [30].
