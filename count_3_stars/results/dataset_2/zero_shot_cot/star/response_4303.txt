Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 5) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 1) (4, 18) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 10) (5, 11) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 13) (16, 17) (16, 7) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 15) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 19) (1, 18) (1, 0) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 13) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 3) (3, 9) (3, 19) 

Response:
There are <0, (2, 6, 1)>, <2, (10, 12, 18)>, <4, (8, 18, 15)>, <5, (10, 11, 5)>, <7, (0, 15, 13)>, <9, (17, 3, 19)>, <10, (2, 5, 11)>, <12, (17, 2, 6)>, <13, (14, 7, 15)>, <14, (13, 19, 14)>, <15, (18, 7, 12)>, <16, (17, 7, 16)>, <17, (16, 9, 12)>, <18, (2, 4, 1)>, and <19, (14, 9, 13)>. 

So, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
