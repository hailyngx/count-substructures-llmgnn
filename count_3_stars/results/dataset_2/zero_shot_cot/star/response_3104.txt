Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 19) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (16, 8) (16, 12) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 19) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 12) (5, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph:

1. <2, (14, 11, 6)>
2. <3, (14, 17, 12)>
3. <4, (7, 15, 6)>
4. <6, (4, 7, 13)>
5. <11, (14, 1, 18)>
6. <13, (8, 1, 19)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
