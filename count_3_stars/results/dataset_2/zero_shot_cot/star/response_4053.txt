Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 since it must be the center node of the 3-star. The nodes connected to node 5 are 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9.

Now, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars.
- For node 1: (1, 5, 9) and (1, 5, 4) are 3-stars.
- For node 2: (2, 5, 9) and (2, 5, 4) are 3-stars.
- For node 4: (4, 5, 1) and (4, 5, 7) are 3-stars.
- For node 8: (8, 5, 3) and (8, 5, 0) are 3-stars.
- For node 9: (9, 5, 1) and (9, 5, 6) are 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (5, 1, 7)>
<8, (5, 3, 0)>
<9, (5, 1, 6)>
