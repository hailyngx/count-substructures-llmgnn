Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (13, 4) (13, 2) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 12) (0, 18) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 12) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 18) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

1. Node 17 forms two 3-stars with the following nodes: 
   <17, (14, 10, 7)>
   <17, (10, 14, 7)>

2. Node 10 forms two 3-stars with the following nodes: 
   <10, (17, 15, 6)>
   <10, (15, 17, 6)>

3. Node 15 forms two 3-stars with the following nodes:
   <15, (10, 4, 12)>
   <15, (4, 10, 12)>

4. Node 4 forms one 3-star with the following nodes:
   <4, (15, 9, 13)>

5. Node 18 forms two 3-stars with the following nodes:
   <18, (5, 0, 12)>
   <18, (0, 5, 12)>

6. Node 12 forms two 3-stars with the following nodes:
   <12, (5, 15, 16)>
   <12, (15, 5, 16)>

7. Node 9 forms one 3-star with the following nodes:
   <9, (4, 15, 2)>

8. Node 7 forms one 3-star with the following nodes:
   <7, (17, 10, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [12].
