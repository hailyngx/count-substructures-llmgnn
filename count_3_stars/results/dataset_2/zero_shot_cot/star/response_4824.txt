Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 24) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 20) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 2) (6, 20) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 28) (17, 8) (17, 21) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 21) (20, 5) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 27) (8, 17) (8, 27) (23, 10) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 19) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 29) (28, 6) (28, 17) (28, 18) (26, 16) (26, 27) (26, 4) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 14) (11, 1) (11, 4) (7, 25) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 7) (25, 21) (19, 23) (19, 16) (19, 12) (16, 13) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 19) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 24) (12, 19) (12, 2) (1, 23) (1, 11) (1, 24) (29, 14) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 25) (21, 15) (21, 4) (15, 21) (24, 22) (24, 5) (24, 2) (24, 1) (24, 27) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 26) (27, 24) (27, 18) (18, 28) (18, 27) (4, 26) (4, 11) (4, 21) 

Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Below are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (20, 21, 14)>
<1, (24, 23, 11)>
<2, (12, 24, 6)>
<3, (17, 14, 10)>
<4, (11, 21, 26)>
<5, (24, 20, 25)>
<6, (20, 2, 28)>
<7, (25, 5, 21)>
<8, (27, 18, 17)>
<9, (6, 28, 20)>
<13, (22, 16, 26)>
<15, (21, 25, 4)>
<16, (13, 22, 19)>
<18, (28, 27, 18)>
<19, (16, 12, 23)>
<29, (14, 0, 0)>

Finally, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and put it inside brackets.
