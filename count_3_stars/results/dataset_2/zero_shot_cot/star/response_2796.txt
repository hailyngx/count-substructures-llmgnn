Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. In this case, node 5, node 8, and node 1 are the central nodes as they have exactly 3 edges each.

Next, we need to find the neighboring nodes of each central node to determine the 3-stars. 

For node 5:
- Neighboring nodes: 6, 8, 1, 3, 7
Possible 3-stars:
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<5, (6, 3, 7)>

For node 8:
- Neighboring nodes: 5, 9, 0, 3
Possible 3-stars:
<8, (5, 9, 0)>

For node 1:
- Neighboring nodes: 5, 9, 4, 0
Possible 3-stars:
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (4, 0, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have:
