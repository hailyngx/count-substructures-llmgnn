Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph.

The central nodes in the 3-stars will be any node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it. 
From the given edges, the nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 2, 8, 4, 1, 5, 6, and 13.

Now, we need to find the leaves connected to each central node to form the 3-stars. Let's list them:
- Node 2: (10, 6), (10, 5), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 13), (6, 10)
- Node 8: (7, 8), (2, 8), (8, 5), (1, 8), (8, 2)
- Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 3), (4, 1), (12, 4)
- Node 1: (0, 1), (1, 4), (1, 14)
- Node 5: (11, 5), (10, 5), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 14)
- Node 6: (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 0), (13, 6)
- Node 13: (13, 7), (13, 2), (9, 13), (6, 13)

Now we can list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (10, 6, 13)>
<8, (7, 12, 3)>
<4, (12, 9, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 14)>
<5, (11, 8, 0)>
<6, (10, 2, 13)>
<13, (7, 9, 6)>

Finally, we count the number of 3-stars: [7].
