Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3 as they could potentially be the center of a 3-star.
Nodes with degree 3: 4, 9, 8, 5, 2, 3

Next, let's consider each of these nodes as the center of a potential 3-star and check if they indeed form a 3-star with exactly three neighbors.
For node 4:
- Neighbors with node 4: 9, 0, 3, 5
Since 4 is connected to 4 neighbors, it is not the center of a 3-star.

For node 9:
- Neighbors with node 9: 4, 2, 3, 1, 0
<9, (4, 2, 1)> forms a 3-star.

For node 8:
- Neighbors with node 8: 7, 5, 0, 3
<8, (7, 5, 3)> forms a 3-star.

For node 5:
- Neighbors with node 5: 4, 7, 8, 2
<5, (4, 7, 8)> forms a 3-star.

For node 2:
- Neighbors with node 2: 9, 5, 3, 0
<2, (9, 5, 3)> forms a 3-star.

For node 3:
- Neighbors with node 3: 4, 6, 9, 8, 2
Since 3 is connected to 5 neighbors, it is not the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<9, (4, 2, 1)>, <8, (7, 5, 3)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (9, 5, 3)>>.
