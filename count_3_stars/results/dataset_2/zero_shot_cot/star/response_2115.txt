Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 9) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 11) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 13) (16, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 5) (18, 16) (18, 14) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 6) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 19) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
