Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in each 3-star. 
Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we can consider each node in the graph and see if they are connected to exactly 3 nodes.

The potential center nodes are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 13, 2, 0, 1, 6, 10, 12, 11, 3, 14

Identifying the nodes with exactly 3 connections:
- Node 2 is connected to 4, 6, and 4 (degree = 3)
- Node 7 is connected to 0, 11, and 13 (degree = 3)
- Node 8 is connected to 13, 6, and 6 (degree = 3)
- Node 10 is connected to 9, 7, and 6 (degree = 3)

So, there are 4 potential 3-stars with central nodes 2, 7, 8, and 10. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (4, 6, 4)>, <7, (13, 11, 0)>, <8, (6, 13, 6)>, <10, (7, 9, 6)>.
