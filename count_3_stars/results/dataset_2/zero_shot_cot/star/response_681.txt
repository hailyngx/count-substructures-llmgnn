Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 28) (18, 4) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 8) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 14) (25, 8) (25, 15) (25, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 24) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 24) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 15) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 29) (1, 26) (26, 29) (26, 1) (26, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 19) (17, 12) (17, 21) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 27) (11, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 24) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (13, 28) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 21) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 5) (21, 13) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 5) (8, 18) (8, 22) (8, 25) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
First, identify nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars. 
The nodes from the given graph that fit this criterion are: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 20, 3, and 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 0, and 19
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 12, and 21
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 18, 22, and 25
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 28, 14, and 12
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 22, 26, and 23
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 20, 25, and 17
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 3, 0, and 16
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 7, 18, and 3
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 1, 26, and 15

Then, count the number of unique 3-stars formed by the identified centers: 
- There are <0, (20, 3, 2)>
- There are <2, (9, 0, 19)>
- There are <5, (6, 12, 21)>
- There are <8, (18, 22, 25)>
- There are <13, (28, 14, 12)>
- There are <16, (22, 26, 23)>
- There are <21, (20, 25, 17)>
- There are <24, (3, 0, 16)>
- There are <28, (7, 18, 3)>
- There are <29, (1, 26, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
