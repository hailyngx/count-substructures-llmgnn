Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three, forming a star shape. We will go through each node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Checking each node:  
- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes.  
- Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes.  
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes: (2, 3, 8).  
- Node 3 is connected to 2 other nodes.  
- Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes.  
- Node 5 is connected to 5 other nodes.  
- Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes.  
- Node 7 is connected to 5 other nodes.  
- Node 8 is connected to 6 other nodes.  
- Node 9 is connected to 4 other nodes.  

Identified 3-stars:  
<2, (3, 8, 6)>  
<2, (3, 8, 0)>  
<2, (6, 8, 3)>  
<2, (6, 8, 0)>   
<3, (2, 8, 6)>  
<3, (2, 8, 0)>  
<8, (2, 3, 6)>  
<8, (2, 3, 0)>  
<8, (6, 2, 3)>  
<8, (6, 2, 0)>  
<8, (3, 2, 6)>  
<8, (3, 2, 0)>  

Total number of 3-stars: [12]  
Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <2, (3, 8, 0)>, <8, (2, 3, 6)>
