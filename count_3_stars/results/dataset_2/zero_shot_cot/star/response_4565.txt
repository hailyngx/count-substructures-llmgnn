Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 15) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 10) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 17) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 19) (4, 17) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 14) (18, 16) (18, 11) (19, 3) (19, 10) (14, 13) (14, 16) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 11) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 2) (11, 18) (11, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern <center_node, (leaf_1, leaf_2, leaf_3)>.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. From node 1: (1, 2, 13) and (1, 3, 15)
2. From node 3: (3, 1, 13) and (3, 8, 19)
3. From node 5: (5, 6, 12) and (5, 10, 13)
4. From node 6: (6, 0, 8)
5. From node 13: (13, 0, 5) and (13, 1, 14)
6. From node 15: (15, 1, 12) and (15, 10, 0)
7. From node 17: (17, 0, 8) and (17, 2, 4)
8. From node 16: (16, 2, 14) and (16, 18, 11)
9. From node 18: (18, 11, 16)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
