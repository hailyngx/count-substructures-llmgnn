Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 14) (5, 9) (5, 16) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 2) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 1) (23, 13) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 24) (20, 2) (20, 11) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 7) (18, 27) (18, 26) (18, 12) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 17) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 3) (4, 10) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 21) (12, 18) (12, 6) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 19) (28, 3) (28, 14) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 11) (25, 9) (25, 4) (25, 17) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 14) (15, 19) (19, 3) (19, 15) (7, 2) (7, 10) (29, 0) (29, 4) (1, 27) (1, 24) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 21) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 16) (21, 4) (21, 11) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (24, 23) (24, 1) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Counting them, we have:
- Node 3: (3, 8), (3, 6), (3, 19)
- Node 4: (4, 10), (4, 25), (4, 21)
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 16), (5, 10)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 25)
- Node 11: (11, 20), (11, 17), (11, 21)
- Node 13: (13, 22), (13, 23), (13, 6)
- Node 16: (16, 5), (16, 17), (16, 14)
- Node 17: (17, 11), (17, 25), (17, 16)
- Node 18: (18, 27), (18, 26), (18, 12)
- Node 20: (20, 2), (20, 11), (20, 7)
- Node 22: (22, 13), (22, 23), (22, 26)
- Node 26: (26, 22), (26, 23), (26, 18)
- Node 27: (27, 0), (27, 18), (27, 1)
- Node 28: (28, 3), (28, 14), (28, 8)

Therefore, we have 14 unique 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [14].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<3, (8, 6, 19)>
<4, (10, 25, 21)>
<5, (9, 16, 10)>
<9, (5, 8, 25)>
<11, (20, 17, 21)>
<13, (22, 23, 6)>
<16, (5, 17, 14)>
<17, (11, 25, 16)>
<18, (27, 26, 12)>
<20, (2, 11, 7)>
<22, (13, 23, 26)>
<26, (22, 23, 18)>
<27, (0, 18, 1)>
<28, (3, 14, 8)>
