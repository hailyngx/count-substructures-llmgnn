Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 2) (1, 11) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 0) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars.

Finding the nodes with exactly 3 connections:
- Node 2 has 5 connections
- Node 6 has 4 connections
- Node 12 has 4 connections
- Node 13 has 5 connections
- Node 15 has 4 connections
- Node 17 has 5 connections
- Node 18 has 4 connections

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (3, 6, 12)>
<0, (3, 6, 15)>
<0, (3, 17, 19)>
<2, (6, 7, 13)>
<2, (6, 13, 15)>
<2, (7, 13, 15)>
<2, (13, 15, 17)>
<6, (2, 12, 13)>
<6, (2, 13, 15)>
<6, (12, 0, 3)>
<6, (12, 0, 5)>
<6, (12, 0, 10)>
<6, (13, 2, 18)>
<6, (13, 2, 7)>
<6, (13, 2, 15)>
<15, (0, 3, 17)>
<15, (0, 3, 19)>
<15, (2, 6, 13)>
<15, (17, 15, 18)>
<17, (3, 15, 19)>
<17, (13, 17, 18)>
<18, (11, 17, 19)>
<19, (0, 15, 17)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: [23].
