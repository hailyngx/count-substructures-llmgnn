Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 0) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 16) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (13, 5) (13, 17) (15, 1) (15, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 19) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 17) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 14) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars first. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the unique 3-stars first:

<1, (12, 11, 15)>
<2, (0, 7, 16)>
<3, (19, 16, 10)>
<4, (15, 14, 18)>
<5, (13, 17, 8)>
<6, (8, 9, 6)>
<7, (2, 0, 16)>
<8, (5, 17, 13)>
<9, (6, 8, 19)>
<10, (12, 10, 11)>
<11, (0, 14, 11)>
<12, (1, 10, 9)>
<13, (5, 17, 13)>
<14, (11, 4, 10)>
<15, (11, 4, 15)>
<16, (19, 2, 3)>
<17, (13, 5, 17)>
<18, (4, 14, 16)>
<19, (14, 9, 19)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars from the list above: [19]
