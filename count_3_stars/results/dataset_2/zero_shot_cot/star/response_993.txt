Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 10) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 16) (12, 5) (4, 15) (4, 18) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (17, 7) (17, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 19) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 0) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can see the following 3-stars:
- <3, (15, 11, 8)>
- <10, (11, 6, 8)>
- <7, (18, 5, 13)>
- <12, (16, 5, 0)>
- <4, (15, 18, 0)>
- <17, (7, 6, 0)>
- <19, (8, 16, 0)>
- <2, (13, 1, 5)>
- <14, (18, 8, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are 9 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
