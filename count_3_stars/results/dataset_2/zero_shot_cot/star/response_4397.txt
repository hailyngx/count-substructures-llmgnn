Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 1) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 9) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 18) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (8, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes could be potential centers of 3-star graphs. 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 16, 4, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 14, 1, and 15.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 14, and 18.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 17, 1, and 9.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 5.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 10.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 2.

Now, let's count the number of 3-star graphs in this graph.
- There are 3 occurrences of <4, 7, 10> 3-star graphs.
- There are 3 occurrences of <7, 16, 12> 3-star graphs.
- There are 3 occurrences of <9, 14, 15> 3-star graphs.
- There are 3 occurrences of <13, 7, 18> 3-star graphs.
- There are 3 occurrences of <15, 17, 1> 3-star graphs.
- There are 3 occurrences of <16, 7, 3> 3-star graphs.
- There are 3 occurrences of <18, 11, 12> 3-star graphs.
- There are 3 occurrences of <19, 7, 1> 3-star graphs.

Finally, let's sum up the total number of 3-star graphs: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 24
Therefore, the final answer is [24].
