Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 3) (26, 0) (3, 26) (3, 24) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 29) (15, 21) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 21) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 28) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (21, 15) (21, 6) (21, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 28) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 27) (28, 10) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 25) (13, 17) (13, 23) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 20) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 22) (0, 26) (0, 25) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 22) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 20) (23, 9) (23, 13) (23, 18) (7, 11) (7, 18) (24, 3) (24, 8) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 7) (12, 29) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 2) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 29) (29, 15) (29, 12) (29, 4) (27, 16) (5, 17) (22, 16) (22, 25) (22, 11) (2, 17) (2, 20) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to node 9 and determine if any of them form a 3-star configuration.

- Node 6, 8, 19 are connected to node 9. 
  - <9, (6, 15, 21)>
  - <9, (8, 19, 11)>

Next, letâ€™s consider node 26 and check if any 3-star configurations exist with its connected nodes.

- Node 3, 0 are connected to node 26.
  - <26, (3, 24, 18)>
  - <26, (0, 25, 22)>

Moving on to node 3 and check its connected nodes.

- Node 26, 24, 18 are connected to node 3.
  - <3, (26, 9, 6)>
  - <3, (24, 8, 19)>
  - <3, (18, 7, 23)>

Continuing in this way for all the nodes, we get the following 3-star configurations:

- <9, (6, 15, 21)>
- <9, (8, 19, 11)>
- <26, (3, 24, 18)>
- <26, (0, 25, 22)>
- <3, (26, 9, 6)>
- <3, (24, 8, 19)>
- <3, (18, 7, 23)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
