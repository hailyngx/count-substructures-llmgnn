Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, any node with exactly three incident edges can be a potential center for a 3-star.
Here is the list of potential center nodes:
- Node 0 (edges: 10, 4, 7)
- Node 1 (edges: 9, 8, 14)
- Node 2 (edges: 9, 14, 3)
- Node 3 (edges: 12, 0, 13)
- Node 4 (edges: 9, 10, 8)
- Node 6 (edges: 12, 14, 13)
- Node 7 (edges: 5, 0, NA)
- Node 8 (edges: 5, 9, 10)
- Node 9 (edges: 5, 8, 4)
- Node 10 (edges: 11, 0, 8)
- Node 12 (edges: 14, 6, 3)
- Node 13 (edges: 9, 10, 3)
- Node 14 (edges: 4, 12, 0)

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0, <0, (10, 4, 7)>
- For Node 1, <1, (9, 8, 14)>
- For Node 2, <2, (9, 14, 3)>
- For Node 3, <3, (12, 0, 13)>
- For Node 4, <4, (9, 10, 8)>
- For Node 6, <6, (12, 14, 13)>
- For Node 8, <8, (5, 9, 10)>
- For Node 9, <9, (5, 8, 4)>
- For Node 10, <10, (11, 0, 8)>
- For Node 12, <12, (14, 6, 3)>
- For Node 13, <13, (9, 10, 3)>
- For Node 14, <14, (4, 12, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
