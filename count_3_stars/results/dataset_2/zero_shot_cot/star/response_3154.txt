Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 0, 1)>
<3, (9, 0, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 0)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
