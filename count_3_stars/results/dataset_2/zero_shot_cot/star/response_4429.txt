Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's focus on finding the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

The 3-star graphs can be identified based on the number of edges they contain. A 3-star graph will have the following characteristics:
- A central node with degree 3.
- Connected to three leaf nodes with degree 1 each.

Let's go through the nodes and see which ones form 3-star graphs:

1. Node 0:
 - Connected to 6, 7, 11, and 12.

2. Node 1:
 - Connected to 4, 10, 11, and 12.
 
3. Node 2:
 - Connected to 3, 4, 9, and 10. 

4. Node 3:
 - Connected to 2, 5, 6, and 14.

5. Node 4:
 - Connected to 1, 2, 7, 8, and 14.

6. Node 5:
 - Connected to 3, 8, and 9.
 
7. Node 7:
 - Connected to 0, 4, 9, and 13.
 
8. Node 8:
 - Connected to 4, 5, 12, and 13.

9. Node 9:
 - Connected to 2, 5, 6, and 13.
 
10. Node 10:
 - Connected to 1, 2, and 14.
 
11. Node 11:
 - Connected to 0, 1, 6, and 12.
 
12. Node 12:
 - Connected to 0, 1, 8, and 11.
 
13. Node 14:
 - Connected to 3, 4, and 10.
 
Based on the connections, we have the following 3-stars:
<0, (11, 12, 0)>, <1, (10, 11, 1)>, <2, (3, 4, 2)>, <3, (5, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 8, 4)>, <5, (9, 5, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6, which can be represented as [6].
