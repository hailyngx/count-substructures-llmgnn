Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (9, 7, 13)>
2. <1, (6, 2, 11)>
3. <2, (6, 5, 14)>
4. <3, (4, 8, 14)>
5. <4, (6, 8, 12)>
6. <5, (6, 13, 2)>
7. <6, (9, 5, 1)>
8. <7, (9, 4, 13)>
9. <8, (9, 4, 3)>
10. <10, (12, 0, 14)>
11. <11, (1, 4, 14)>
12. <12, (9, 4, 10)>
13. <13, (9, 7, 5)>
14. <14, (6, 10, 3)>

Therefore, there are total [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
