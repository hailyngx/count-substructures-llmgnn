Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 5: <5, (6, 2, 4)>
- Node 4: <4, (5, 7, 0)>
- Node 7: <7, (5, 9, 4)>
- Node 1: <1, (4, 7, 0)>
- Node 3: <3, (9, 6, 0)>
- Node 8: <8, (4, 7, 0)>
- Node 6: <6, (5, 1, 3)>
- Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 0)>
- Node 0: <0, (9, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we have a total of [9] 3-stars.
