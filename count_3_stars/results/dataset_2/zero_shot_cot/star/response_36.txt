Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The center node must have degree 3 in a 3-star graph. Let's identify nodes with degree 3:
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 0 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 6

Thus, we can see that only nodes 0 and 6 have degree 3. Let's find the 3-stars:

1. <0, (2, 3, 6)>
2. <6, (0, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
