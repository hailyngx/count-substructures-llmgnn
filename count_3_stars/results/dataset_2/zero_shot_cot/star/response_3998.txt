Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 0) (22, 4) (22, 17) (22, 25) (2, 18) (2, 28) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 20) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 28) (8, 25) (8, 1) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 16) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 29) (12, 2) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 27) (7, 3) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 14) (16, 15) (17, 22) (17, 5) (17, 25) (17, 28) (25, 22) (25, 8) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 26) (23, 26) (23, 1) (26, 25) (26, 23) (26, 0) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 29) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 11) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 3) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 15) (15, 16) (15, 14) (21, 5) (21, 24) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 27) (28, 2) (28, 5) (28, 17) (28, 27) (20, 18) (24, 19) (24, 21) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential centers for 3-stars:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 17, and 21.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 14, and 15.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 22, 5, and 25.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 22, 17, and 26.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 27.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 11.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these potential center nodes:

- For node 5: 3-stars <5, (13, 17, 21)>.
- For node 16: 3-stars <16, (7, 14, 15)>.
- For node 17: 3-stars <17, (22, 5, 25)>.
- For node 25: 3-stars <25, (22, 17, 26)>.
- For node 28: 3-stars <28, (2, 5, 27)>.
- For node 29: 3-stars <29, (4, 1, 11)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
