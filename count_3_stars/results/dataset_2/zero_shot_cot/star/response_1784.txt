Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 16) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 21) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 12) (29, 17) (29, 19) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 22) (11, 3) (11, 22) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 2) (18, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 20) (13, 0) (13, 16) (28, 26) (28, 24) (28, 5) (16, 27) (16, 13) (16, 21) (21, 0) (21, 16) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 24) (2, 11) (2, 20) (2, 7) (22, 3) (22, 11) (22, 5) (19, 29) (19, 18) (19, 20) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 20) (7, 8) (7, 2) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 25) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 19) (20, 12) (20, 6) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 25) (9, 11) (6, 20) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 22) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with degree 3, as they represent potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
The nodes with degree 3 are 1, 4, 11, 12, 16, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: (1, 4, 17), (1, 4, 14), (1, 4, 10)
- Node 4: <4, (1, 14, 12)>
- Node 11: (11, 3, 22), (11, 3, 18), (11, 3, 9)
- Node 12: <12, (4, 1, 17)>
- Node 16: <16, (27, 21, 13)>
- Node 20: <20, (26, 2, 19)>
- Node 22: <22, (3, 11, 5)>
- Node 24: (24, 3, 25), (24, 3, 28)
- Node 26: <26, (18, 2, 20)>
- Node 27: (27, 4, 15)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
