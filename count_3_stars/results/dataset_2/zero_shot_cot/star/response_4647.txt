Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 12) (11, 4) (11, 13) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) 

Response:
The center nodes of the 3-stars will be the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. From the given edges, the center nodes can be identified as: 6, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 12, 0, and 13.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

<4, (6, 2, 13)>
<7, (12, 5, 14)>
<1, (9, 3, 10)>
<3, (4, 1, 5)>
<0, (7, 12, 5)>
<12, (9, 7, 8)>
<13, (4, 14, 11)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [7].
