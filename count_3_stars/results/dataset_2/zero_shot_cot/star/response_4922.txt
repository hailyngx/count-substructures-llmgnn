Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node in each 3-star. 
To do that, we need to find nodes with exactly 3 adjacent edges since the center is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes with 3 adjacent edges are: 4, 6, and 8. 

Next, we need to find the neighbors of each central node. 

For node 4, the neighbors are: 5, 6, and 8
For node 6, the neighbors are: 5, 2, and 8
For node 8, the neighbors are: 4, 6, and 1

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by pairing each central node with its neighbors. 

The possible 3-stars are:
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 2, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
