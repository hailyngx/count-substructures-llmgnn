Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of potential 3-stars.

Nodes with three edges connected to them: 0, 1, 2, 3

Now, let's list out the 3-stars by considering each of the identified nodes as the center:

For node 0:
<0, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 6)>
<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>

For node 1:
<1, (5, 2, 6)>
<1, (5, 0, 6)>
<1, (2, 9, 0)>
<1, (0, 6, 7)>

For node 2:
<2, (9, 1, 0)>
<2, (9, 5, 3)>

For node 3:
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (5, 8, 7)>
<3, (9, 2, 4)>
<3, (9, 0, 7)>
<3, (4, 8, 7)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: 15

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
