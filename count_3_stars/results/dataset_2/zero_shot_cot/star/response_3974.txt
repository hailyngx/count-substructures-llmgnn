Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 3) (1, 21) (1, 26) (21, 16) (21, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (27, 15) (27, 20) (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 26) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 18) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 25) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 22) (26, 4) (6, 2) (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 22) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 22) (22, 26) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 29) (4, 26) (4, 14) (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 20) (19, 10) (19, 20) (19, 23) (20, 27) (20, 5) (20, 19) (29, 22) (29, 5) (29, 25) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 10) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 23) (7, 14) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 9) (24, 12) (24, 9) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 24) (9, 17) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 17) (25, 18) (25, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 22, and 4.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 13, 28, and 25.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 28, 3, and 22.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 5, 22, and 25.

Now, let's list the 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 26: <26, (1, 8, 22)>, <26, (1, 22, 4)>
- Node 18: <18, (2, 13, 28)>, <18, (2, 28, 25)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 28, 3)>, <6, (2, 3, 22)>
- Node 29: <29, (5, 22, 25)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 6.
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
