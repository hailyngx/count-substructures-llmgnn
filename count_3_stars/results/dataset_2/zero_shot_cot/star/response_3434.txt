Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 3) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node and its connected leaves. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 9, 14)>
<2, (7, 9, 13)>
<3, (4, 7, 12)>
<5, (11, 13, 6)>
<6, (0, 12, 13)>
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (10, 12, 14)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<10, (7, 8, 9)>
<11, (5, 14, 13)>
<12, (1, 6, 8)>
<13, (2, 4, 5)>
<14, (0, 3, 8)>
