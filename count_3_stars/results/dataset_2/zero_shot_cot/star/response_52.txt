Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
Since a 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes, let's identify all possible 3-stars from the given graph. 

First, let's count the occurrences of each node in the edges to determine the possible central nodes for the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Degree 3
- Node 1: Degree 3
- Node 3: Degree 5
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 6
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 5
- Node 9: Degree 4
- Node 10: Degree 5
- Node 11: Degree 4
- Node 12: Degree 3
- Node 13: Degree 4
- Node 14: Degree 5

Based on the degrees, the central nodes could be 5, 8, 10, or 14. Let's check each possible central node:
- For Node 5: Leaves = 4, 6, 7, 9, 14 (5 configurations)
- For Node 8: Leaves = 1, 3, 10, 12, 14 (5 configurations)
- For Node 10: Leaves = 1, 4, 8, 11, 13 (5 configurations)
- For Node 14: Leaves = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 (5 configurations)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<5, (6, 9, 14)>
<5, (4, 9, 14)>
<8, (1, 3, 12)>
<8, (1, 10, 14)>
<8, (3, 10, 14)>
<8, (1, 14, 7)>
<10, (1, 11, 13)>
<10, (4, 11, 13)>
<10, (1, 8, 12)>
<10, (4, 8, 12)>
<10, (8, 11, 13)>
<14, (3, 11, 13)>
<14, (5, 7, 13)>
<14, (5, 3, 13)>
<14, (7, 11, 13)>
<14, (5, 3, 7)>
<14, (5, 3, 11)>
