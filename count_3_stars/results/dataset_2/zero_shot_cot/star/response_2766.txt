Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 15) (1, 6) (1, 18) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 18) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 6) (7, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 19) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 19) (5, 12) (5, 15) (5, 14) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 10) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 4) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 14) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 5) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes with exactly three edges. Then, we can find the leaves connected to these central nodes. 

1. Nodes with three edges: 
- Node 10
- Node 4

2. Counting the 3-stars:
- For Node 10: (10, 0, 8), (10, 0, 19), (10, 8, 4), (10, 19, 4) <- This node contributes 4 3-stars.
- For Node 4: (4, 17, 10), (4, 19, 10), (4, 9, 19), (4, 17, 13) <- This node contributes 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [8]

Unique 3-stars: 
<10, (0, 8, 19)>
<4, (17, 10, 13)>
