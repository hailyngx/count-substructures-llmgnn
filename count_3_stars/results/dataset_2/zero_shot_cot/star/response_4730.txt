Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<5, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 12)>
<4, (9, 2, 12)>
<7, (0, 11, 6)>
<8, (7, 13, 14)>
<13, (8, 11, 14)>
<6, (7, 8, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 11)>
<11, (7, 13, 3)>
<0, (7, 8, 2)>
<12, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (4, 3, 0)>
<1, (9, 11, 12)>
<14, (8, 13, 12)>
<10, (3, 12, 2)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph gives us [15].
