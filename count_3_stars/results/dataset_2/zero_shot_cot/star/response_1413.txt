Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (4, 9) (4, 3) (12, 2) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 10, 11)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<11, (7, 10, 14)>
