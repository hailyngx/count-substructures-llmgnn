Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 26) (15, 2) (6, 29) (6, 27) (9, 28) (1, 21) (22, 23) (22, 24) (23, 22) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 17) (4, 19) (4, 29) (8, 28) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 7) (26, 15) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 25) (28, 9) (28, 8) (28, 26) (28, 20) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (17, 21) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 27) (10, 21) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 0) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 16) (11, 24) (11, 20) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 5) (2, 15) (2, 19) (29, 6) (29, 4) (29, 26) (29, 0) (27, 6) (27, 17) (27, 5) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 12) (5, 14) (5, 27) (5, 20) (25, 21) (25, 26) (25, 16) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 25) (12, 14) (12, 0) (20, 28) (20, 18) (20, 11) (20, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges, which forms a 3-star.

1. Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 7), (3, 14) -> <3, (15, 7, 14)>
2. Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 26), (15, 2) -> <15, (3, 26, 2)>
3. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 14) -> <7, (3, 8, 14)>
4. Node 14: (14, 3), (14, 7), (14, 12) -> <14, (3, 7, 12)>
5. Node 8: (8, 28), (8, 17), (8, 7) -> <8, (28, 17, 7)>
6. Node 26: (26, 15), (26, 28), (26, 29) -> <26, (15, 28, 29)>
7. Node 28: (28, 9), (28, 8), (28, 26) -> <28, (9, 8, 26)>
8. Node 17: (17, 21), (17, 8), (17, 13) -> <17, (21, 8, 13)>
9. Node 21: (21, 1), (21, 10), (21, 25) -> <21, (1, 10, 25)>
10. Node 4: (4, 19), (4, 29), (4, 0) -> <4, (19, 29, 0)>
11. Node 19: (19, 4), (19, 18), (19, 2) -> <19, (4, 18, 2)>
12. Node 9: (9, 28), (9, 28), (9, 28) (Note: All edges connected to 9 are connected to the same node. This doesn't form a valid 3-star.)

Count of 3-stars: [11]
