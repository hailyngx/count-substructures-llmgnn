Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 10) (0, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 12) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (16, 8) (16, 13) (9, 7) (6, 2) (6, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 12) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 15) 

Response:
Following these steps to count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 13, 18, and 5.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 19.
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 2, 17, and 1.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 13, 4, and 12.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 17, and 1.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 11, 18, and 1.
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 8, 13, and 4.
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 2, 15, and 12.
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 10, 2, and 7.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
There are two unique 3-stars: 
<2, (13, 18, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 19)>

3. Calculate the number of occurrences for each unique 3-star:
- For <2, (13, 18, 5)>:
    - Node 2 as the center occurs twice. (Nodes 13, 18, 5) and (18, 13, 5)
- For <5, (2, 4, 19)>:
    - Node 5 as the center occurs once.
