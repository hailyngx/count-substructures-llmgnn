Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 9) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 12) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 5) (19, 10) (19, 7) (19, 13) (2, 15) (2, 16) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 19) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 6) (6, 3) (6, 13) (5, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes have a degree of 3 in the graph.

The nodes with degree 3 are: 10, 14, 16

Now, let's find all possible 3-stars in the graph using the nodes mentioned above.

1. <10, (11, 17, 19)>
2. <14, (0, 11, 16)>
3. <16, (2, 5, 14)>

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
