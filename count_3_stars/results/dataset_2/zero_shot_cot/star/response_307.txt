Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (9, 2) (9, 14) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star. A central node in a 3-star graph has degree 3 since it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with degree 3 are: 2, 3, 7, and 11.

Now, let's find all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<2, (4, 10, 3)>
<3, (7, 11, 5)>
<7, (12, 14, 5)>
<11, (10, 8, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
