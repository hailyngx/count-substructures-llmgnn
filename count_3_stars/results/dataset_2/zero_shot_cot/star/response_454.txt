Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 6) (13, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 14) (16, 15) (16, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 19) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 4: <3, (1, 0, 4)>
2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 7: <4, (3, 9, 7)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 12, and 19: <6, (17, 12, 19)>
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 4, and 10: <9, (8, 4, 10)>
5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 11: <10, (9, 7, 11)>
6. Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 5: <11, (4, 10, 5)>
7. Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 19: <12, (6, 2, 19)>
8. Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 16, and 14: <15, (1, 16, 14)>
9. Node 16 is connected to nodes 15, 14, and 11: <16, (15, 14, 11)>
10. Node 17 is connected to nodes 6, 11, and 19: <17, (6, 11, 19)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
