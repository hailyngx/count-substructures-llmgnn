Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find the central nodes:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 2, 8, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 2, 9, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, 0, and 9.

Now, let's form the 3-stars with the central nodes and their leaves:
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 2)>
- <5, (1, 6, 4)>
- <5, (1, 6, 8)>
- <8, (2, 9, 7)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 8)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
