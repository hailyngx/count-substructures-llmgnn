Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges incident on them. These nodes will be at the center of the 3-star configurations. 

Now, let's list the nodes based on the number of incident edges:
- Node 6 (with 5 incident edges)
- Node 9 (with 4 incident edges)
- Node 4 (with 5 incident edges)
- Node 7 (with 4 incident edges)
- Node 2 (with 5 incident edges)
- Node 8 (with 4 incident edges)
- Node 0 (with 4 incident edges)
- Node 10 (with 4 incident edges)
- Node 14 (with 3 incident edges)
- Node 1 (with 4 incident edges)
- Node 5 (with 4 incident edges)
- Node 3 (with 5 incident edges)
- Node 11 (with 4 incident edges)
- Node 12 (with 5 incident edges)
- Node 13 (with 4 incident edges)

Based on the above analysis, the only nodes with exactly 3 incident edges are 14. Therefore, we have 1 unique 3-star configuration in this graph:

Final answer: [1]

Unique 3-stars: <14, (6, 10, 9)>
