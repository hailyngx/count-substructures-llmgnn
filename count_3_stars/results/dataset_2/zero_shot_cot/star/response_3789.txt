Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we must identify each unique 3-star pattern.

1. We start by listing the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: (5)
- Node 1: (5, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (9, 6, 7, 1)
- Node 3: (9, 0)
- Node 4: (5, 9, 6)
- Node 5: (9, 6, 8, 1, 0, 4)
- Node 6: (5, 9, 1, 2, 4)
- Node 7: (2, 8, 1)
- Node 8: (5, 0, 7, 1)
- Node 9: (5, 6, 4, 2, 3)

2. Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Central Node: 5
  - Leaves: 9, 6, 8
    - <5, (9, 6, 8)>

- Central Node: 9
  - Leaves: 5, 6, 4
    - <9, (5, 6, 4)>

- Central Node: 6
  - Leaves: 5, 9, 1
    - <6, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
