Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 26) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 27) (4, 22) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 19) (14, 26) (14, 9) (14, 13) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 5) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 29) (10, 21) (10, 3) (26, 7) (26, 0) (26, 14) (26, 3) (25, 9) (25, 19) (27, 21) (27, 24) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 12) (22, 24) (11, 1) (11, 17) (24, 27) (24, 22) (24, 20) (6, 17) (6, 20) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 18) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 25) (9, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 9) (19, 29) (29, 16) (29, 19) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 26) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 20) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 5) (20, 24) (20, 6) (20, 13) (23, 28) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the nodes that are the center of a 3-star in the graph. To do this, we look for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.

The nodes that satisfy this criterion are: 
- Node 4 (edges: (4, 22), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 15))
- Node 1 (edges: (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 11), (1, 16))
- Node 28 (edges: (28, 21), (28, 16), (28, 23))

Next, we can count the number of 3-stars by considering each of these central nodes:

For node 4:
<4, (22, 0, 1)>
<4, (22, 0, 15)>
<4, (22, 1, 15)>
<4, (0, 1, 15)>
Total: 4

For node 1:
<1, (4, 2, 11)>
<1, (4, 2, 16)>
Total: 2

For node 28:
<28, (21, 16, 23)>
Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
