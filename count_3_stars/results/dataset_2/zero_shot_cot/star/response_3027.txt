Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (7, 9, 0)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
