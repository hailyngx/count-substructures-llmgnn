Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 17) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 24) (18, 27) (18, 15) (18, 12) (0, 8) (14, 26) (14, 19) (14, 20) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 22) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 23) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 27) (20, 10) (29, 20) (29, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 22) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 20) (10, 9) (10, 22) (21, 15) (21, 17) (22, 11) (22, 28) (22, 8) (22, 10) (5, 2) (5, 11) (26, 14) (26, 25) (26, 17) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 23) (16, 17) (16, 25) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 21) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 15) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 21) (17, 26) (17, 16) (24, 2) (24, 8) (24, 6) (6, 7) (6, 24) (6, 27) (6, 13) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 6) (13, 7) (13, 28) (13, 12) (13, 6) (25, 26) (25, 16) (23, 28) (23, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with degree 3:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 17, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 24.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 28, 19, and 5.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 26, 19, and 20.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 14, 29, and 27.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 18, and 13.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 17, 25, and 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 18, 21, and 16.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 21.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 24, and 27.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 18, 20, and 6.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 28, and 12.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 26, 16, and 25.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 28, and 12.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
- There are <4, (1, 17, 2)> and <2, (4, 5, 24)>.
- There are <11, (28, 19, 5)> and <14, (26, 19, 20)>.
- There are <20, (14, 29, 27)> and <12, (1, 18, 13)>.
- There is <16, (17, 25, 15)>.
- There is <15, (18, 21, 16)>.
- There is <17, (4, 3, 21)>.
- There is <24, (2, 8, 6)>.
- There is <27, (18, 20, 6)>.
- There is <13, (7, 28, 12)>.
- There is <25, (26, 16, 25)>.
- There is one 3-star <23, (28, 12)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
