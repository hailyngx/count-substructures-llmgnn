Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 12) 

Response:
The given graph has 6 total 3-stars. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 13, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
<7, (4, 11, 14)>
<1, (3, 13, 14)>
<3, (4, 1, 10)>
<14, (9, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
