Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 15) (21, 4) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 22) (17, 18) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 11) (6, 17) (6, 10) (9, 15) (9, 24) (0, 17) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 19) (28, 12) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 22) (19, 15) (26, 5) (26, 12) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 25) (12, 28) (12, 26) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 5) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 25) (5, 26) (5, 7) (5, 10) (11, 14) (11, 29) (11, 8) (11, 27) (22, 17) (22, 19) (22, 24) (15, 21) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 20) (13, 16) (3, 20) (3, 24) (3, 18) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 3) (24, 18) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 5) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 24) (18, 27) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 18) (27, 23) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 16) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (21, 16, 15)>
<2, (29, 25, 7)>
<4, (21, 20, 25)>
<5, (26, 7, 10)>
<6, (17, 10, 6)>
<8, (14, 19, 10)>
<9, (15, 24, 9)>
<11, (14, 29, 8)>
<12, (28, 26, 5)>
<13, (16, 20, 13)>
<17, (6, 0, 22)>
<18, (17, 3, 24)>
<19, (20, 8, 22)>
<23, (29, 7, 27)>
<24, (9, 22, 3)>
<27, (11, 18, 23)>

By counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
