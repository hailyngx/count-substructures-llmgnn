Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 14) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 6) (2, 16) (2, 8) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (8, 2) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (17, 11) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 13) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 13) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 6) (19, 18) (19, 3) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 6) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 14) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would indicate the presence of a 3-star.

Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 15, and 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 17.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 17, and 0.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 16, 9, and 19.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 10, 1)>
<5, (9, 15, 0)>
<9, (5, 18, 17)>
<13, (1, 17, 0)>
<16, (7, 12, 18)>
<18, (16, 9, 19)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
