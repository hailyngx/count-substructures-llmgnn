Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (6, 12) (6, 8) (14, 15) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 9) (13, 19) (13, 16) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 2 possible 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are <4, (19, 0, 5)> and <11, (3, 9, 5)>.
