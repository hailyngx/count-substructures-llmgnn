Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 27) (18, 24) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 0) (22, 17) (20, 1) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 29) (23, 7) (23, 3) (10, 11) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 29) (8, 0) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 19) (26, 25) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 12) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 12) (7, 18) (7, 23) (7, 0) (3, 23) (3, 21) (3, 16) (3, 2) (21, 18) (21, 3) (21, 29) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 2) (4, 27) (27, 18) (27, 4) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 5) (12, 26) (12, 28) (12, 19) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 14) (6, 24) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 6) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 15) (15, 9) (29, 25) (29, 11) (29, 26) (29, 21) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These will be the potential center nodes of a 3-star.
2. For each potential center node, check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. If so, identify the 3 nodes it is connected to and form a 3-star configuration.
3. List the unique 3-star configurations found.

Here are the unique 3-star configurations:
<0, (7, 8, 19)>
<1, (14, 20, 28)>
<2, (3, 5, 16)>
<3, (2, 16, 21)>
<5, (2, 11, 17)>
<7, (0, 18, 23)>
<9, (14, 15, 17)>
<10, (2, 11, 19)>
<11, (10, 14, 29)>
<12, (19, 26, 28)>
<13, (16, 17, 19)>
<14, (1, 9, 11)>
<16, (2, 13, 28)>
<17, (5, 9, 13)>
<18, (0, 21, 27)>
<19, (10, 12, 13)>
<20, (1, 28, 29)>
<21, (18, 23, 29)>
<22, (0, 17, 26)>
<24, (6, 16, 18)>
<25, (17, 26, 29)>
<26, (12, 25, 28)>
<27, (4, 18, 29)>
<28, (1, 12, 26)>
<29, (11, 21, 25)>

Count of 3-stars: [26]
