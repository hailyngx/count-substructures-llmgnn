Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 2, 1)>
<7, (0, 6, 1)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 0, 2)>
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (7, 3, 8)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [9].
