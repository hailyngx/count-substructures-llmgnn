Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 6) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (8, 16) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 19) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 17) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges. 

Let's go through the edges and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 18), (0, 1) <0, (5, 18, 1)>
2. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 18) <4, (9, 8, 18)>
3. Node 5: (5, 16), (5, 8), (5, 0) <5, (16, 8, 0)>
4. Node 6: (6, 11), (6, 3), (6, 15), (6, 10), (6, 14) <6, (11, 3, 15)>
5. Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 0), (7, 19), (7, 14) <7, (5, 0, 19)>
6. Node 8: (8, 16), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 19) <8, (16, 5, 4)>
7. Node 12: (12, 4), (12, 18), (12, 1) <12, (4, 18, 1)>
8. Node 13: (13, 11), (13, 16), (13, 18) <13, (11, 16, 18)>
9. Node 16: (16, 11), (16, 13), (16, 8), (16, 5) <16, (11, 13, 8)>
10. Node 18: (18, 4), (18, 0), (18, 12), (18, 13) <18, (4, 0, 12)>
11. Node 19: (19, 9), (19, 8), (19, 7) <19, (9, 8, 7)>

Thus, there are [11] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
