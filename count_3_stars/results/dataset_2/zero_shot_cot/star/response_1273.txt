Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars. The central nodes must have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

Central nodes: 5, 4, 12, 7, 3, 11, 0, 13

Next, we examine each central node to see if they are part of a 3-star structure. Let's start with node 5:
Node 5 is connected to: 12, 1, 11, 4, 7.
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 11, 4) and a 3-star with nodes (12, 7, 4).

Next, let's check the other central nodes.

<5, (1, 11, 4)>
<5, (12, 7, 4)>

The unique 3-stars found are <5, (1, 11, 4)> and <5, (12, 7, 4)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
