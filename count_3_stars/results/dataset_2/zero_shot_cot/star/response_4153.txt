Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 5, 7, 3
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6

There are no 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [0].
