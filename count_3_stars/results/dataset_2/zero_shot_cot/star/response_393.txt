Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 5) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming the shape of a 3-star. Let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (6, 8, 11)>
<2, (4, 5, 10)>
<3, (9, 13, 10)>
<4, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (8, 12, 0)>
<6, (12, 9, 7)>
<7, (6, 2, 14)>
<8, (5, 14, 0)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>
<10, (4, 3, 14)>
<11, (8, 13, 0)>
<12, (6, 13, 5)>
<13, (12, 11, 3)>
<14, (8, 11, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
