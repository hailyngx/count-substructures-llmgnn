Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 17) (26, 3) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 14) (10, 17) (10, 22) (17, 26) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (8, 27) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (29, 25) (29, 17) (29, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 13) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 24) (16, 6) (16, 23) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 25) (19, 18) (19, 24) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 20) (12, 15) (14, 25) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (13, 21) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 2) (27, 8) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 18) (23, 20) (20, 9) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 23) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 14) (24, 5) (24, 7) (24, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Going through the list of edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<9, (22, 15, 20)>
<26, (17, 3, 25)>
<3, (26, 25, 11)>
<25, (3, 29, 14)>
<17, (26, 10, 29)>
<10, (17, 22, 12)>
<21, (6, 28, 13)>
<28, (21, 20, 13)>
<22, (9, 10, 12)>
<11, (3, 14, 25)>
<1, (13, 0, 13)>
<0, (13, 1, 13)>
<16, (6, 23, 23)>
<18, (29, 19, 14)>
<19, (25, 18, 24)>
<2, (3, 12, 13)>
<12, (22, 2, 20)>
<14, (25, 11, 18)>
<13, (21, 1, 0)>
<27, (8, 7, 24)>
<23, (25, 17, 16)>
<20, (9, 28, 12)>
<15, (9, 18, 14)>
<24, (5, 7, 19)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars we found, we get a total of 24. Therefore, the final answer is [24].
