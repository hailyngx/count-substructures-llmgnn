Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 16) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 17) (5, 17) (5, 15) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 9) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (15, 18, 19)>
<1, (4, 13, 18)>
<2, (4, 7, 17)>
<4, (1, 7, 13)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 15)>
<9, (10, 14, 19)>
<10, (9, 14, 19)>
<11, (13, 14, 19)>
<12, (16, 19, 0)>
<13, (1, 4, 17)>
<14, (9, 11, 17)>
<15, (0, 5, 8)>
<16, (3, 8, 12)>
<17, (2, 5, 13)>
<18, (0, 1, 14)>
<19, (9, 14, 18)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars.
