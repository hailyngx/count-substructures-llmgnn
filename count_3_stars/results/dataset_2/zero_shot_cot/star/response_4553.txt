Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 11, 12)>
<1, (4, 7, 10)>
<2, (6, 7, 12)>
<3, (4, 8, 13)>
<4, (1, 3, 10)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 5, 14)>
<7, (1, 0, 2)>
<8, (3, 11, 14)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<10, (1, 4, 10)>
<11, (0, 3, 8)>
<12, (0, 2, 8)>
<13, (1, 3, 7)>
<14, (2, 6, 8)>

Now, let's calculate the total count of 3-stars in the graph.
