Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (2, 1, 0)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (7, 4, 8)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<0, (5, 6, 1)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [10].
