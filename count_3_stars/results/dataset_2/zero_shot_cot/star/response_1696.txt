Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 0: (0, 5, 2)
- From node 1: (1, 9, 8)
- From node 2: (2, 5, 0)
- From node 3: (3, 9, 6)
- From node 5: (5, 9, 7)
- From node 6: (6, 9, 7)
- From node 7: (7, 5, 6)
- From node 8: (8, 9, 1)
- From node 9: (9, 5, 2)

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
