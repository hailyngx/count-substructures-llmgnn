Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star since it only has one edge.

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
The final answer is [5].
