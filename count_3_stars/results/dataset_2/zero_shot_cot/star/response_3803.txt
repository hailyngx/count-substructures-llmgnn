Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 14) (26, 22) (26, 4) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 5) (2, 13) (2, 27) (2, 4) (8, 15) (8, 25) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 11) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (20, 17) (20, 18) (20, 16) (20, 10) (18, 20) (18, 10) (18, 12) (29, 13) (10, 20) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 23) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 6) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (6, 15) (6, 24) (6, 12) (6, 4) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 21) (24, 6) (24, 19) (24, 25) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 7) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 28) (19, 13) (25, 8) (25, 24) (25, 28) (25, 21) (27, 2) (13, 2) (13, 29) (13, 19) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 6) (28, 19) (28, 25) (21, 11) (21, 25) (21, 23) (23, 10) (23, 21) (5, 14) (5, 7) (4, 26) (4, 2) (4, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 3, 17)>
<2, (4, 13, 27)>
<4, (2, 6, 26)>
<6, (4, 12, 24)>
<7, (1, 5, 14)>
<10, (15, 18, 20)>
<11, (14, 19, 22)>
<13, (2, 19, 29)>
<15, (10, 6, 8)>
<17, (0, 3, 12)>
<19, (11, 13, 24)>
<20, (10, 16, 17)>
<21, (11, 23, 25)>
<22, (9, 11, 26)>
<24, (6, 19, 25)>
<25, (8, 21, 24)>
<26, (4, 22, 26)>
<27, (2, 13, 29)>
<28, (19, 25, 28)>
<29, (13, 27, 19)>

There are a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
