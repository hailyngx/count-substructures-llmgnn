Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

- <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- <8, (5, 4, 6)>
- <1, (4, 0, 2)>
- <0, (5, 4, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
