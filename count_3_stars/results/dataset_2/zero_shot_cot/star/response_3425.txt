Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 14) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can serve as the centers of the 3-stars. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <4, (7, 13, 1)>
2. <5, (7, 13, 14)>
3. <10, (6, 9, 13)>
4. <11, (6, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
