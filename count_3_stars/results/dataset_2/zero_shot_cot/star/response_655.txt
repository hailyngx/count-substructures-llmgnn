Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 9) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5)
