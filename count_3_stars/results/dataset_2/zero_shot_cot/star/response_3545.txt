Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 0) (21, 27) (21, 20) (21, 22) (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 12) (22, 21) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 4) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 15) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 12) (15, 2) (15, 20) (15, 10) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 15) (20, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 28) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 0) (16, 29) (16, 25) (28, 5) (28, 24) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 29) (17, 22) (17, 13) (17, 25) (26, 18) (26, 8) (25, 16) (25, 17) (25, 27) (27, 21) (27, 25) (27, 11) (19, 2) (19, 18) (11, 27) (11, 7) (14, 22) (14, 10) (3, 29) (7, 13) (7, 11) (29, 1) (29, 16) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 8) (8, 26) (8, 29) (8, 24) (8, 0) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 0) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 0) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 24) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. The central node 1 has three leaves: 6, 29, 0. So, <1, (6, 29, 0)> is a 3-star.

2. The central node 21 has three leaves: 27, 20, 22. So, <21, (27, 20, 22)> is a 3-star.

3. The central node 22 has three leaves: 21, 23, 14. So, <22, (21, 23, 14)> is a 3-star.

4. The central node 2 has three leaves: 19, 20, 15. So, <2, (19, 20, 15)> is a 3-star.

5. The central node 13 has three leaves: 9, 5, 17. So, <13, (9, 5, 17)> is a 3-star.

6. The central node 20 has three leaves: 21, 2, 15. So, <20, (21, 2, 15)> is a 3-star.

7. The central node 12 has three leaves: 6, 9, 18. So, <12, (6, 9, 18)> is a 3-star.

8. The central node 29 has three leaves: 1, 16, 10. So, <29, (1, 16, 10)> is a 3-star.

9. The central node 27 has three leaves: 21, 25, 11. So, <27, (21, 25, 11)> is a 3-star.

10. The central node 18 has three leaves: 26, 19, 12. So, <18, (26, 19, 12)> is a 3-star.

11. The central node 15 has three leaves: 2, 20, 10. So, <15, (2, 20, 10)> is a 3-star.

12. The central node 17 has three leaves: 22, 13, 25. So, <17, (22, 13, 25)> is a 3-star.

13. The central node 8 has three leaves: 26, 29, 24. So, <8, (26, 29, 24)> is a 3-star.

14. The central node 0 has three leaves: 1, 13, 8. So, <0, (1, 13, 8)> is a 3-star.

15. The central node 4 has three leaves: 23, 20, 0. So, <4, (23, 20, 0)> is a 3-star.

16. The central node 5 has three leaves: 13, 12, 28. So, <5, (13, 12, 28)> is a 3-star.

17. The central node 10 has three leaves: 15, 12, 14. So, <10, (15, 12, 14)> is a 3-star.

18. The central node 14 has three leaves: 22, 10, 17. So, <14, (22, 10, 17)> is a 3-star.

19. The central node 29 has three leaves: 3, 8, 10. So, <29, (3, 8, 10)> is a 3-star.

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [19].
