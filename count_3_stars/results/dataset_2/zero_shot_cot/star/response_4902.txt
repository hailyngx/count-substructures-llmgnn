Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. A 3-star consists of a center node and three leaves connected to it.

Nodes with degree 3 are potential center nodes for 3-stars.
- Node 5 has degree 5.
- Node 9 has degree 4.
- Node 4 has degree 4.
- Node 7 has degree 5.
- Node 8 has degree 2.
- Node 6 has degree 5.
- Node 2 has degree 2.
- Node 0 has degree 6.
- Node 1 has degree 3.
- Node 3 has degree 4.

Only nodes 5, 7, and 6 can be central nodes in 3-stars.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
1. If node 5 is the central node:
   - (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 1)
   <5, (9, 6, 1)>

2. If node 7 is the central node:
   - (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 8)
   <7, (9, 4, 6)>

3. If node 6 is the central node:
   - (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 2)
   <6, (5, 7, 1)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
