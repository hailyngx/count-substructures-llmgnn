Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 15, possible 3-stars: <15, (19, 5, 17)>
- Node 27, possible 3-stars: <27, (21, 24, 14)>, <27, (21, 24, 11)>, <27, (21, 14, 11)>, <27, (24, 14, 11)>

- Node 29, possible 3-stars: <29, (17, 23, 4)>, <29, (17, 23, 11)>, <29, (17, 4, 11)>, <29, (23, 4, 11)>
- Node 13, possible 3-stars: <13, (8, 28, 7)>
- Node 0, possible 3-stars: <0, (9, 22, 20)>
- Node 20, possible 3-stars: <20, (12, 3, 16)>
- Node 17, possible 3-stars: <17, (15, 6, 9)>, <17, (15, 6, 12)>, <17, (15, 9, 12)>, <17, (6, 9, 12)>
- Node 24, possible 3-stars: <24, (27, 3, 18)>, <24, (27, 3, 5)>, <24, (27, 18, 5)>, <24, (3, 18, 5)>
- Node 26, possible 3-stars: <26, (24, 21, 5)>
- Node 25, possible 3-stars: <25, (2, 7, 10)>
- Node 10, possible 3-stars: <10, (25, 3, 16)>
- Node 3, possible 3-stars: <3, (20, 10, 28)>
- Node 5, possible 3-stars: <5, (15, 22, 24)>
- Node 11, possible 3-stars: <11, (27, 2, 29)>, <11, (27, 2, 14)>, <11, (27, 29, 14)>, <11, (2, 29, 14)>, <11, (2, 29, 4)>
- Node 14, possible 3-stars: <14, (27, 11, 18)>
