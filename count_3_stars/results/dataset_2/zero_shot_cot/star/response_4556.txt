Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars: 
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>

There are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the graph.
