Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 0) (8, 23) (23, 8) (23, 21) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 24) (14, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 22) (17, 20) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 27) (4, 24) (4, 28) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 24) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 2) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 6) (9, 3) (9, 20) (10, 21) (10, 24) (21, 23) (21, 10) (21, 13) (16, 25) (16, 22) (6, 20) (6, 24) (6, 26) (24, 14) (24, 4) (24, 27) (24, 10) (24, 6) (19, 13) (28, 3) (28, 4) (28, 18) (28, 2) (28, 15) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 26) (26, 6) (26, 18) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (29, 27) (29, 7) (15, 14) (15, 28) (15, 13) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 12) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 7) (2, 20) (2, 28) (13, 21) (13, 19) (13, 15) (5, 22) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 22) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) through edges. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (25, 14, 12)>
2. <1, (11, 2, 22)>
3. <2, (1, 7, 28)>
4. <3, (25, 28, 9)>
5. <4, (27, 24, 28)>
6. <6, (20, 24, 26)>
7. <7, (25, 11, 29)>
8. <10, (21, 24, 0)>
9. <13, (21, 19, 15)>
10. <15, (14, 28, 13)>
11. <16, (25, 22, 6)>
12. <17, (2, 20, 18)>
13. <18, (28, 26, 17)>
14. <20, (17, 9, 6)>
15. <21, (23, 10, 13)>
16. <22, (1, 16, 5)>
17. <24, (14, 4, 6)>
18. <25, (3, 7, 16)>
19. <26, (18, 6, 0)>
20. <27, (25, 4, 29)>
21. <28, (3, 4, 18)>
22. <29, (27, 7, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
