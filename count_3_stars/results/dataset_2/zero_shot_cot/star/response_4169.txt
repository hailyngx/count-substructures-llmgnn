Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 22) (27, 10) (27, 28) (27, 17) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 5) (21, 19) (21, 18) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 14) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 24) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 16) (8, 16) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 15) (28, 27) (28, 6) (28, 1) (18, 21) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 15) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (26, 18) (26, 5) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 20) (25, 7) (25, 23) (9, 7) (9, 2) (20, 5) (20, 14) (20, 11) (20, 10) (29, 12) (29, 24) (2, 22) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 11) (19, 21) (19, 18) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (1, 28) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 15) (24, 23) (24, 29) (14, 22) (14, 20) (10, 27) (10, 6) (10, 20) (10, 2) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 2) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 16) (12, 29) (12, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's look for each node and determine if it can be the center of a 3-star. 

For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it needs to be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the nodes that are connected to each node:
- Node 0: (3, 17, 22)
- Node 1: (28)
- Node 2: (22, 9, 10, 17, 11)
- Node 3: (0, 6, 13, 12)
- Node 4: (22, 18, 16)
- Node 5: (7, 13, 26, 20)
- Node 6: (28, 10, 3, 15)
- Node 7: (25, 11, 9, 5)
- Node 8: (16)
- Node 9: (7, 2)
- Node 10: (27, 6, 20, 2)
- Node 11: (7, 13, 20, 2)
- Node 12: (29, 3)
- Node 13: (5, 7, 11, 3)
- Node 14: (22, 20)
- Node 15: (6, 18, 16)
- Node 16: (4, 8, 15)
- Node 17: (0, 27, 2)
- Node 18: (21, 4, 26, 19, 15)
- Node 19: (21, 18)
- Node 20: (5, 11, 14, 10)
- Node 21: (19, 18)
- Node 22: (0, 23, 2, 4, 14)
- Node 23: (22, 25, 24)
- Node 24: (23, 29)
- Node 25: (7, 23)
- Node 26: (18, 5)
- Node 27: (10, 28, 17)
- Node 28: (27, 6, 1)
- Node 29: (12, 24)

Now, let's determine the 3-stars by checking which nodes meet the criteria. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 17, 22)>
<6, (3, 10, 28)>
<18, (4, 15, 19)>
<22, (4, 14, 2)>
<27, (10, 17, 28)>
<29, (12, 24, 5)>

Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
