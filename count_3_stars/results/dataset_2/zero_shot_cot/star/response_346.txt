Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (16, 11) (16, 13) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 28) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 18) (27, 0) (27, 3) (27, 20) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 5) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 1) (23, 12) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 28) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 8) (20, 19) (12, 7) (12, 23) (12, 29) (12, 8) (2, 10) (2, 26) (18, 0) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 14) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 17) (1, 4) (1, 23) (1, 20) (1, 15) (1, 13) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 21) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (17, 19) (17, 26) (17, 9) (17, 21) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 13) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 9) (24, 21) (29, 12) (29, 6) (5, 22) (5, 23) (8, 20) (8, 12) (6, 22) (6, 13) (6, 29) (6, 25) (21, 15) (21, 17) (21, 24) (9, 17) (9, 28) (9, 14) (25, 22) (25, 6) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 9) 

Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them below:

<1, (4, 13, 15)>
<3, (0, 13, 27)>
<5, (22, 23, 6)>
<5, (22, 23, 25)>
<6, (22, 25, 29)>
<7, (4, 12, 28)>
<10, (11, 26, 2)>
<12, (7, 23, 29)>
<13, (16, 1, 3)>
<14, (19, 15, 9)>
<17, (19, 26, 21)>
<21, (15, 17, 24)>
<22, (5, 23, 25)>
<26, (10, 2, 17)>
<28, (7, 10, 9)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we have found 14 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
