Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 15) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 12) (12, 9) (12, 6) (16, 17) (16, 19) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 16) (10, 3) (10, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 13) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 12) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph: 

- <0, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (4, 0, 13)>
- <2, (0, 18, 8)>
- <3, (6, 10, 17)>
- <4, (1, 6, 14)>
- <6, (3, 12, 18)>
- <7, (0, 15, 17)>
- <9, (0, 8, 10)>
- <13, (1, 14, 18)>
- <15, (7, 13, 19)>
- <17, (7, 16, 3)>
- <18, (2, 6, 13)>
- <19, (15, 16, 14)>

Count the number of 3-stars in the graph: [13].
