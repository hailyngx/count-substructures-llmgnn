Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 7) (27, 3) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 18) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 5) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 2) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 17) (1, 20) (1, 14) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 29) (20, 28) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 24) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 5) (26, 10) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 16) (11, 2) (28, 20) (28, 9) (4, 27) (4, 6) (7, 15) (7, 25) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 10) (17, 0) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 8) (9, 28) (9, 29) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 5) (2, 22) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 16) (5, 0) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 29) (10, 26) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 8) (18, 27) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 21) (19, 2) (19, 12) (24, 14) (21, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 12) (12, 22) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 8) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 18) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 
Firstly, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes with 3 connections:  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 16, and 27.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 27, 17, and 22.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 0, 23, and 26.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 15, 1, and 29.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 18, and 24.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 22, 13, and 5.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 26, 12, and 16.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 27, 14, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 28, 29, and 5.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 0, 23, and 5.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 3, 13, and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 26, and 17.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 26, 25, and 6.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 22, 13, and 19.

Now, let's check which of these nodes form 3-stars:

<3, (15, 16, 27)>
<0, (27, 17, 22)>
<22, (0, 23, 26)>
<20, (15, 1, 29)>
<14, (1, 18, 24)>
<26, (22, 13, 5)>
<13, (26, 12, 16)>
<18, (27, 14, 6)>
<9, (28, 29, 5)>
<17, (0, 23, 5)>
<16, (3, 13, 2)>
<5, (0, 26, 17)>
<10, (26, 25, 6)>
<12, (22, 13, 19)>

So, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
