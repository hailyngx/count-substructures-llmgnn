Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 5, 8), (0, 4, 6) (2 unique 3-stars)
2. Node 1: (1, 4, 7) (1 unique 3-star)
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 9) (2 unique 3-stars)
4. Node 3: No 3-star as the degree of node 3 is 3.
5. Node 4: (4, 1, 7), (4, 6, 7), (4, 6, 0), (4, 6, 9) (4 unique 3-stars)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 8), (5, 0, 2), (5, 9, 2), (5, 9, 8) (4 unique 3-stars)
7. Node 6: (6, 4, 7), (6, 1, 7), (6, 0, 4) (3 unique 3-stars)
8. Node 7: (7, 1, 4), (7, 4, 6), (7, 1, 6), (7, 1, 4) (4 unique 3-stars)
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 5), (8, 0, 3) (2 unique 3-stars)
10. Node 9: (9, 5, 2), (9, 5, 8), (9, 4, 2), (9, 4, 7) (4 unique 3-stars)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
