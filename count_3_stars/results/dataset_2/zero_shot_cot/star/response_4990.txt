Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it. 

Given the edges provided in the graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<5, (2, 3, 10)>
<9, (6, 4, 12)>
<6, (1, 12, 0)>
<10, (11, 5, 1)>
<11, (14, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 14, 8)>
<8, (11, 4, 7)>
<7, (11, 8, 3)>
<12, (9, 6, 13)>
<0, (6, 12, 13)>
<14, (11, 4, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<13, (6, 12, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
