Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 18) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 16) (7, 11) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 5) (12, 2) (12, 14) (18, 8) (18, 17) (18, 1) (19, 17) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 16) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 6) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 4) (1, 8) (1, 18) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the leaf nodes connected to it for each 3-star.

First, let's list all the nodes and their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
- <2, (8, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 9, 11)>
- <3, (11, 0, 9)>
- <11, (8, 13, 7)>
- <10, (15, 6, 4)>
- <15, (10, 5, 17)>
- <13, (11, 4, 7)>
- <17, (15, 18, 19)>
- <9, (2, 8, 3)>
- <7, (11, 13, 5)>
- <16, (9, 5, 11)>
- <12, (2, 14, 6)>
- <18, (8, 17, 1)>
- <19, (17, 18, 5)>
- <5, (2, 11, 15)>
- <0, (3, 11, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]
