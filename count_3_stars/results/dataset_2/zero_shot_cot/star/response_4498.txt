Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (7, 11) (7, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node forming a 3-star. Since each 3-star has exactly 3 leaves, we will look for nodes that are connected to the same central node and to no other nodes.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 9, 12)> 
<3, (10, 11, 5)>
<5, (8, 14, 2)>
<13, (0, 4, 12)>

So the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
