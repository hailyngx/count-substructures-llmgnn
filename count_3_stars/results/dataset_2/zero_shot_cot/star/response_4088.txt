Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star configuration. 

Looking at the edges provided, we can see that the nodes involved in the 3-stars are: 

- Node 5 is connected to: 9, 13, 3, 10, 14
- Node 9 is connected to: 5, 14, 1, 13
- Node 1 is connected to: 9, 14, 10, 12
- Node 3 is connected to: 5, 7, 14, 4
- Node 4 is connected to: 3, 0, 11, 6, 2
- Node 0 is connected to: 4, 8, 2, 11, 13
- Node 2 is connected to: 4, 0, 13
- Node 12 is connected to: 1, 6, 11
- Node 8 is connected to: 0, 7, 6
- Node 7 is connected to: 3, 8, 6
- Node 6 is connected to: 4, 8, 7, 12, 13
- Node 10 is connected to: 5, 1
- Node 11 is connected to: 4, 12, 0
- Node 13 is connected to: 5, 9, 0, 2, 14
- Node 14 is connected to: 5, 9, 1, 3, 13

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 

<5, (9, 10, 13)>
<9, (1, 5, 13)>
<1, (10, 12, 14)>
<3, (4, 5, 14)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<0, (2, 11, 13)>
<2, (0, 4, 13)>
<12, (1, 6, 11)>
<8, (6, 7, 0)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (12, 13, 4)>
<10, (1, 5)>
<11, (12, 0, 4)>
<13, (14, 2, 5)>
<14, (1, 3, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
