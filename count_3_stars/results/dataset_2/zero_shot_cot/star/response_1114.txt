Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node in each 3-star. Since each 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can examine each node in the graph and determine if it is the center of a 3-star by checking if it has exactly three neighbors.

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0: Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 6, 14)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 8, 10)>
- Node 4: Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 5: <5, (1, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 7: <7, (5, 12, 2)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 3, 13)>
- Node 9: <9, (6, 13, 11)>
- Node 10: Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 11: Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 12: <12, (7, 5, 0)>
- Node 13: <13, (9, 8, 10)>
- Node 14: <14, (2, 10, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 14)>, <3, (1, 8, 10)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (5, 12, 2)>, <8, (1, 3, 13)>, <9, (6, 13, 11)>
