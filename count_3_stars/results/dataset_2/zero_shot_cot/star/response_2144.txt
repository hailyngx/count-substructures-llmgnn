Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 7) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <3, (1, 4, 5)>
3. <4, (1, 3, 9)>
4. <5, (1, 3, 10)>
5. <10, (11, 14, 5)>
6. <11, (10, 8, 5)>
7. <12, (10, 8, 2)>
8. <13, (11, 12, 9)>
9. <14, (10, 0, 2)>

Thus, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
