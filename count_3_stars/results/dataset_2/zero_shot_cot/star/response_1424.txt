Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (12, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all cases where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since each 3-star contributes one central node and three leaf nodes, we can count the number of unique 3-stars to find the total count.

1. Starting with each node, we check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star.
2. We denote each 3-star found in the format <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>.

Counting the 3-stars:
<5, (9, 0, 12)>
<9, (5, 1, 13)>
<4, (7, 14, 6)>
<7, (4, 14, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 14)>
<3, (1, 11, 0)>
<10, (5, 1, 2)>
<11, (3, 13, 14)>
<8, (7, 1, 2)>
<6, (4, 0, 13)>
<2, (4, 7, 10)>
<12, (5, 0, 0)>
<13, (9, 14, 11)>
