Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify the central node and its connected nodes. 

Let's start by finding all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central Node: 9
   - Connected Nodes: 5, 8, 2
   
   <9, (5, 8, 2)>

2. Central Node: 4
   - Connected Nodes: 1, 6
   
   <4, (1, 6, 8)>

3. Central Node: 8
   - Connected Nodes: 9, 4, 0
   
   <8, (9, 4, 0)>

4. Central Node: 6
   - Connected Nodes: 4, 3, 2
   
   <6, (4, 3, 2)>

5. Central Node: 3
   - Connected Nodes: 9, 6, 0
   
   <3, (9, 6, 0)>

6. Central Node: 7
   - Connected Nodes: 9, 8
   
   <7, (9, 8, 0)>

7. Central Node: 0
   - Connected Nodes: 8, 3, 1
   
   <0, (8, 3, 1)>

8. Central Node: 1
   - Connected Nodes: 5, 4, 8
   
   <1, (5, 4, 8)>

9. Central Node: 2
   - Connected Nodes: 9, 6, 0
   
   <2, (9, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
