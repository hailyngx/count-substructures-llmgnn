Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are 7 unique 3-stars found in this graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
