Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 20) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 23) (3, 17) (3, 11) (25, 4) (25, 22) (12, 9) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 7) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 8) (22, 25) (22, 5) (24, 4) (24, 13) (21, 0) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 28) (13, 24) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 23) (2, 16) (8, 26) (8, 28) (28, 5) (28, 8) (28, 19) (28, 15) (29, 7) (7, 14) (7, 27) (7, 29) (0, 9) (0, 21) (0, 11) (0, 18) (20, 14) (20, 4) (18, 6) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 15) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 23) (16, 19) (23, 17) (23, 2) (23, 16) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 4) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 10) (10, 13) (10, 4) (19, 28) (19, 16) 

Response:
Let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Look for nodes that have exactly three incident edges:
- Node 0 has incident edges (9, 11, 18).
- Node 2 has incident edges (12, 11, 13).
- Node 4 has incident edges (25, 24, 20).
- Node 5 has incident edges (22, 13, 28).
- Node 7 has incident edges (14, 27, 29).
- Node 16 has incident edges (9, 13, 23).
- Node 17 has incident edges (6, 9, 14).
- Node 18 has incident edges (6, 27, 15).
- Node 28 has incident edges (5, 8, 19).

2. Generate the 3-stars considering each of the identified nodes as the center:
- From node 0: <0, (9, 11, 18)>
- From node 2: <2, (12, 11, 13)>
- From node 4: <4, (25, 24, 20)>
- From node 5: <5, (22, 13, 28)>
- From node 7: <7, (14, 27, 29)>
- From node 16: <16, (9, 13, 23)>
- From node 17: <17, (6, 9, 14)>
- From node 18: <18, (6, 27, 15)>
- From node 28: <28, (5, 8, 19)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
