Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 9) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 9) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (7, 6, 2)>
<10, (1, 11, 3)>
<1, (5, 12, 8)>
<3, (10, 9, 2)>
<7, (4, 11, 13)>
<2, (4, 3, 8)>
<0, (10, 8, 12)>
<14, (4, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 12)>
<5, (1, 11, 14)>
<9, (7, 10, 13)>
<12, (1, 8, 6)>
<13, (7, 9, 10)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
