Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 5) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 12) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 4) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 5) (19, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 11) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 16) (16, 2) (16, 6) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 16) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (12, 7, 11)>
<1, (14, 10, 7)>
<2, (17, 18, 19)>
<4, (10, 6, 16)>
<5, (3, 18, 11)>
<6, (0, 4, 16)>
<8, (9, 0, 8)>
<9, (14, 8, 13)>
<13, (17, 9, 13)>
<15, (17, 10, 11)>
<16, (2, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
