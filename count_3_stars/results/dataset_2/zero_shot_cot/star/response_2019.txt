Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 24) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 11) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 20) (15, 22) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 29) (12, 4) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 18) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 25) (20, 14) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 18) (26, 23) (26, 21) (26, 11) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 11) (28, 6) (28, 0) (6, 14) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 11) (1, 17) (1, 25) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 6) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 29) (16, 12) (16, 22) (18, 12) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 19) (22, 15) (22, 16) (22, 25) (29, 7) (29, 23) (29, 13) (0, 21) (0, 28) (24, 9) (24, 27) (24, 8) (25, 8) (25, 1) (25, 22) (13, 3) (13, 29) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star with node 2 as the central node:
   <2, (3, 8, 19)>

2. 3-star with node 6 as the central node:
   <6, (14, 10, 11)>
   <6, (28, 0, 11)>

3. 3-star with node 11 as the central node:
   <11, (17, 21, 26)>
   <11, (6, 10, 23)>

4. 3-star with node 12 as the central node:
   <12, (4, 18, 27)>

5. 3-star with node 17 as the central node:
   <17, (14, 1, 11)>

6. 3-star with node 20 as the central node:
   <20, (14, 2, 19)>

7. 3-star with node 21 as the central node:
   <21, (26, 0, 11)>

8. 3-star with node 22 as the central node:
   <22, (15, 16, 25)>

9. 3-star with node 23 as the central node:
   <23, (26, 11, 29)>

10. 3-star with node 24 as the central node:
    <24, (9, 8, 27)>

11. 3-star with node 25 as the central node:
    <25, (8, 1, 22)>

12. 3-star with node 27 as the central node:
    <27, (12, 18, 24)>

13. 3-star with node 29 as the central node:
    <29, (7, 13, 23)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
