Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

1. Node 4:
- Adjacent nodes: 7, 13, 5, 1, 6
<4, (7, 13, 5)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>

2. Node 7:
- Adjacent nodes: 4, 0, 14, 5, 8
<7, (4, 0, 5)>

3. Node 6:
- Adjacent nodes: 4, 9, 2, 12
<6, (4, 9, 2)>

4. Node 9:
- Adjacent nodes: 6, 3, 13
<9, (6, 3, 13)>

5. Node 8:
- Adjacent nodes: 7, 2, 1
<8, (7, 2, 1)>

6. Node 13:
- Adjacent nodes: 4, 9, 11, 10
<13, (4, 9, 11)>

7. Node 10:
- Adjacent nodes: 13, 11, 3, 12, 1, 2
<10, (13, 11, 3)>

8. Node 11:
- Adjacent nodes: 13, 10
<11, (13, 10, __)> // Leaves are not specified, so it's left blank

9. Node 2:
- Adjacent nodes: 6, 8, 10, 14, 0
<2, (6, 8, 10)>

10. Node 0:
- Adjacent nodes: 7, 2, 5, 1
<0, (7, 2, 5)>

11. Node 3:
- Adjacent nodes: 9, 10, 12
<3, (9, 10, 12)>

12. Node 1:
- Adjacent nodes: 4, 8, 10, 0
<1, (4, 8, 10)>

13. Node 14:
- Adjacent nodes: 7, 2, 5
<14, (7, 2, 5)>

14. Node 5:
- Adjacent nodes: 4, 7, 0, 14, 12
<5, (4, 7, 0)>
<5, (4, 7, 12)>

15. Node 12:
- Adjacent nodes: 6, 10, 3, 5
<12, (6, 10, 3)>
