Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 9) (23, 22) (23, 29) (23, 19) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 24) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 20) (19, 23) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 6) (9, 22) (9, 25) (9, 20) (11, 28) (11, 29) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (21, 5) (7, 25) (10, 12) (10, 20) (15, 17) (4, 6) (4, 27) (4, 1) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 28) (27, 4) (27, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 24) (12, 28) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 0) (16, 27) (16, 24) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 12) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 16) (14, 19) (14, 5) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 9) (20, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (29, 11) (5, 21) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 2, 5.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 13, 24.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 0, 8, 18, 20, 22.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 25, 27.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 6, 27.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 0, 14, 21.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 21, 26.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 25.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 20, 28.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 20, 22, 25.
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 12, 20.
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 28, 29.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 0, 10, 17, 28.
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 1, 22, 25.
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 5, 19.
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 17.
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 24, 27.
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 12, 15, 28.
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 2, 24.
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 14, 23, 27, 29.
- Node 20: Connected to nodes 2, 8, 9, 10, 26.
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 5, 6.
- Node 22: Connected to nodes 2, 9, 13, 23.
- Node 23: Connected to nodes 19, 22, 29.
- Node 24: Connected to nodes 1, 16, 18.
- Node 25: Connected to nodes 3, 7, 9, 13.
- Node 26: Connected to nodes 6, 20.
- Node 27: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 16, 19, 28.
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 8, 11, 12, 17, 27.
- Node 29: Connected to nodes 11, 19, 23.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars. There are 3-star structures with the center node and three leaves nodes. 

Count of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars:
<1, (4, 13, 24)>
<4, (1, 6, 27)>
<5, (0, 14, 21)>
<12, (0, 17, 28)>
<19, (14, 23, 29)>
<20, (9, 10, 26)>
<23, (19, 22, 29)>
<25, (3, 9, 13)>
