Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 28) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 28) (27, 10) (27, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 18) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 19) (21, 24) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 28) (29, 15) (29, 5) (28, 22) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 8) (3, 21) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (25, 7) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 2) (1, 15) (1, 23) (1, 0) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 0) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (16, 25) (16, 26) (6, 22) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 21) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 2) (23, 11) (23, 1) (2, 25) (2, 24) (2, 5) (5, 29) (5, 3) (5, 2) (18, 17) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 0) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 26) (10, 27) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (9, 13) (9, 27) (9, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

1. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 4, and 9: <13, (22, 4, 9)>
2. Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 6, and 28: <22, (13, 6, 28)>
3. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 1, and 29: <15, (20, 1, 29)>
4. Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 3, and 19: <21, (7, 3, 19)>
5. Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 15, and 20: <28, (22, 15, 20)>
6. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 21, 11, and 5: <3, (21, 11, 5)>
7. Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 16, and 4: <25, (7, 16, 4)>
8. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 23, and 0: <1, (15, 23, 0)>
9. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 19, and 10: <8, (20, 19, 10)>
10. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 14, and 25: <4, (13, 14, 25)>
11. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 19, and 24: <6, (22, 19, 24)>
12. Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 1, and 5: <23, (11, 1, 5)>
13. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 25, 24, and 5: <2, (25, 24, 5)>
14. Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 16, and 20: <26, (7, 16, 20)>
15. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 19, and 26: <0, (1, 19, 26)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
Unique 3-stars: <13, (22, 4, 9)>, <22, (13, 6, 28)>, <15, (20, 1, 29)>, <21, (7, 3, 19)>, <28, (22, 15, 20)>, <3, (21, 11, 5)>, <25, (7, 16, 4)>, <1, (15, 23, 0)>, <8, (20, 19, 10)>, <4, (13, 14, 25)>, <6, (22, 19, 24)>, <23, (11, 1, 5)>, <2, (25, 24, 5)>, <26, (7, 16, 20)>, <0, (1, 19, 26)>
