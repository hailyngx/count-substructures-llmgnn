Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three incident edges for potential central nodes of 3-stars.
2. For each central node, check if it forms a 3-star by verifying that the nodes incident to it are not connected to each other.

Let's start the process:

The potential central nodes with exactly three incident edges are: 1, 3, 10, 11, 8, 5, and 12.

Now, let's check each potential central node:

- Central node 1: (1, 2, 3), (1, 0, 9)
- Central node 3: (3, 1, 14), (3, 2, 5)
- Central node 10: (10, 11, 12), (10, 9, 1)
- Central node 11: (11, 7, 6), (11, 5, 12)
- Central node 8: (8, 4, 14), (8, 2, 0)
- Central node 5: (5, 3, 11), (5, 0, 12)
- Central node 12: (12, 10, 11), (12, 5, 9)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (2, 3, 0)>, 
<3, (1, 14, 2)>, 
<3, (2, 5, 0)>,
<10, (11, 12, 9)>, 
<11, (7, 6, 12)>, 
<11, (5, 12, 0)>, 
<8, (4, 14, 2)>, 
<8, (2, 0, 6)>, 
<5, (3, 11, 0)>, 
<5, (0, 12, 3)>, 
<12, (10, 11, 9)>, 
<12, (5, 9, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
