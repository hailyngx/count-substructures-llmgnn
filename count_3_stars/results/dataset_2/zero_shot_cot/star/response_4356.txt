Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 24) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 25) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 15) (18, 28) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 14) (23, 22) (23, 2) (23, 3) (23, 21) (23, 0) (12, 27) (12, 15) (27, 12) (27, 3) (3, 23) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 9) (25, 22) (25, 3) (0, 23) (0, 24) (6, 29) (6, 1) (6, 19) (28, 18) (28, 3) (5, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 1) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 15) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 21) (19, 17) (14, 10) (14, 26) (14, 4) (14, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 20) (1, 24) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 9) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 21) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 8) (15, 14) (21, 23) (21, 19) (21, 26) (21, 9) (4, 16) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (11, 16, 2)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (22, 24, 7)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, (13, 23, 25)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star: <29, (2, 20, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (23, 27, 25)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (5, 24, 15)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star: <19, (6, 8, 21)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (10, 26, 4)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
