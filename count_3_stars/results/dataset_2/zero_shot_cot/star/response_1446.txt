Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. A 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges in the graph, the unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<3, (9, 7, 4)>
<2, (1, 4, 0)>
<8, (3, 7, !)>
<0, (5, 6, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in total.
