Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 17) (7, 10) (7, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 0) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (9, 3) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 16) (6, 1) (6, 2) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 14) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 6) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (4, 10, 17)>
<1, (11, 14, 16)>
<2, (6, 15, 19)>
<3, (9, 10, 11)>
<5, (10, 16, 19)>
<8, (16, 19, 8)>
<13, (5, 15, 18)>
<14, (1, 12, 18)>
<15, (2, 12, 13)>
<16, (1, 12, 14)>
<18, (13, 14, 19)>

There are [10] 3-stars in the graph.
