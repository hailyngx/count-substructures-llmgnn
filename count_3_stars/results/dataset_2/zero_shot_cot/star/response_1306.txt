Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them based on the provided edge list.

1. Starting from each node, we check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.
2. Once we find a 3-star, we list it in the <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> format.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 14)>
<3, (1, 7, 13)>
<10, (11, 6, 14)>
<11, (3, 10, 9)>
<0, (14, 5, 13)>
<14, (1, 10, 0)>
<2, (11, 5, 0)>
<8, (5, 7, 0)>
<7, (3, 14, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 13, 5)>
<6, (10, 0, 14)>
<12, (1, 11, 5)>
<13, (3, 0, 14)>
<9, (10, 11, 12)>

Counting the above 3-stars, we find a total of 15 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
