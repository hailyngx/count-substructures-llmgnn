Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 9) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 4) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 11) (4, 21) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 7) (6, 2) (28, 26) (28, 22) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 26) (26, 28) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 11) (5, 18) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (16, 12) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 3) (9, 1) (9, 29) (9, 3) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 25) (29, 24) (0, 21) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (25, 29) (25, 27) (25, 11) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 11) (10, 1) (12, 13) (12, 16) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 9) (3, 7) (24, 29) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 23) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 23) (23, 14) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 15) (2, 6) (2, 7) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 13) (11, 25) (11, 27) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (21, 1, 19)>
<1, (10, 9, 21)>
<2, (6, 3, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 18)>
<4, (21, 22, 8)>
<5, (18, 19, 23)>
<6, (2, 7, 3)>
<7, (8, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 15, 19)>
<9, (1, 10, 29)>
<10, (1, 9, 13)>
<11, (17, 26, 13)>
<12, (13, 16, 19)>
<13, (21, 12, 11)>
<14, (17, 18, 23)>
<15, (17, 8, 23)>
<16, (12, 13, 21)>
<17, (14, 11, 15)>
<18, (14, 5, 26)>
<19, (21, 13, 8)>
<20, (8, 23, 26)>
<21, (0, 19, 4)>
<22, (26, 4, 28)>
<23, (15, 14, 20)>
<24, (29, --, --)>
<25, (29, 27, 11)>
<26, (22, 28, 18)>
<27, (29, 25, 11)>
<28, (26, 22, --)>
<29, (9, 24, 27)>

There are 28 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [28].
