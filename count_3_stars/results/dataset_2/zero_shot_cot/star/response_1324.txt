Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 8) (9, 1) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

Based on the provided edges, the nodes with exactly three edges are:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 6, 13, and 8)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 5, 14, and 3)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 5, 12, and 3)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 6, 7, and 1)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 5, 4, and 2)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 5, 7, and 12)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars <center, (leaves)>:
<5, (6, 13, 8)>
<6, (5, 14, 3)>
<7, (5, 12, 3)>
<12, (6, 7, 1)>
<13, (5, 4, 2)>
<8, (5, 7, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
