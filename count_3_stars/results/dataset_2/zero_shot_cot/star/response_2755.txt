Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 10) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 21) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 8) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 4) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 10) (9, 29) (9, 21) (9, 11) (23, 18) (23, 25) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 29) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 25) (5, 12) (5, 24) (28, 3) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 20) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 27) (26, 24) (26, 21) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 26) (24, 12) (0, 28) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 2) (18, 23) (18, 0) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 16) (10, 13) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 6) (16, 0) (16, 29) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 8) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 20) (20, 28) (20, 12) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 27) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 26) (21, 19) (2, 7) (27, 1) (27, 19) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 13 is connected to nodes 12, 15, and 10.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 21.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 28, and 8.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 22, 17, and 7.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 22, 14, and 25.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 28, 24, and 10.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 17, 8, and 19.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 13, 3, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 15, 11, and 27.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 6, 5, and 12.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<13, (12, 15, 10)>
<22, (14, 17, 21)>
<3, (15, 28, 8)>
<14, (22, 17, 7)>
<17, (22, 14, 25)>
<6, (28, 24, 10)>
<4, (17, 8, 19)>
<15, (13, 3, 1)>
<1, (15, 11, 27)>
<24, (6, 5, 12)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
