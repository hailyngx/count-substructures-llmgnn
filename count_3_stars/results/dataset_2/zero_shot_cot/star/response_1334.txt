Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 14) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

We will list out all possible 3-stars using the given edges and then count the total unique 3-stars.

The 3-star patterns are as follows:
1. <0, (7, 3, 11)>
2. <1, (8, 13, 2)>
3. <2, (7, 11, 12)>
4. <4, (7, 8, 10)>
5. <5, (3, 14, 12)>
6. <6, (0, 12, 14)>
7. <7, (4, 8, 2)>
8. <8, (4, 9, 1)>
9. <9, (8, 11, 7)>
10. <10, (4, 7, -)>
11. <11, (3, 9, 14)>
12. <12, (5, 2, 6)>
13. <13, (8, 1, 14)>
14. <14, (8, 11, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [14].
