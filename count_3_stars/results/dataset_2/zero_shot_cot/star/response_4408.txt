Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 4) (22, 25) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 23) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 19) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 19) (6, 28) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 12) (7, 17) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 21) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 16) (21, 12) (21, 24) (24, 21) (1, 14) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 15) (5, 19) (5, 26) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 23) (20, 27) (20, 29) (10, 1) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 26) (15, 25) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 3) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 15) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (25, 22) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 18) (11, 6) (11, 18) (2, 27) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 2) (23, 27) (23, 17) (23, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 25) (18, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<27, (0, 20, 23)> - with node 27 as the center
<28, (6, 19, 29)> - with node 28 as the center
<6, (4, 11, 14)> - with node 6 as the center
<7, (8, 12, 17)> - with node 7 as the center
<12, (7, 21, 24)> - with node 12 as the center
<1, (2, 10, 17)> - with node 1 as the center
<17, (1, 15, 25)> - with node 17 as the center
<5, (19, 26, 28)> - with node 5 as the center
<8, (7, 18, 26)> - with node 8 as the center
<9, (8, 15, 23)> - with node 9 as the center
<15, (9, 16, 25)> - with node 15 as the center
<16, (3, 14, 15)> - with node 16 as the center
<4, (2, 6, 22)> - with node 4 as the center
<22, (4, 25, 27)> - with node 22 as the center
<11, (6, 18, 28)> - with node 11 as the center

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
