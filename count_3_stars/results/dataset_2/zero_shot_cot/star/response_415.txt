Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 8) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 8) (20, 24) (25, 20) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 10) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 27) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 9) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 26) (1, 4) (1, 20) (1, 12) (17, 13) (6, 18) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 29) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 16) (23, 26) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 23) (14, 12) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 0) (0, 18) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 12) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 28) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star by finding the central node and the three leaves that are connected to it.

Let's identify all the 3-stars:

- Central node: 15, Leaves: 27, 9, 24 <15, (27, 9, 24)>
- Central node: 27, Leaves: 15, 8, 28 <27, (15, 8, 28)>
- Central node: 4, Leaves: 1, 29, 2 <4, (1, 29, 2)>
- Central node: 7, Leaves: 3, 10, 21 <7, (3, 10, 21)>
- Central node: 18, Leaves: 19, 6, 0 <18, (19, 6, 0)>
- Central node: 22, Leaves: 16, 0, 3 <22, (16, 0, 3)>
- Central node: 20, Leaves: 25, 1, 24 <20, (25, 1, 24)>
- Central node: 5, Leaves: 29, 16, 0 <5, (29, 16, 0)>
- Central node: 3, Leaves: 7, 22, 0 <3, (7, 22, 0)>
- Central node: 10, Leaves: 7, 28, 12 <10, (7, 28, 12)>
- Central node: 1, Leaves: 4, 20, 12 <1, (4, 20, 12)>
- Central node: 19, Leaves: 18, 26, 9 <19, (18, 26, 9)>
- Central node: 26, Leaves: 19, 23, 11 <26, (19, 23, 11)>
- Central node: 11, Leaves: 28, 19, 26 <11, (28, 19, 26)>
- Central node: 13, Leaves: 29, 17, 21 <13, (29, 17, 21)>
- Central node: 23, Leaves: 26, 21, 14 <23, (26, 21, 14)>
- Central node: 14, Leaves: 23, 12, 5 <14, (23, 12, 5)>
- Central node: 16, Leaves: 22, 13, 5 <16, (22, 13, 5)>
