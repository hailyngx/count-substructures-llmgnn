Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 0) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with the highest degree in the graph as they have the potential to be the central nodes of the 3-stars. 
Nodes with the highest degree are: 5, 4, 9, 10, 13, 3, 14, 7, 11, 1, 2, 0, and 8 with degree 5.

Next, we can determine the 3-stars in the graph. 
From the given edges, we can see that these 3-stars exist:
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 11, 13)>
<4, (5, 7, 14)>
<7, (9, 4, 2)>
<3, (5, 4, 11)>
<11, (9, 12, 1)>
<13, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (7, 12, 13)>
<1, (8, 11, 10)>
<0, (3, 11, 2)>
<14, (4, 8, 12)>
<10, (5, 9, 8)>

Hence, there are 12 different 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
