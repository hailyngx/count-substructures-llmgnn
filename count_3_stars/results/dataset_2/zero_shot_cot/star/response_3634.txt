Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 5) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 6) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 18) (9, 10) (9, 2) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 9) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 11 to find the possible 3-stars involving node 11 as the center. Here are the nodes connected to node 11: 0, 12, 13, 16, 17.

1. With node 0: (11, 0), (12, 11), (18, 0)
2. With node 12: (11, 12), (12, 5), (5, 4)
3. With node 13: (11, 13), (13, 2)
4. With node 16: (11, 16), (16, 7), (7, 2)
5. With node 17: (11, 17), (17, 3), (3, 1)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. After analyzing the connections, we find the following unique 3-stars:

<11, (0, 12, 18)>
<12, (11, 5, 4)>
<13, (11, 2)>
<16, (11, 7, 2)>
<17, (11, 3, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
