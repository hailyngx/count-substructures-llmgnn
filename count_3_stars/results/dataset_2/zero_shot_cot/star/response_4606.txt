Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node by exactly three edges. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars.

Nodes connected to 6: 1, 4, 8, 0
Nodes connected to 9: 4, 1, 7
Nodes connected to 1: 6, 9, 5
Nodes connected to 3: 7, 0, 8
Nodes connected to 4: 6, 9, 8, 0, 5
Nodes connected to 8: 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7
Nodes connected to 2: 8, 5, 0
Nodes connected to 7: 9, 3, 8, 5
Nodes connected to 5: 1, 4, 8, 2, 7
Nodes connected to 0: 6, 3, 4, 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Based on the connections, the 3-stars are:
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 0, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 9, 5)>
<3, (7, 0, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 4)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<8, (6, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 7)>
<2, (8, 5, 0)>
<7, (9, 3, 7)>
<5, (4, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 8, 7)>
<0, (6, 3, 0)>
<0, (4, 2, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
