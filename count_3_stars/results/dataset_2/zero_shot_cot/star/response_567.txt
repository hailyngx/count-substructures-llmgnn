Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (4, 7) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 12) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 19) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 16) (13, 14) (13, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) (19, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be our potential centers for 3-stars.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 9

Now, for each potential center, let's list the 3-stars:
- For Node 0:
  - <0, (8, 16, 18)>
- For Node 2:
  - <2, (1, 6, 11)>
- For Node 9:
  - <9, (8, 3, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
