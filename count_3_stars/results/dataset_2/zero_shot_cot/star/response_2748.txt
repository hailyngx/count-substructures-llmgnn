Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 14) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 18) (27, 19) (27, 23) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 18) (5, 23) (5, 10) (5, 16) (6, 20) (6, 0) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 14) (11, 28) (11, 4) (28, 11) (28, 25) (28, 23) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 25) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 19) (18, 27) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 3) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 28) (23, 9) (4, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 16) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 9) (7, 14) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 25) (22, 21) (22, 16) (22, 12) (22, 3) (16, 5) (16, 29) (16, 2) (16, 22) (20, 6) (25, 28) (25, 0) (25, 24) (25, 14) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 7) (14, 25) (14, 12) (12, 15) (12, 22) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (6, 10, 25)>
<2, (10, 16, 17)>
<3, (12, 22, 26)>
<5, (10, 16, 23)>
<6, (0, 20, 26)>
<7, (14, 21, 25)>
<8, (13, 18, 27)>
<9, (1, 19, 23)>
<11, (4, 11, 28)>
<12, (3, 14, 22)>
<14, (7, 12, 25)>
<15, (12, 14, 29)>
<16, (2, 16, 22)>
<17, (2, 17, 26)>
<18, (3, 13, 27)>
<19, (1, 9, 27)>
<20, (0, 6, 26)>
<21, (14, 21, 25)>
<22, (3, 12, 16)>
<23, (5, 9, 28)>
<24, (10, 24, 25)>
<25, (14, 25, 28)>
<26, (0, 3, 21)>
<27, (18, 19, 23)>
<28, (11, 25, 23)>
<29, (14, 15, 29)>

There are a total of [27] 3-stars in the given graph.
