Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 0) (14, 11) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (4, 7, 13)>
2. <3, (6, 12, 13)>
3. <7, (4, 6, 12)>
4. <9, (1, 6, 8)> 

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
