Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges: 0, 2, 5, 8

Next, for each of these nodes, let's find the nodes that are connected to it, which will form the leaves of the respective 3-stars.

For node 0, the connected nodes are: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (0, 3, 8)>

For node 2, the connected nodes are: 3, 5, 7, 9
<2, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (2, 3, 5)>

For node 5, the connected nodes are: 2, 6, 7, 8
<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (7, 6, 8)>
<5, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 8, the connected nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 3, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 8)>

Thus, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [7].
