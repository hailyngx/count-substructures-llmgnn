Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From node 5: <5, (1, 3, 6)>
2. From node 6: <6, (0, 4, 9)>
3. From node 1: <1, (5, 3, 4)>
4. From node 3: <3, (5, 1, 4)>
5. From node 4: <4, (6, 1, 3)>
6. From node 9: <9, (6, 0, 3)>
7. From node 0: <0, (6, 4, 9)>
8. From node 2: None
9. From node 8: None
10. From node 7: None

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The total number of 3-stars is [7].
