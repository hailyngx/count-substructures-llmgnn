Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 3) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars.

1. Starting with node 0: (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5)
   <0, (4, 14, 5)>

2. Moving to node 1: (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7)
   <1, (6, 9, 4)> <1, (6, 4, 7)>

3. Checking node 2: (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7)
   <2, (9, 10, 8)> <2, (9, 7, 8)> <2, (10, 8, 7)>

4. Moving on to node 3: (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13)
   <3, (9, 10, 11)> <3, (9, 10, 14)> <3, (9, 11, 13)> <3, (10, 11, 14)>

5. Checking node 4: (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1)
   <4, (6, 8, 0)> <4, (6, 8, 5)> <4, (6, 0, 1)>

6. Moving to node 5: (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14)
   <5, (10, 4, 7)> <5, (10, 4, 0)> <5, (10, 4, 14)> <5, (4, 7, 0)> <5, (7, 0, 14)>

7. Checking node 6: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13)
   <6, (1, 4, 13)>

8. Moving on to node 7: (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1)
   <7, (8, 2, 5)> <7, (8, 2, 1)> <7, (2, 5, 1)>

9. Checking node 8: (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7)
   <8, (4, 2, 12)>

10. Moving to node 9: (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1)
    No 3-star centered at node 9.

11. Checking node 10: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5)
    <10, (11, 3, 13)>

12. Moving on to node 11: (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12)
    No 3-star centered at node 11.

13. Checking node 12: (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14)
    No 3-star centered at node 12.

14. Moving to node 13: (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 3)
    No 3-star centered at node 13.

15. Checking node 14: (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5)
    <14, (12, 3, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: 8
Answer: [8]
