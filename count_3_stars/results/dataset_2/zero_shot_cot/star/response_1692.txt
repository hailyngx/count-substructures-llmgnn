Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 13) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 5) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 1) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (18, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 10) (5, 1) (12, 19) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the given graph, and the count is inside the brackets at the end of the answer.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (8, 10, 19)>
<1, (5, 11, 16)>
<2, (10, 17, 2)>
<3, (5, 9, 15)>
<4, (0, 16, 4)>
<5, (1, 10, 14)>
<6, (9, 10, 6)>
<7, (8, 15, 19)>
<8, (0, 7, 13)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
<10, (0, 2, 10)>
<11, (1, 16, 19)>
<12, (19, 12, 0)>
<13, (8, 17, 13)>
<14, (5, 19, 14)>
<15, (3, 7, 15)>
<16, (1, 4, 16)>
<17, (2, 13, 17)>
<18, (7, 18, 7)>
<19, (0, 11, 19)>
