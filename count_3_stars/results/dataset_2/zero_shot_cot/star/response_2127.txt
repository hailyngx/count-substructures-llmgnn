Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (18, 15) (19, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 10) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 19) (13, 4) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 15, 16, 4, and 1.
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 0, 11, and 8.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3 and 15.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 7, 9, and 2.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 6, 0, and 13.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 8, 4, and 13.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 4, and 17.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 9, and 10.
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 17, 5, 1, and 12.
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 3, 11, 7, and 13.
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 3, 7, and 13.
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 14, 1, 9, and 12.
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 14, 11, 8, and 13.
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 19, 4, 10, and 12.
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 17, 11, 12, and 16.
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 0, 18, 2, and 3.
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 14 and 0.
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 14, 6, 8, and 1.
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 15.
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 13.

Now, let's find and count the 3-stars:
- <0, (15, 16, 4)> 
- <1, (6, 11, 8)>
- <2, (3, 15, 0)>
- <3, (7, 9, 2)>
- <4, (5, 6, 0)>
- <5, (8, 4, 13)>
- <6, (1, 4, 17)>
- <7, (9, 10, 3)>
- <8, (17, 5, 1)>
- <9, (11, 7, 13)>
- <10, (13, 3, 7)>
- <11, (14, 9, 12)>
- <12, (14, 13, 8)>
- <13, (19, 4, 10)>
- <14, (17, 11, 12)>
- <15, (18, 2, 3)>
- <16, (14, 0)>
- <17, (14, 6, 8)>
- <18, (15)>
- <19, (13)>
