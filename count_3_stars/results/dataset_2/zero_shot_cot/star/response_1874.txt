Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 1) (13, 14) (13, 15) (8, 5) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 15) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 16) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 9) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars. 

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 10 since it has degree 4, making it a candidate for a center node in the 3-stars. The nodes connected to node 10 are 11, 3, 7, and 14.

Next, we will check all possible 3-stars:
1. For center node 10:
   - <10, (11, 7, 14)>
   [There is 1 unique 3-star starting from node 10]

2. For center node 11:
   - <11, (10, 19, 0)>
   [There are no 3-stars starting from node 11]

3. For center node 3:
   - <3, (10, 14, 2)>
   [There are no 3-stars starting from node 3]

4. For center node 7:
   - <7, (10, 12, 1)>
   [There is 1 unique 3-star starting from node 7]

5. For center node 14:
   - <14, (10, 13, 3)>
   [There are no 3-stars starting from node 14]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <10, (11, 7, 14)> and <7, (10, 12, 1)>.
