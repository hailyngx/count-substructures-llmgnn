Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to three other nodes by edges. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. (5, 9, 6)
2. (5, 2, 1)
3. (5, 8, 7)
4. (5, 3, 1)
5. (9, 6, 0)
6. (4, 7, 0)
7. (4, 2, 1)
8. (7, 4, 1)
9. (1, 3, 7)
10. (3, 5, 9)
11. (3, 7, 8)
12. (3, 1, 2)
13. (6, 9, 5)
14. (6, 1, 2)
15. (8, 5, 3)
16. (8, 7, 4)
17. (0, 7, 4)
18. (2, 5, 8)
19. (2, 4, 1)
20. (2, 1, 3)

There are a total of 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
<5, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (7, 0, 2)>, <3, (5, 9, 3)>, <6, (9, 1, 2)>, <8, (5, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 1, 3)>, <1, (3, 2, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <0, (7, 4, 2)>
