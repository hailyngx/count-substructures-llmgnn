Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 19) (5, 16) (5, 17) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 10) (19, 12) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 3) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 19) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 11 to see if any of them form 3-stars. 

Nodes connected to node 11: 4, 8, 14, 17

Now, let's check if there are any 3-stars centered around node 11:

- <11, (4, 8, 17)> [1]

Next, let's move on to the other nodes to see if there are any additional 3-stars.

Nodes connected to node 16: 2, 5, 7

Nodes connected to node 14: 1, 15, 11

Nodes connected to node 17: 2, 5, 11, 15

Nodes connected to node 6: 9, 12

Nodes connected to node 9: 4, 10, 15, 6

Nodes connected to node 4: 9, 11

Nodes connected to node 8: 1, 11

Nodes connected to node 7: 12, 3, 16

Nodes connected to node 12: 0, 6, 7, 18, 19

Nodes connected to node 5: 16, 17

Nodes connected to node 10: 9, 13, 15, 18

Nodes connected to node 15: 9, 10, 13, 14, 17

Nodes connected to node 18: 10, 12

Nodes connected to node 19: 1, 12, 13

Nodes connected to node 3: 2, 7

Nodes connected to node 1: 8, 14, 19

Nodes connected to node 2: 3, 5, 16, 17

Nodes connected to node 13: 10, 15, 19

Nodes connected to node 0: 12

Based on the analysis, the unique 3-stars found are:

- <11, (4, 8, 17)> [1]
