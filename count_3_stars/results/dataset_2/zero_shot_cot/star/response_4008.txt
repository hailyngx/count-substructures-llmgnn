Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 8) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes would represent the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 12, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<7, (4, 12, 3)>
<6, (9, 14, 10)>
<12, (5, 4, 7)>
<0, (9, 14, 2)>
<14, (6, 0, 1)>
<2, (9, 7, 0)>
<10, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (7, 14, 8)>
<8, (2, 10, 11)>
<13, (5, 4, 6)>
<11, (6, 2, 8)>
<3, (7, 6, 12)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get: [15].
