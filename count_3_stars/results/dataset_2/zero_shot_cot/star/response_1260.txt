Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the sets of nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can find the 3-stars by looking for nodes connected to three other nodes.

Let's start by listing the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
