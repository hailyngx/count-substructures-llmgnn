Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 13) (15, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 3) (17, 16) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 15) (13, 6) (13, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 18) (16, 17) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 11) (8, 10) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 19) (18, 3) (18, 7) (18, 11) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 18) (4, 1) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the central nodes of potential 3-stars. The nodes with 3 edges are: 3, 15, 14, 17, 6, 1, 7, 0, 10, 12, 19, and 11.

Next, let's identify the leaves connected to each central node:
- For node 3: 15, 17, 14
- For node 15: 3, 1, 13
- For node 14: 3, 12, 19
- For node 17: 3, 16
- For node 6: 9, 2, 0
- For node 1: 15, 4, 0
- For node 7: 5, 9, 1
- For node 0: 6, 1, 12
- For node 10: 9, 0, 12
- For node 12: 14, 0, 10, 19
- For node 19: 14, 6, 13, 12
- For node 11: 15, 2, 18

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<3, (15, 17, 14)>
<15, (3, 1, 13)>
<14, (3, 12, 19)>
<17, (3, 16)>
<6, (9, 2, 0)>
<1, (15, 4, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<0, (6, 1, 12)>
<10, (9, 0, 12)>
<12, (14, 0, 10, 19)>
<19, (14, 6, 13, 12)>
<11, (15, 2, 18)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
