Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 18) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 5) (8, 2) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 19) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 16) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 10: <10, (17, 3, 7)>
2. For node 11: <11, (19, 9, 13)>
3. For node 17: <17, (10, 1, 12)>
4. For node 5: <5, (6, 8, 18)>
5. For node 6: <6, (5, 18, 16)>
6. For node 2: <2, (8, 19, 14)>
7. For node 8: <8, (5, 2, 18)>
8. For node 4: <4, (13, 1, 0)>
9. For node 18: <18, (5, 6, 7)>
10. For node 1: <1, (17, 4, 0)>
11. For node 9: <9, (11, 14, 13)>
12. For node 12: <12, (17, 16, 19)>
13. For node 16: <16, (5, 12, 0)>
14. For node 15: <15, (2, 19, 14)>
15. For node 19: <19, (11, 2, 12)>
16. For node 3: <3, (10, 0, 7)>
17. For node 7: <7, (10, 18, 19)>
18. For node 14: <14, (2, 9, 15)>

Total number of 3-stars within the graph: [18]
