Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with maximum degree. Node 5 has a degree of 5, nodes 7, 8, and 9 have a degree of 4, and the remaining nodes have a degree of 3. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph.

1. <5, (9, 7, 3)>
2. <5, (9, 0, 8)>
3. <5, (9, 7, 0)>
4. <9, (5, 6, 1)>
5. <9, (5, 7, 6)>
6. <4, (8, 2, 6)>
7. <7, (5, 9, 0)>
8. <6, (9, 4, 1)>
9. <1, (9, 6, 3)>
10. <3, (5, 1, 8)>
11. <8, (5, 4, 3)>
12. <0, (5, 9, 7)>
13. <2, (4, 7, 3)>

Hence, there are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
