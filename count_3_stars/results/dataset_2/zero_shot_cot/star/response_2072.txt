Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 2) (9, 16) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 29) (23, 19) (23, 15) (23, 29) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 26) (1, 15) (1, 29) (26, 1) (26, 18) (26, 7) (2, 9) (2, 12) (21, 4) (21, 28) (21, 19) (28, 17) (28, 21) (28, 5) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 5) (20, 17) (20, 3) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 7) (19, 23) (19, 21) (18, 17) (18, 26) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 7) (12, 2) (12, 29) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 24) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 25) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 1) (29, 12) (25, 14) (25, 9) (25, 24) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 24) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 24) (27, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (26, 15, 29)>
2. <2, (9, 12, 29)>
3. <4, (8, 13, 21)>
4. <5, (28, 13, 7)>
5. <6, (9, 7, 6)>
6. <7, (26, 5, 10)>
7. <8, (4, 0, 10)>
8. <9, (6, 25, 2)>
9. <10, (15, 27, 8)>
10. <11, (22, 15, 24)>
11. <13, (4, 5, 13)>
12. <14, (3, 25, 17)>
13. <15, (11, 15, 1)>
14. <16, (4, 9, 16)>
15. <17, (14, 28, 20)>
16. <18, (17, 26, 18)>
17. <19, (21, 23, 19)>
18. <22, (29, 11, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
