Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (2, 13) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 11) (13, 2) (13, 18) (7, 6) (7, 5) (16, 5) (16, 18) (0, 10) (18, 9) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 16) (11, 5) (11, 1) (12, 10) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we will find all possible combinations of three nodes connected to each center node.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 3: (2, 9, 15)
- Node 6: (5, 7, 17)
- Node 10: (0, 12, 17)
- Node 15: (1, 4, 8)
- Node 18: (8, 13, 16)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:

<[3, (2, 9, 15)]>
<[6, (5, 7, 17)]>
<[6, (5, 10, 12)]>
<[6, (7, 5, 17)]>
<[6, (7, 5, 12)]>
<[10, (0, 12, 17)]>
<[15, (1, 4, 8)]>
<[18, (8, 13, 16)]>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
