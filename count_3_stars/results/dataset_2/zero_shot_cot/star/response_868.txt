Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the central node in each potential 3-star.

For each node, we will look for nodes that are connected to it with an edge, and to the central node with another edge. If we find exactly two such nodes for a given node as the central node, we have a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 2)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
