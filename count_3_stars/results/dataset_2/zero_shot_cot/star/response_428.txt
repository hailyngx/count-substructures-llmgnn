Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

First, let's list the nodes and their adjacent nodes based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 4: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 4, 9
- Node 8: 4, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 4, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 9: <1, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <3, (1, 2, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
