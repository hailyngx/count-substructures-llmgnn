Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the edges, the nodes that form a 3-star can be determined as follows:
1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7. Hence, node 5 is the central node of three 3-stars: <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, and <5, (1, 4, 7)>.
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 5. Hence, node 9 is the central node of one 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 7)>.
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 9. Hence, node 6 is the central node of one 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 7)>.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5. Hence, node 4 is the central node of one 3-star: <4, (0, 2, 3)>.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 9. Hence, node 7 is the central node of one 3-star: <7, (0, 6, 9)>.
6. Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8. Hence, node 2 is the central node of one 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 8)>.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6. Hence, node 8 is the central node of one 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 6)>.
8. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6. Hence, node 1 is not the central node of a 3-star.
9. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 8. Hence, node 3 is not the central node of a 3-star.
10. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9. Hence, node 0 is not the central node of a 3-star.

Counting the number of 3-stars found: [5]. 
Unique 3-stars: <<5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>>.
