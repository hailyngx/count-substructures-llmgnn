Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <9, (5, 6, 3)>
- <6, (9, 5, 1)>
- <4, (5, 8, 0)>
- <8, (4, 7, 1)>
- <2, (6, 4, 7)>
- <0, (9, 4, 7)>
- <7, (8, 2, 3)>
- <1, (9, 6, 8)>
- <3, (9, 6, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [9].
