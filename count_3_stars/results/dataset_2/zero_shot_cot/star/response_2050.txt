Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 7) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5, as node 5 is one of the nodes mentioned in the question. The nodes connected to node 5 are 9, 13, 7, and 14.

Next, let's look at these connected nodes and check if there are any 3-stars centered at any of them.
1. For node 9: Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 0. Hence, we have a 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (5, 7, 0)>.
2. For node 13: Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 8, 12, 11, and 6. None of these combinations form a 3-star.
3. For node 7: Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 8, 12, and 11. None of these combinations form a 3-star.
4. For node 14: Node 14 is connected to nodes 5 and 0. Since it only has 2 connections, there cannot be a 3-star centered at node 14.

Therefore, there is only 1 3-star in the given graph: <9, (5, 7, 0)>.
