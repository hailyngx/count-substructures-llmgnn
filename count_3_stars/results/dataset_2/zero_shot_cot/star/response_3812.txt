Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the 3-star graphs in the given graph, we'll look for patterns where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star pattern. 

Let's list the 3-star patterns:
<5, (0, 8, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 2)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<0, (5, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (9, 7, -)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (9, 3, 2)>

As we can see, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
