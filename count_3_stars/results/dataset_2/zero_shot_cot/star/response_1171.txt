Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the 3-stars found in this graph:

<5, (8, 1, 4)>
<9, (4, 2, 3)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (9, 1, 2)>
<6, (4, 1, 2)>
<2, (9, 7, 3)>
<8, (5, 1, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 7)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
