Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. This corresponds to the definition of a 3-star.

Nodes with 3 edges: (2, 6, 8)

Next, we'll list all possible 3-stars using these nodes:

<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<6, (7, 3, 8)>

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
