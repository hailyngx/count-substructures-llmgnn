Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 14) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in each potential 3-star:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 12
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 11
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 11, and 12
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 12
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 9, 10, and 11

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars using the information provided:

- Node 1: (0, 2, 3), (0, 2, 12), (0, 3, 12), (2, 3, 12) = 4 3-stars
- Node 3: (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 7), (1, 4, 7), (2, 4, 7) = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: (9, 10, 11) = 1 3-star
- Node 8: (4, 7, 11), (4, 7, 12), (4, 11, 12), (7, 11, 12) = 4 3-stars
- Node 13: (5, 8, 12) = 1 3-star
- Node 14: (9, 10, 11), (9, 10, 14), (9, 11, 14), (10, 11, 14) = 4 3-stars

Finally, summing up the 3-stars from each central node: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (0, 2, 3)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 12)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 12)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 12)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 7)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<3, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<6, (9, 10, 11)>, 
<8, (4, 7, 11)>, 
<8, (4, 7, 12)>, 
<8, (4, 11, 12)>, 
<8, (7, 11, 12)>, 
<13, (5, 8, 12)>, 
<14, (9, 10, 11)>, 
<14, (9, 10, 14)>, 
<14, (9, 11, 14)>, 
<14, (10, 11, 14)>.
