Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 9) (13, 15) (4, 9) (4, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 6) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 10) (19, 16) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 12) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 9) (6, 18) (6, 11) (10, 19) (10, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (15, 16, 8)>
<15, (3, 18, 13)>
<14, (17, 11, 12)>
<17, (14, 0, 5)>
<1, (8, 7, 3)>
<8, (3, 1, 9)>
<13, (15, 8, 0)>
<4, (9, 0, 0)>
<2, (5, 7, 2)>
<18, (15, 11, 6)>
<5, (17, 2, 19)>
<19, (14, 5, 11)>
<9, (8, 4, 12)>
<11, (14, 18, 19)>
<12, (14, 9, 16)>
<16, (3, 5, 19)>
<0, (17, 4, 9)>
<6, (18, 11, 6)>
<10, (19, 7, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 10)>

There are a total of 20 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [20].
