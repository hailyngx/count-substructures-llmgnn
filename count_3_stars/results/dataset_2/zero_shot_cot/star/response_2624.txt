Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 0) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 11) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 18) (19, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 0) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 11) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <1, (3, 17, 18)>
2. <3, (1, 10, 13)>
3. <6, (2, 12, 14)>
4. <9, (12, 12, 13)>
5. <10, (3, 14, 15)>
6. <11, (5, 8, 19)>
7. <12, (4, 6, 9)>
8. <13, (0, 3, 9)>
9. <14, (6, 10, 15)>
10. <15, (5, 10, 14)>
11. <16, (14, 17, 17)>
12. <17, (0, 1, 16)>
13. <18, (0, 1, 8)>
14. <0, (13, 17, 18)>
15. <5, (4, 11, 15)>


There are a total of 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
