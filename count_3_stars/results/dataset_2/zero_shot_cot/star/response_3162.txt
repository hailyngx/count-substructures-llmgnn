Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 5:
   - (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 7)
   - <5, (9, 1, 4)>
   - <5, (9, 1, 0)>
   - <5, (9, 1, 7)>
   - <5, (1, 9, 7)>
   [4]

2. Node 9:
   - (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7)
   - <9, (5, 2, 3)>
   - <9, (5, 2, 1)>
   - <9, (5, 3, 1)>
   - <9, (2, 5, 1)>
   [4]

3. Node 1:
   - (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 7)
   [No 3-star with 1 as the center]

4. Node 3:
   - (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 2)
   - <3, (9, 6, 2)>
   [1]

5. Node 4:
   - (4, 5), (4, 0)
   [No 3-star with 4 as the center]

6. Node 8:
   - (8, 2), (8, 7), (8, 6)
   [No 3-star with 8 as the center]

7. Node 2:
   - (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 6), (2, 0)
   - <2, (9, 3, 8)>
   - <2, (9, 6, 0)>
   [2]

8. Node 0:
   - (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 2), (0, 7)
   - <0, (5, 4, 2)>
   - <0, (5, 2, 7)>
   [2]

9. Node 7:
   - (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 6)
   - <7, (5, 9, 1)>
   - <7, (5, 0, 6)>
   [2]

10. Node 6:
   - (6, 3), (6, 8), (6, 2), (6, 7)
   [No 3-star with 6 as the center]

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
