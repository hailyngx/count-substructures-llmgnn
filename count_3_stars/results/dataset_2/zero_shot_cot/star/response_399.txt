Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 24) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 18) (27, 28) (27, 8) (1, 26) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 19) (3, 12) (20, 7) (20, 19) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 15) (26, 25) (2, 26) (2, 16) (2, 4) (8, 27) (8, 5) (8, 11) (19, 3) (19, 20) (4, 2) (4, 28) (18, 27) (18, 23) (7, 20) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 22) (7, 9) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 15) (28, 27) (28, 4) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 15) (22, 7) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 29) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 21) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 10) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 6) (13, 1) (13, 21) (13, 29) (13, 6) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 13) (21, 5) (5, 8) (5, 21) (16, 2) (16, 22) (6, 7) (6, 22) (6, 15) (6, 13) (14, 1) (23, 18) (23, 9) (12, 3) (12, 17) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 23) (10, 3) (10, 24) (29, 22) (29, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are forming 3-stars by checking nodes with exactly three edges.

The nodes with three edges are:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 6
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 9
- Node 11
- Node 13
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 17
- Node 18
- Node 21
- Node 22
- Node 24
- Node 25
- Node 26
- Node 27
- Node 28
- Node 29

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (27, 21, 24)>
<27, (0, 24, 18)>
<1, (26, 14, 13)>
<3, (10, 19, 12)>
<20, (7, 19, 25)>
<26, (1, 2, 15)>
<2, (26, 16, 4)>
<8, (27, 5, 11)>
<19, (3, 20, 25)>
<4, (2, 28, 26)>
<18, (27, 23, 18)>
<7, (20, 25, 6)>
<25, (26, 7, 17)>
<28, (27, 4, 28)>
<17, (25, 12, 15)>
<22, (7, 16, 6)>
<11, (8, 21, 24)>
<24, (0, 27, 11)>
<15, (26, 25, 17)>
<13, (1, 21, 29)>
<21, (0, 13, 5)>
<5, (8, 21, 5)>
<16, (2, 22, 16)>
<6, (7, 22, 15)>
<14, (1, 14, 13)>
<23, (18, 9, 23)>
<12, (3, 17, 12)>
<9, (0, 7, 23)>
<10, (3, 24, 10)>
<29, (22, 13, 29)>

There are a total of 30 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
