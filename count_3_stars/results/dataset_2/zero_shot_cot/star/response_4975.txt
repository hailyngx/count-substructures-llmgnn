Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (19, 16) (19, 2) (15, 8) (15, 14) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (3, 0) (17, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 15) (8, 14) (8, 18) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (5, 2, 9)>
<2, (19, 13, 5)>
<4, (17, 1, 10)>
<18, (16, 10, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
