Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 14) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (6, 10) (6, 17) (13, 5) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 12) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 15) (0, 3) (0, 15) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (9, 19) (9, 15) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 16) (1, 4) (1, 18) (14, 4) (14, 16) (14, 12) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which is a characteristic of the leaves in a 3-star. Then, by checking the pairs of nodes connected by edges, we can identify the 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly three connections are: 4, 6, 13, 7, 0, 2, 1, 17, 16, 9, 18, and 15.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- From node 4: <4, (1, 16, 14)>
- From node 6: <6, (10, 17, -)>
- From node 13: <13, (5, -, -)>
- From node 7: <7, (8, 19, 3)>
- From node 0: <0, (3, 15, -)>
- From node 2: <2, (10, 3, 16)>
- From node 1: <1, (4, 18, -)>
- From node 17: <17, (6, 16, 12)>
- From node 16: <16, (4, 17, 14)>
- From node 9: <9, (19, 15, -)>
- From node 18: <18, (15, 1, -)>
- From node 15: <15, (7, 0, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
