Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 12) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 13) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 22) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 3) (22, 7) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 28) (28, 9) (28, 23) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 26) (2, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 26) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 6) (20, 27) (20, 29) (4, 22) (4, 26) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 6) (3, 7) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 18) (25, 17) (25, 6) (25, 10) (19, 15) (19, 22) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 25) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 4) (14, 16) (14, 2) (24, 22) (10, 9) (10, 25) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Below are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<11, (16, 0, 6)>
<16, (11, 1, 14)>
<5, (18, 0, -)>
<9, (28, 10, 12)>
<15, (27, 19, 26)>
<27, (15, 20, 13)>
<7, (15, 21, 3)>
<21, (15, 7, 3)>
<22, (7, 19, 4)>
<23, (2, 28, -)>
<28, (9, 23, 29)>
<29, (28, 20, 26)>
<2, (23, 8, 1)>
<8, (11, 2, 26)>
<17, (2, 13, 25)>
<20, (27, 29, -)>
<4, (22, 26, -)>
<13, (27, 17, 6)>
<3, (7, 21, 0)>
<25, (17, 6, 10)>
<19, (15, 22, -)>
<6, (11, 17, 13)>
<1, (16, 2, 18)>
(12, 9, -)

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
