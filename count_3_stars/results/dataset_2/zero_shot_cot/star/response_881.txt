Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to first identify all the 3-stars by finding central nodes connected to exactly three leaves.

Let's identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 2, 10)>
<4, (12, 13, 0)>
<8, (6, 5, 12)>
<5, (6, 8, 12)>
<3, (4, 11, 13)>
<11, (6, 3, 14)>
<12, (4, 8, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 14)>
<14, (11, 12, 1)>
<7, (9, 2, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 7)>
<13, (4, 3, 10)>
<0, (4, 11, 12)>
<10, (9, 1, 14)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
