Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 5) (14, 0) (14, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 10) (17, 0) (17, 3) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 15) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 18) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 0) (18, 16) (18, 11) (15, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<6, (5, 9, 13)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<4, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, 16)>
<12, (4, 15, 11)>
<4, (9, 11, 12)>
<13, (5, 10, 13)>
<16, (1, 7, 19)>
<8, (2, 11, 19)>
<14, (0, 3, 17)>
<0, (5, 14, 17)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (10, 14, 17)>
<10, (1, 3, 13)>
<18, (0, 11, 16)>
<15, (4, 11, 12)>

Now, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
