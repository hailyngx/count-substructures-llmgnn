Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 10) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
There are 6 total 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (2, 7, 13)>
<8, (1, 12, 13)>
<13, (3, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 12)>
<0, (10, 4, 14)>
