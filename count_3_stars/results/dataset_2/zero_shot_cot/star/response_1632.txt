Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern with a central node and three leaves. 

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first list all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>
<4, (8, 0, 6)>
<7, (9, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (5, 4, 6)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph, we get [6].
