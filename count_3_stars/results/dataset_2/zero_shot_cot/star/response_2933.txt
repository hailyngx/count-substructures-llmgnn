Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (13, 19) (13, 6) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 7) (15, 18) (15, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (0, 18) (0, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (17, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by locating the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Central Node: 5, Leaves: 9, 8, 7
2. Central Node: 9, Leaves: 5, 8, 10
3. Central Node: 10, Leaves: 9, 11, 3
4. Central Node: 11, Leaves: 10, 7, 12
5. Central Node: 4, Leaves: 18, 19, 14
6. Central Node: 18, Leaves: 4, 15, 16
7. Central Node: 13, Leaves: 19, 6

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 10)>
<10, (9, 11, 3)>
<11, (10, 7, 12)>
<4, (18, 19, 14)>
<18, (4, 15, 16)>
<13, (19, 6)>

Finally, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
