Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 15) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 6) (5, 6) (5, 16) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (9, 4) (9, 11) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 12) (4, 19) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 3) (12, 15) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 14) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 10) (16, 5) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 10, and 18:
   <1, (2, 10, 18)>

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 10, and 16:
   <3, (2, 10, 16)>

3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 18:
   <7, (11, 14, 18)>

4. Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 15:
   <10, (1, 3, 15)>

5. Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 13:
   <15, (7, 10, 13)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars found: [5].
