Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 14) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 16) (6, 0) (6, 29) (6, 13) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 12) (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 7) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 20) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (4, 27) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 20) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 16) (20, 10) (20, 4) (20, 23) (24, 8) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 23) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 29) (19, 29) (19, 23) (23, 5) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 19) (1, 25) (1, 28) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 28) (25, 1) (25, 12) (29, 15) (29, 6) (29, 21) (29, 19) (16, 27) (16, 8) (18, 12) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 2) (28, 13) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 4) (14, 13) (7, 5) (7, 10) (11, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 25) (12, 18) (12, 11) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 3: <3, (15, 2, 12)>
- From node 15: <15, (3, 29, 14)>
- From node 27: <27, (0, 4, 16)>
- From node 6: <6, (0, 29, 13)>
- From node 9: <9, (0, 5, 28)>
- From node 17: <17, (10, 2, 4)>
- From node 4: <4, (27, 17, 8)>
- From node 20: <20, (10, 4, 23)>
- From node 8: <8, (4, 24, 16)>
- From node 10: <10, (17, 21, 7)>
- From node 24: <24, (8, 26, 16)>
- From node 26: <26, (24, 23, 8)>
- From node 21: <21, (0, 10, 29)>
- From node 19: <19, (29, 23, 19)>
- From node 1: <1, (25, 28, 12)>
- From node 25: <25, (1, 12, 25)>
- From node 16: <16, (27, 8, 16)>
- From node 18: <18, (12, 18, 11)>
- From node 7: <7, (5, 10, 7)>
- From node 11: <11, (12, 18, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
