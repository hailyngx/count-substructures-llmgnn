Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes in the given graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

Next, let's find the adjacent nodes for each node based on the edges provided:

Node 0: 10, 8, 4
Node 1: 6, 9, 7, 12, 14
Node 2: 6, 10, 11, 8, 13, 4
Node 3: 12, 5, 4
Node 4: 2, 0, 3, 5
Node 5: 11, 14, 3, 4
Node 6: 1, 2, 11, 13
Node 7: 8, 13, 1
Node 8: 10, 7, 12, 2, 0
Node 9: 14, 1, 13
Node 10: 11, 0, 8, 2
Node 11: 6, 10, 5, 2
Node 12: 14, 3, 1, 8
Node 13: 6, 9, 7, 2
Node 14: 9, 12, 1, 5

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[5]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 9, 14)>
<2, (6, 10, 13)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 5, 14)>
<13, (6, 7, 13)>
