Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars and list them, we need to identify the unique central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. From the given edges, identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 2.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 4.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 0. (Node 7 does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only two nodes.)

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 1, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<8, (6, 1, 4)>
<2, (5, 1, 4)>
<0, (9, 1, 4)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars:
