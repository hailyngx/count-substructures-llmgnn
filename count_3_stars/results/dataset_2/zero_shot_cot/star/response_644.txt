Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 3, 0)>
<4, (13, 6, 0)>
<7, (9, 12, 6)>
<10, (6, 13, 8)>
<11, (9, 13, 2)>
<12, (7, 14, 8)>
