Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars (with unique combinations of nodes):
<1, (2, 3, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
