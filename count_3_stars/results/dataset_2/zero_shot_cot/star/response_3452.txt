This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 4) (4, 16) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 9) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 17) (18, 8) (22, 2) (5, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (5, 20) (13, 11) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 17) (26, 24) (26, 20) (26, 25) (26, 6) (28, 4) (28, 2) (8, 18) (8, 21) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 19) (10, 27) (15, 4) (15, 6) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 25) (21, 2) (2, 11) (2, 22) (2, 28) (2, 21) (2, 0) (17, 18) (17, 24) (17, 19) (17, 27) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 29) (6, 24) (6, 26) (6, 15) (6, 3) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 3) (19, 12) (23, 18) (23, 5) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 20) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 20) (20, 5) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 1) (0, 21) (0, 2) (0, 12) (27, 10) (27, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 0) (29, 11) (29, 5) (29, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify nodes with degree = 3 to find potential center nodes:
   - Node 11 has degree 5
   - Node 16 has degree 3
   - Node 4 has degree 5
   - Node 7 has degree 4
   - Node 18 has degree 4
   - Node 5 has degree 4
   - Node 13 has degree 2
   - Node 24 has degree 3
   - Node 26 has degree 4
   - Node 28 has degree 2
   - Node 8 has degree 2
   - Node 9 has degree 3
   - Node 15 has degree 2
   - Node 21 has degree 4
   - Node 2 has degree 5
   - Node 17 has degree 4
   - Node 25 has degree 4
   - Node 6 has degree 4
   - Node 19 has degree 4
   - Node 23 has degree 2
   - Node 3 has degree 3
   - Node 1 has degree 2
   - Node 20 has degree 4
   - Node 0 has degree 3
   - Node 27 has degree 3
   - Node 12 has degree 3
   - Node 29 has degree 3

2. Now, we look for 3-stars by considering each potential center node and its neighboring nodes:
   - For Node 16, a 3-star can be formed with (16, 7, 4, 1) or (16, 7, 9, 18).
   - For Node 24, a 3-star can be formed with (24, 26, 6, 15).
   - For Node 0, a 3-star can be formed with (0, 21, 8, 18).

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have:
<16, (7, 4, 1)>, <16, (7, 9, 18)>, <24, (26, 6, 15)>, <0, (21, 8, 18)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
