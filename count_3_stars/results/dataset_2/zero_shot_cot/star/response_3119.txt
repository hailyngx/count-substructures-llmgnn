Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 8) (12, 27) (12, 8) (27, 12) (27, 2) (27, 13) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 7) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 21) (19, 3) (19, 0) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 23) (22, 19) (22, 17) (13, 27) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 23) (17, 6) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 15) (20, 17) (20, 29) (24, 26) (24, 18) (24, 23) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 25) (8, 3) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 14) (29, 20) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 18) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 4) (23, 26) (23, 13) (23, 24) (23, 16) (7, 28) (7, 29) (7, 5) (0, 19) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 10) (2, 27) (2, 1) (14, 15) (21, 19) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 1) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 23) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 4) (18, 24) (18, 29) (18, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all unique 3-stars.

Let's go through the list of nodes and their connections to find the 3-stars:

1. The central node in a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes.

By looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <6, (28, 1, 17)>
- <27, (12, 2, 13)>
- <26, (19, 13, 24)>
- <17, (6, 28, 22)>
- <20, (17, 29, 15)>
- <29, (20, 7, 25)>
- <11, (28, 1, 4)>
- <1, (6, 11, 25)>
- <23, (26, 13, 24)>
- <13, (27, 26, 16)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
