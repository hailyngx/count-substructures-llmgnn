Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, forming a star-like shape.

Given the graph, let's identify the 3-stars:
1. <0, (7, 1, 3)>
2. <1, (5, 7, 3)>
3. <2, (9, 4, 6)>
4. <3, (5, 9, 1)>
5. <4, (9, 8, 2)>
6. <5, (8, 1, 0)>
7. <6, (7, 2, -)>
8. <7, (6, 0, 1)>
9. <8, (9, 5, 2)>
10. <9, (3, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
