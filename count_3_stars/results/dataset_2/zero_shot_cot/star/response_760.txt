Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 14) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph.
Now, let's list all the 3-stars in this graph:
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<5, (8, 0, 7)>
<9, (6, 13, 12)>
<6, (3, 13, 4)>
<4, (7, 1, 13)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<13, (6, 10, 3)>
<8, (11, 0, 1)>
<0, (10, 2, 5)>
<10, (2, 3, 13)>
<2, (0, 12, 10)>
<12, (14, 2, 9)>
<11, (0, 8, 1)>
<14, (12, 3, 4)>
<3, (14, 10, 6)>

Now, count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
