Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes to form 3-stars. 

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 2
2. Node 1: Connected to nodes 9, 6, 8
3. Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 4, 6
4. Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 3
5. Node 5: Connected to nodes 2, 8, 0
6. Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 1
7. Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 2
8. Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 4, 1

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (5, 7, 2)>
2. <1, (9, 6, 8)>
3. <3, (5, 4, 6)>
4. <4, (9, 7, 3)>
5. <5, (2, 8, 0)>
6. <6, (9, 7, 1)>
7. <8, (5, 7, 2)>
8. <9, (6, 4, 1)>

Therefore, there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
