Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can analyze each node in the graph to determine if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<1, (7, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 2)>
<6, (7, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 2)>
<9, (7, 0, 1)>

Counting the 3-stars, we have found a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
