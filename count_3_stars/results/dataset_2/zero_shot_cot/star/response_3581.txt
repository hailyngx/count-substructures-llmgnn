Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5.

Next, moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8.

Moving on to node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 9.

Next, looking at node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8, and 9.

Continuing to node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.

Next, checking node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.

Moving on to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.

Next, checking node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Moving on to node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.

Finally, looking at node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 6, 7, and 2.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[There are 11 3-stars in this graph.]

<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 4)>
<5, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<(0, 1, 3), 7>
