Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (17, 19) (17, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 18) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 15) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (15, 14) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 5) (12, 19) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 12) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (19, 17) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (10, 5, 12)>
<1, (2, 6, 17)>
<2, (1, 4, 15)>
<3, (5, 7, 18)>
<4, (2, 11, 16)>
<5, (0, 3, 15)>
<6, (1, 7, 11)>
<7, (3, 6, 15)>
<8, (9, 10, 18)>
<9, (8, 14, 19)>
<10, (0, 2, 19)>
<11, (4, 6, 16)>
<12, (5, 19, 0)>
<14, (9, 15, 19)>
<15, (2, 5, 7)>
<16, (3, 4, 18)>
<17, (1, 7, 19)>
<18, (3, 8, 16)>
<19, (10, 14, 17)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
