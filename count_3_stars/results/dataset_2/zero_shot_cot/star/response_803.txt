Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 22) (5, 12) (9, 8) (9, 13) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 6) (27, 7) (27, 6) (27, 8) (22, 16) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 29) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 3) (28, 11) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 25) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 2) (6, 0) (6, 27) (6, 21) (6, 4) (21, 6) (18, 26) (18, 7) (18, 1) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 25) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 17) (20, 29) (20, 12) (29, 22) (29, 20) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 12) (3, 23) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 2) (4, 22) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 19) (12, 17) (7, 27) (7, 18) (7, 13) (17, 15) (17, 19) (17, 12) (24, 3) (2, 26) (2, 15) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (1, 18) (1, 25) (25, 28) (25, 10) (25, 14) (25, 1) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all the nodes that are connected with exactly three edges to form 3-stars. Let's list them:

1. Node 0 (connected to 11, 26, 6)
2. Node 2 (connected to 26, 15, 4)
3. Node 3 (connected to 23, 28, 24)
4. Node 4 (connected to 22, 6, 2)
5. Node 8 (connected to 9, 27, 19)
6. Node 10 (connected to 15, 13, 25)
7. Node 12 (connected to 5, 20, 19)
8. Node 17 (connected to 15, 19, 12)
9. Node 22 (connected to 16, 23, 29)
10. Node 26 (connected to 0, 23, 28)
11. Node 27 (connected to 7, 6, 8)
12. Node 28 (connected to 11, 26, 25)

Next, we will find the 3-star structures:

<0, (11, 26, 6)>
<2, (26, 15, 4)>
<3, (23, 28, 24)>
<4, (22, 6, 2)>
<8, (9, 27, 19)>
<10, (15, 13, 25)>
<12, (5, 20, 19)>
<17, (15, 19, 12)>
<22, (16, 23, 29)>
<26, (0, 23, 28)>
<27, (7, 6, 8)>
<28, (11, 26, 25)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars: [12]
