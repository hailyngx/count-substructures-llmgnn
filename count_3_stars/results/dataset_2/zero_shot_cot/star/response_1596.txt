Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 24) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 28) (27, 1) (27, 13) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 16) (2, 1) (2, 15) (18, 27) (18, 20) (15, 0) (15, 2) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 16) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 29) (28, 27) (28, 26) (28, 4) (1, 27) (1, 2) (17, 12) (17, 22) (17, 11) (26, 28) (26, 6) (26, 4) (3, 21) (3, 19) (29, 20) (29, 13) (9, 15) (9, 24) (5, 10) (10, 5) (10, 25) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 25) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 19) (6, 26) (6, 24) (24, 0) (24, 9) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 19) (16, 21) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 23) (22, 17) (22, 14) (22, 25) (22, 8) (8, 22) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 23) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 16) (13, 12) (4, 28) (4, 26) (4, 23) (23, 16) (23, 12) (23, 4) (23, 19) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 24) (19, 23) (19, 25) (25, 10) (25, 11) (25, 22) (25, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify all the possible 3-stars by checking each node's connections as described in the graph's edges.

1. Node 0:
- <0, (27, 15, 24)>
  
2. Node 27:
- <27, (0, 18, 28)>
- <27, (1, 13, 29)>
  
3. Node 7:
- No 3-stars as it has only one connection.

4. Node 21:
- <21, (7, 3, 16)>
- <21, (7, 16, 21)> (Duplicate, so count only once)

5. Node 2:
- No 3-stars as it has only two connections.
  
6. Node 18:
- <18, (27, 20, 15)>
- <18, (27, 20, 15)> (Duplicate, so count only once)
  
7. Node 15:
- No 3-stars as it has four connections.
  
8. Node 20:
- <20, (18, 29, 15)>
- <20, (18, 29, 15)> (Duplicate, so count only once)
  
9. Node 28:
- No 3-stars as it has three connections.
  
10. Node 1:
- No 3-stars as it has two connections.
  
11. Node 17:
- No 3-stars as it has three connections.
  
12. Node 26:
- No 3-stars as it has three connections.
  
13. Node 3:
- No 3-stars as it has two connections.

14. Node 29:
- No 3-stars as it has two connections.

15. Node 9:
- No 3-stars as it has two connections.

16. Node 5:
- No 3-stars as it has two connections.

17. Node 10:
- No 3-stars as it has two connections.

18. Node 11:
- No 3-stars as it has four connections.

19. Node 14:
- No 3-stars as it has three connections.

20. Node 6:
- No 3-stars as it has two connections.

21. Node 24:
- <24, (0, 9, 6)>
- <24, (0, 11, 19)>
- <24, (6, 11, 19)>
- <24, (19, 3, 24)>
- <24, (19, 14, 24)> (Duplicate, so count only once)
  
22. Node 16:
- <16, (21, 15, 13)>
- <16, (21, 15, 23)>
- <16, (21, 13, 16)>
- <16, (21, 16, 23)> (Duplicate, so count only once)

23. Node 22:
- No 3-stars as it has four connections.

24. Node 8:
- No 3-stars as it has one connection.

25. Node 12:
- No 3-stars as it has three connections.

26. Node 13:
- No 3-stars as it has four connections.

27. Node 4:
- No 3-stars as it has three connections.

28. Node 23:
- No 3-stars as it has four connections.

29. Node 19:
- No 3-stars as it has five connections.

30. Node 25:
- No 3-stars as it has four connections.

Thus, in total, there are [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
