Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors. 

1. Node 6 has neighbors 1, 2, and 4. <6, (1, 2, 4)>
2. Node 9 has neighbors 8, 4, and 0. <9, (8, 4, 0)>
3. Node 1 has neighbors 6, 3, and 5. <1, (6, 3, 5)>
4. Node 3 has neighbors 1, 7, and 5. <3, (1, 7, 5)>
5. Node 5 has neighbors 1, 3, and 8. <5, (1, 3, 8)>
6. Node 0 has neighbors 9, 3, and 2. <0, (9, 3, 2)>
7. Node 2 has neighbors 6, 0, and 8. <2, (6, 0, 8)>
8. Node 8 has neighbors 9, 5, and 2. <8, (9, 5, 2)>
9. Node 7 has neighbors 1, 3, and 2. <7, (1, 3, 2)>
10. Node 4 has neighbors 6, 9, and 1. <4, (6, 9, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
