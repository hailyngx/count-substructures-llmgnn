Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the relevant structures. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph: 
<4, (7, 14, 13)>
<7, (4, 3, 9)>
<0, (8, 1, 6)>
<14, (4, 3, 2)>
<5, (12, 1, 11)>
<13, (4, 14, 11)>
<3, (7, 14, 11)>
<11, (4, 5, 13)>
<12, (4, 5, 10)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 0, 1)>
<2, (14, 11, 9)>
<9, (7, 3, 12)>
<10, (13, 3, 12)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 14 unique 3-stars as listed above. 

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
