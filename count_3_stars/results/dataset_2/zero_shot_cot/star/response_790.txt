Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 12) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 17) (18, 9) (18, 2) (18, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 9) (8, 19) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 14) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 14) (0, 10) (16, 4) (16, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 19) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 10) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

We will first identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Based on the list of edges, we identify the nodes with the following connections:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 15, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 16.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 16.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 18.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 11, and 15.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 15, 14)>
<9, (5, 8, 18)>
<4, (7, 13, 16)>
<3, (1, 11, 16)>
<2, (12, 18, 3)>
<14, (5, 11, 15)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
