Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 1) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 25) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 29) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 2) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 27) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 5) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 8) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 19) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 27) (4, 5) (27, 10) (27, 20) (27, 4) (21, 6) (21, 18) (7, 9) (7, 28) (7, 24) (7, 8) (16, 19) (3, 12) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (12, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 4) (23, 17) (29, 6) (29, 10) (29, 26) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 25) (18, 11) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 25) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 7) (24, 1) (1, 22) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 24) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 18) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node in the graph to find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 15), (0, 2), (0, 1)
   <0, (15, 2, 1)>, [1]

2. Node 1: (1, 22), (1, 10), (1, 14), (1, 24)
   <1, (22, 10, 14)>, [1]
   <1, (22, 10, 24)>, [1]
   <1, (22, 14, 24)>, [1]

3. Node 2: (2, 15), (2, 0), (2, 5)
   <2, (15, 0, 5)>, [1]

4. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 15), (4, 27), (4, 5)
   <4, (9, 15, 27)>, [1]
   <4, (9, 15, 5)>, [1]
   <4, (9, 27, 5)>, [1]
   <4, (15, 27, 5)>, [1]

5. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 21), (6, 29), (6, 25)
   <6, (9, 21, 29)>, [1]

6. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 28), (7, 24), (7, 8)
   <7, (9, 28, 24)>, [1]

7. Node 8: (8, 20), (8, 11), (8, 7), (8, 25)
   <8, (20, 11, 25)>, [1]

8. Node 10: (10, 26), (10, 27), (10, 1), (10, 29)
   <10, (26, 27, 29)>, [1]

9. Node 11: (11, 14), (11, 18), (11, 8)
   <11, (14, 18, 8)>, [1]

10. Node 14: (14, 11), (14, 18), (14, 1)
   <14, (11, 18, 1)>, [1]
