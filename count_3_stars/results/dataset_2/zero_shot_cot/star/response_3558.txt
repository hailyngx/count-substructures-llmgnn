Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes (nodes with 3 edges connected to them):

- Node 9 is a central node with edges to nodes 5, 6, and 4.
- Node 4 is a central node with edges to nodes 9, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is a central node with edges to nodes 9, 4, and 3.
- Node 1 is a central node with edges to nodes 5, 9, and 7.
- Node 3 is a central node with edges to nodes 4, 7, and 1.
- Node 0 is a central node with edges to nodes 5, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is a central node with edges to nodes 9, 4, and 1.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- For central node 9: <9, (5, 6, 4)>
- For central node 4: <4, (9, 7, 8)> <4, (7, 9, 3)>
- For central node 7: <7, (9, 4, 3)>
- For central node 1: <1, (5, 9, 7)>
- For central node 3: <3, (4, 7, 1)>
- For central node 0: <0, (5, 4, 6)>
- For central node 2: <2, (9, 4, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
