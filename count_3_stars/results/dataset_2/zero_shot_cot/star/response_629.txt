Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 17) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 16) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 0) (19, 15) (19, 9) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 16) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 9) (6, 17) (6, 10) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 9) (9, 19) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<3, (8, 13, 7)>
<5, (13, 12, 7)>
<7, (8, 13, 12)>
<10, (4, 2, 6)>
<11, (2, 17, 18)>
<15, (7, 0, 19)>
<17, (4, 11, 6)>
<18, (7, 11, 0)>
<19, (15, 9, 7)>
<4, (10, 14, 17)>
<6, (10, 17, 16)>
<9, (19, 15, 14)>
<12, (13, 5, 7)>
<13, (8, 5, 12)>
<14, (4, 3, 9)>
<16, (5, 10, 6)>
<2, (10, 11, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of 16. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
