Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 8) (25, 0) (10, 21) (10, 9) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 1) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 16) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 17) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 4) (12, 27) (12, 21) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 1) (27, 5) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 6) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 24) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 3) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 4) (5, 27) (5, 26) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 22) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 24) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 14) (16, 17) (16, 18) (24, 28) (24, 3) (24, 19) (24, 0) (1, 11) (1, 29) (1, 27) (1, 7) (8, 25) (8, 6) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 7) (6, 26) (6, 8) (0, 25) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 22) (0, 9) (9, 10) (9, 0) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 0) (13, 2) (4, 29) (4, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing out all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<20, (3, 23, 28)>
<25, (8, 0, -)>
<10, (21, 9, -)>
<11, (23, 7, 1)>
<17, (29, 16, 22)>
<2, (18, 13, -)>
<18, (26, 16, -)>
<28, (20, 29, 24)>
<29, (17, 28, 1)>
<12, (27, 21, 14)>
<27, (12, 3, 1)>
<26, (18, 5, 6)>
<3, (20, 27, 21)>
<21, (10, 12, 3)>
<23, (20, 11, 4)>
<5, (27, 26, -)>
<15, (19, 0, 22)>
<19, (15, 14, 24)>
<7, (11, 1, 14)>
<16, (17, 18, -)>
<24, (28, 3, 19)>
<1, (11, 29, 27)>
<8, (25, 6, -)>
<14, (12, 3, 19)>
<6, (26, 8, -)>
<0, (25, 15, 24)>
<9, (10, 0, -)>
<22, (17, 15, 0)>

There are a total of 28 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
