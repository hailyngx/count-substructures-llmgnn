Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (4, 19) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 19) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 19) (15, 17) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 0) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their respective connected nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (8, 11, 19)>
<4, (2, 19, 13)>
<7, (12, 0, 16)>
<10, (1, 13, 19)>
<12, (7, 0, 16)>
<15, (17, 8, 3)>
<18, (11, 6, 3)>
<0, (14, 16, 19)>
<5, (9, 16, 5)>
<9, (5, 13, 9)>
<14, (16, 0, 17)>
<17, (14, 15, 3)>
<2, (4, 8, 13)>
<8, (17, 1, 2)>
<19, (1, 10, 4)>
<11, (18, 1, 3)>
<16, (14, 0, 5)>
<6, (14, 18, 3)>
<3, (17, 8, 6)>
<13, (9, 2, 10)>

Counting them, we find a total of [20] 3-stars in the graph.
