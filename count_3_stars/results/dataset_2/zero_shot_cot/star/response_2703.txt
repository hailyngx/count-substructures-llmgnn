Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 15) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 3) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 14) (19, 2) (2, 19) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <6, (9, 8, 13)>
2. <10, (16, 17, 5)>
3. <17, (10, 0, 18)>
4. <14, (11, 8, 15)>
5. <5, (10, 0, 3)>
6. <2, (19, 5, 13)>
7. <0, (17, 14, 5)>
8. <4, (12, 1, 3)>
9. <18, (16, 9, 17)>
10. <3, (4, 5, 18)>
