Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 11) (6, 10) (6, 3) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 19) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (17, 1) (17, 4) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 19) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 11) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 4) (13, 16) (13, 9) (2, 15) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 16) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 3) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 4) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 19) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 0) (19, 4) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 11) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 16) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
   - (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 18), (0, 19)

2. Node 1:
   - (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 9), (1, 17)

3. Node 2:
   - (2, 3), (2, 15)

4. Node 3:
   - (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 16)

5. Node 4:
   - (4, 0), (4, 10), (4, 14), (4, 17), (4, 19)

6. Node 5:
   - (5, 11), (5, 18)

7. Node 6:
   - (6, 3), (6, 10)

8. Node 7:
   - (7, 8), (7, 12), (7, 19)

9. Node 8:
   - (8, 7), (8, 12), (8, 14), (8, 16)

10. Node 9:
    - (9, 1), (9, 11), (9, 13)

11. Node 10:
    - (10, 4), (10, 6), (10, 15)

12. Node 11:
    - (11, 5), (11, 9), (11, 15)

13. Node 12:
    - (12, 7), (12, 8), (12, 19)

14. Node 13:
    - (13, 9), (13, 16)

15. Node 14:
    - (14, 4), (14, 8), (14, 18)

16. Node 15:
    - (15, 2), (15, 10), (15, 11)

17. Node 16:
    - (16, 3), (16, 8), (16, 13)

18. Node 17:
    - (17, 1), (17, 4)

19. Node 18:
    - (18, 0), (18, 5), (18, 14)

20. Node 19:
    - (19, 0), (19, 4), (19, 7), (19, 12)

Now, counting the number of 3-stars in this graph: [<0, (1, 4, 18)>, <0, (1, 4, 19)>, <0, (18, 5, 14)>, <1, (4, 17, 19)>, <2, (3, 6, 16)>, <4, (10, 14, 18)>, <7, (8, 12, 19)>] 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
