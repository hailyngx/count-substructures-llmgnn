Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 7) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph where the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Central node 5:
   - Leaves: 9, 4, 0
   - <5, (9, 4, 0)>

2. Central node 9:
   - Leaves: 5, 8, 10
   - <9, (5, 8, 10)>

3. Central node 4:
   - Leaves: 5, 1, 13
   - <4, (5, 1, 13)>

4. Central node 0:
   - Leaves: 5, 1, 13
   - <0, (5, 1, 13)>

5. Central node 6:
   - Leaves: 10, 3, 8
   - <6, (10, 3, 8)>

6. Central node 1:
   - Leaves: 9, 3, 4
   - <1, (9, 3, 4)>

7. Central node 3:
   - Leaves: 6, 1, 12
   - <3, (6, 1, 12)>

8. Central node 8:
   - Leaves: 9, 6, 4
   - <8, (9, 6, 4)>

9. Central node 2:
   - Leaves: 1, 8, 12
   - <2, (1, 8, 12)>

10. Central node 13:
   - Leaves: 4, 11, 10
   - <13, (4, 11, 10)>

11. Central node 7:
   - Leaves: 11, 10, 14
   - <7, (11, 10, 14)>

12. Central node 12:
   - Leaves: 3, 2, 14
   - <12, (3, 2, 14)>

13. Central node 11:
   - Leaves: 5, 13, 7
   - <11, (5, 13, 7)>

14. Central node 14:
   - Leaves: 2, 7, 12
   - <14, (2, 7, 12)>

There are a total of 14 unique 3-stars in the graph. The final answer is [14].
