Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

By examining the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<1, (9, 5, 6)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 2)>
<2, (6, 8, 7)>
<0, (4, 2, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
