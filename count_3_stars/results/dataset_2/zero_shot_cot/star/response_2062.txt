Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 26) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 23) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 5) (7, 2) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 28) (21, 7) (4, 7) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 25) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 19) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 17) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 0) (20, 1) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 24) (18, 28) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 1) (22, 6) (26, 6) (26, 25) (26, 17) (3, 9) (3, 13) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 12) (15, 23) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 23) (19, 25) (1, 20) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 27) (11, 1) (11, 12) (13, 3) (13, 28) (13, 27) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 19) (16, 17) (16, 10) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 12) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 28) (5, 29) (5, 18) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 16) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 17) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 13) (28, 27) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes with degree 3 are: 6, 2, 29, 7, 21, 4, 14, 3, 24, 15, 1, 11, 13, 5, 10, 12, 16, 27, 28. 

Next, check for 3-stars around each potential center:

- Around node 6: None (since a 3-star requires exactly 3 edges).
- Around node 2: <2, (29, 20, 7)>.
- Around node 29: None (degree is 2, so not a center).
- Around node 7: <7, (2, 21, 4)>, <7, (21, 4, 28)>.
- Around node 21: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 4: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 14: <14, (9, 4, 1)>.
- Around node 3: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 24: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 15: None (degree is 3, but already counted above).
- Around node 1: <1, (20, 14, 11)>.
- Around node 11: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 13: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 5: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 10: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 12: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 16: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 27: None (degree is 2).
- Around node 28: None (degree is 2).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <2, (29, 20, 7)>, <7, (2, 21, 4)>, <7, (21, 4, 28)>, <14, (9, 4, 1)>, <1, (20, 14, 11)>.
