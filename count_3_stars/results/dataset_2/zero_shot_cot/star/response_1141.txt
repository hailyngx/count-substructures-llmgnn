Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars can be determined by finding all occurrences where a node has exactly 3 edges connected to it. Let's list the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them:

- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 4)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 3)
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 4)
- Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 0)
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 4)
- Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 0)
- Node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 4)
- Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 0)
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 0)

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (6, 5, 3)>
<6, (1, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<3, (9, 1, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 4)>
<8, (5, 6, 0)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (6, 2, 0)>
<4, (5, 6, 1)>

Therefore, there are [9] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
