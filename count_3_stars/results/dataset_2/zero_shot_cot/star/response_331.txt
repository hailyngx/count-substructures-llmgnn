Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 17) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 25) (29, 6) (10, 21) (10, 15) (11, 8) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 9) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 5) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 3) (4, 2) (4, 20) (4, 28) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 24) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 23) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 10) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 6) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 19) (22, 3) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 23) (8, 11) (8, 5) (28, 0) (28, 4) (28, 7) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 29) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 25) (24, 19) (24, 7) (25, 2) (25, 14) (17, 21) (17, 18) (17, 12) (13, 20) (13, 6) (13, 3) (3, 26) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes with exactly three edges. Then, we will count the number of unique 3-stars present.

1. Node 1: <1, (21, 15, 22)>
2. Node 22: <22, (21, 19, 3)>
3. Node 20: <20, (2, 4, 5)>
4. Node 26: <26, (19, 23, 3)>
5. Node 7: <7, (0, 12, 24)>
6. Node 6: <6, (29, 16, 14)>
7. Node 9: <9, (0, 18, 23)>
8. Node 8: <8, (11, 5, 25)>
9. Node 17: <17, (21, 18, 12)>
10. Node 13: <13, (20, 6, 3)>
11. Node 28: <28, (0, 4, 7)>
12. Node 16: <16, (0, 14, 6)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: [12].
