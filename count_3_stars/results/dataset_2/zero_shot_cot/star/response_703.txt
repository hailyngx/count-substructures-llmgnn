Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 17) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 14) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 25) (12, 11) (27, 4) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 17) (17, 21) (17, 27) (17, 0) (29, 22) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 26) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 22) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 16) (9, 14) (9, 15) (9, 11) (22, 29) (22, 8) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 9) (11, 28) (11, 5) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 2) (26, 13) (26, 6) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 5) (15, 9) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 13) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 5) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 28) (5, 25) (20, 16) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 16) (6, 26) (6, 10) (6, 18) (24, 7) (24, 10) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 6) (25, 12) (25, 5) (16, 14) (16, 20) (16, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step.

1. Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes: 23, 19, 12. 
   <1, (23, 19, 12)>

2. Node 21 is connected to 3 nodes: 3, 23, 17. 
   <21, (3, 23, 17)>

3. Node 4 is connected to 4 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

4. Node 7 is connected to 4 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

5. Node 12 is connected to 4 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

6. Node 27 is connected to 4 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

7. Node 17 is connected to 3 nodes: 21, 27, 0. 
   <17, (21, 27, 0)>

8. Node 29 is connected to 1 node, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

9. Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes: 4, 8, 26. 
   <2, (4, 8, 26)>

10. Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 19, 22.
    <8, (2, 19, 22)>

11. Node 0 is connected to 4 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

12. Node 14 is connected to 5 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

13. Node 9 is connected to 3 nodes: 14, 15, 11. 
    <9, (14, 15, 11)>

14. Node 22 is connected to 2 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

15. Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes: 21, 27, 0. 
    <3, (21, 27, 0)>

16. Node 11 is connected to 4 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

17. Node 13 is connected to 3 nodes: 26, 19, 26. 
    <13, (26, 19, 13)>

18. Node 26 is connected to 3 nodes: 2, 13, 6. 
    <26, (2, 13, 6)>

19. Node 10 is connected to 4 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

20. Node 15 is connected to 3 nodes: 9, 11, 28. 
    <15, (9, 11, 28)>

21. Node 28 is connected to 3 nodes: 11, 18, 5. 
    <28, (11, 18, 5)>

22. Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

23. Node 20 is connected to 3 nodes: 16, 14, 23.
    <20, (16, 14, 23)>

Analyzing all the connections, we find that we have 9 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
