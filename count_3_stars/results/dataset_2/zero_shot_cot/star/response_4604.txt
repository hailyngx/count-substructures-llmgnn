Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of 3 nodes where one is connected to the other two nodes directly. In this case, we are looking for sets of 4 nodes where 3 nodes are connected to the central node.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

- <5, (9, 0, 3)>
- <9, (5, 0, 10)>
- <6, (14, 7, 8)>
- <1, (11, 13, 12)>
- <11, (5, 1, 3)>
- <4, (8, 13, 11)>
- <8, (6, 4, 14)>
- <7, (6, 3, 0)>
- <12, (1, 10, 8)>
- <2, (6, 7, not connected)>
- <0, (5, 9, 7)>
- <14, (5, 9, 6)>
- <13, (9, 1, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
