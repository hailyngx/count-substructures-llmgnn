Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. 
These central nodes will be the ones with a degree of 3 in the graph.

The nodes with a degree of 3 are: 5, 9, 2, 1, 6

Now let's construct the 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<6, (1, 7, 4)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
