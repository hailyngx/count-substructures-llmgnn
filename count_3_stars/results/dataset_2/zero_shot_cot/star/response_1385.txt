Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 3) (26, 28) (26, 3) (11, 16) (11, 23) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 19) (16, 14) (16, 27) (18, 22) (18, 17) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (12, 27) (12, 2) (12, 17) (27, 16) (27, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 20) (28, 26) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 10) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 24) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (19, 16) (19, 4) (25, 5) (25, 21) (25, 10) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 21) (2, 12) (2, 4) (24, 13) (24, 8) (15, 9) (15, 0) (0, 22) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 3) (3, 9) (3, 26) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 29) (21, 4) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 21) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 8) (10, 25) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 23) (20, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are part of a 3-star configuration. These nodes will have 3 neighbors each.
From the given edges, the nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 9 (neighbors: 8, 29, 15)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 9, 26, 18)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 11, 29, 19)
- Node 27 (neighbors: 12, 16, 8)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 26, 6, 0)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 7, 5, 24)

Now, for each of these nodes, let's count the number of 3-stars they are part of.

For node 9:
- <9, (8, 29, 15)> 

For node 3:
- <3, (9, 26, 18)>
- <3, (9, 26, 0)>

For node 16:
- <16, (11, 29, 19)>

For node 27:
- <27, (12, 16, 8)>

For node 28:
- <28, (26, 6, 0)>
- <28, (26, 6, 10)>
- <28, (26, 0, 10)>

For node 13:
- <13, (7, 5, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
