Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. (5, 9, 2)
2. (6, 3, 0)
3. (0, 14, 10)
4. (14, 4, 0)
5. (3, 7, 11)
6. (11, 1, 7)
7. (13, 5, 6)
8. (4, 14, 10)
9. (12, 8, 3)
10. (7, 10, 1)
11. (1, 4, 11)
12. (2, 7, 3)
13. (8, 12, 11)
14. (10, 1, 7)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [14].
