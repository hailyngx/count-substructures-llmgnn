Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 23) (26, 15) (26, 17) (15, 26) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 28) (27, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (20, 18) (20, 19) (20, 24) (25, 13) (25, 19) (25, 11) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 28) (8, 14) (8, 22) (17, 26) (17, 5) (17, 21) (29, 7) (29, 10) (1, 28) (1, 12) (19, 20) (19, 25) (19, 23) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 10) (22, 2) (22, 8) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 28) (14, 8) (14, 24) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 24) (3, 18) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 3) (24, 4) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 3) (18, 28) (13, 6) (13, 25) (13, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (10, 29) (10, 16) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 24) (4, 13) (4, 11) (11, 25) (11, 4) (11, 21) (28, 27) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 7) (28, 18) (21, 17) (21, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which form the leaves of the 3-stars. These nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 13, and 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 17, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 27, 29, and 28.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 8, 24, and 10.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 26, 27, and 18.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0, 10, and 29.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 20, 25, and 23.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 17, 11, and  [These nodes are part of a 3-star with center node 4.]
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and  [These nodes are part of a 3-star with center node 5.]
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 2, 14, and  [These nodes are part of a 3-star with center node 4.]
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 27, 2, and  [These nodes are part of a 3-star with center node 7.]

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<4, (6, 13, 11)>, <5, (2, 17, 0)>, <7, (27, 29, 28)>, <21, (17, 11, 5)>. 
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
