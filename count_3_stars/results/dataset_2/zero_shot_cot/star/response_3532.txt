Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 25) (1, 2) (25, 1) (25, 28) (25, 22) (25, 2) (10, 19) (10, 16) (11, 24) (11, 22) (11, 26) (0, 24) (0, 23) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 16) (3, 27) (3, 29) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 24) (26, 11) (26, 14) (26, 5) (5, 26) (5, 22) (5, 27) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 17) (12, 19) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 21) (21, 16) (21, 27) (8, 24) (8, 18) (28, 25) (28, 17) (28, 22) (28, 18) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 14) (24, 8) (24, 23) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 27) (15, 9) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 4) (23, 0) (23, 24) (23, 15) (23, 4) (6, 20) (6, 15) (6, 29) (29, 3) (29, 6) (29, 13) (29, 22) (19, 10) (19, 12) (27, 3) (27, 5) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 17) (13, 9) (13, 29) (7, 14) (7, 5) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 29) (17, 2) (17, 28) (17, 27) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 23) (18, 8) (18, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, first, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's denote the nodes based on the edges given:
(1, 25, 2), (10, 19, 16), (11, 24, 22), (0, 23, 24), (20, 4, 6), (3, 27, 29), (14, 26, 7), (5, 22, 26), (17, 2, 28), (12, 19, 16), (21, 16, 27), (8, 24, 18), (14, 24, 26), (6, 15, 20), (9, 15, 23), (13, 9, 29), (7, 14, 5)

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars present:
<1, (25, 2, 28)>, <25, (1, 22, 28)>, <25, (2, 22, 28)>, <25, (28, 22, 5)>, <10, (19, 16, 12)>, <19, (10, 16, 12)>, <16, (10, 19, 21)>, <16, (10, 20, 21)>, <16, (10, 21, 27)>, <11, (24, 22, 26)>, <24, (11, 22, 8)>, <24, (11, 14, 8)>, <24, (0, 14, 8)>, <24, (0, 23, 8)>, <24, (11, 14, 7)>, <24, (0, 14, 7)>, <24, (0, 14, 6)>, <0, (24, 23, 14)>, <0, (24, 23, 4)>, <20, (4, 6, 15)>, <4, (20, 23, 15)>, <6, (20, 29, 15)>, <3, (27, 29, 17)>, <27, (3, 21, 17)>, <27, (3, 9, 21)>, <27, (5, 9, 21)>, <26, (14, 7, 5)>, <5, (26, 22, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
