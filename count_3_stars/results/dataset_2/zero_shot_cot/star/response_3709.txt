Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 8) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 16) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 14) (6, 0) (6, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 2) (18, 6) 

Response:
First, identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Central nodes must have 3 edges connected to them.

The central nodes are:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 9, 4, and 14)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 5, 2, and 4)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 9, 0, and 13)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 5, 9, and 15) 
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 9, 14, and 16)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 5, 8, and 2)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 9, 10, and 15)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 7, 10, and 6)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 0, 15, and 19)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 7, 4, and 13)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 3, 10, and 14)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 1, 17, and 8)
- Node 16 (connected to nodes 17, 2, and none)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars we found:
<5, (9, 4, 14)>
<9, (5, 2, 4)>
<10, (9, 0, 13)>
<4, (5, 9, 15)>
<2, (9, 14, 16)>
<14, (5, 8, 2)>
<13, (9, 10, 15)>
<0, (7, 10, 6)>
<7, (0, 15, 19)>
<15, (7, 4, 13)>
<8, (3, 10, 14)>
<3, (1, 17, 8)>
<16, (17, 2)>

There are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
