Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 18) (0, 5) (27, 0) (27, 18) (9, 1) (9, 24) (9, 23) (1, 9) (1, 21) (1, 16) (1, 19) (21, 15) (21, 1) (21, 14) (28, 13) (28, 23) (29, 0) (29, 13) (29, 10) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 17) (26, 3) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 17) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 5) (11, 26) (23, 9) (23, 28) (23, 7) (4, 12) (4, 25) (4, 20) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 22) (22, 3) (22, 12) (10, 29) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 12) (14, 3) (14, 21) (14, 25) (8, 25) (8, 16) (7, 23) (7, 20) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 7) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (18, 0) (18, 27) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 25) (13, 28) (13, 29) (13, 16) (17, 24) (17, 26) (17, 12) (25, 4) (25, 14) (25, 8) (25, 18) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star consisting of a central node and three leaves.

Let's list all the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

<3, (15, 26, 22)>
<15, (3, 24, 21)>
<0, (27, 29, 18)>
<27, (0, 18, 9)>
<9, (1, 24, 23)>
<1, (9, 21, 19)>
<21, (15, 1, 14)>
<28, (13, 23, 29)>
<29, (0, 13, 10)>
<24, (15, 9, 26)>
<26, (3, 24, 10)>
<5, (0, 19, 5)>
<19, (1, 5, 19)>
<11, (26, 17, 11)>
<23, (9, 28, 7)>
<4, (12, 20, 25)>
<12, (4, 22, 17)>
<22, (3, 12, 22)>
<10, (29, 26, 18)>
<2, (12, 2, 17)>
<14, (3, 21, 25)>
<8, (25, 16, 8)>
<7, (23, 20, 7)>
<16, (1, 10, 8)>
<18, (0, 27, 12)>
<13, (28, 29, 16)>
<17, (24, 26, 12)>
<25, (4, 14, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
