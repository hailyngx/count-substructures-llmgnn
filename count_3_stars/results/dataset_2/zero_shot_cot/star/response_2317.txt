Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 9) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, 6, 5, and 10.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 13, 14, 9, and 10.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 14, 10, and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 10, and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 6, and 12.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 12, 14, 2, and 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 3, 8, and 2.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
We can see the following unique 3-stars:
- <1, (4, 7, 10)>
- <2, (13, 14, 10)>
- <3, (1, 0, 14)>
- <4, (12, 0, 10)>
- <6, (1, 8, 6)>
- <9, (12, 14, 0)>
- <10, (4, 1, 3)>
- <12, (7, 1, 12)>
- <14, (9, 12, 14)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
