Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (18, 10) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 16) (6, 10) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 0) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 19) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 9) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 9) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 9) (12, 19) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 9) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 3, which is our potential center for the 3-stars. 
Node 3 is connected to nodes 17, 16, 19, and 4. 

Now, let's check for each potential 3-star centered at node 3: 
1. Node 3 - (17, 16, 19) forms a 3-star. 
2. Node 3 - (17, 16, 4) forms a 3-star. 
3. Node 3 - (17, 19, 4) does not form a 3-star. 
4. Node 3 - (16, 19, 4) does not form a 3-star. 

Therefore, there are two unique 3-stars centered at node 3 in this graph: 
<3, (17, 16, 19)> 
<3, (17, 16, 4)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
