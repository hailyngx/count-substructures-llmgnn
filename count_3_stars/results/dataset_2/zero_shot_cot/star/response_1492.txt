Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (15, 19) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 19) (6, 18) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 11) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 0) (11, 12) (11, 19) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 19) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (2, 5, 13)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (9, 17, 19)>
<4, (7, 8, 10)>
<5, (0, 2, 17)>
<7, (4, 0, 10)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (8, 3, 19)>
<10, (4, 7, 19)>
<12, (13, 16, 18)>
<13, (0, 2, 12)>
<14, (0, 16, 17)>
<16, (8, 12, 18)>
<17, (5, 14, 3)>
<18, (6, 12, 16)>
<19, (10, 15, 3)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars found:
[16]
