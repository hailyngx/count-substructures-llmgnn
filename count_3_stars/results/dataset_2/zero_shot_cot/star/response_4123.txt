Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. 

For each node, count the number of edges it is involved in. The node with exactly 3 edges will be the central node of a 3-star.

Nodes with 3 edges:
 - Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7)
 - Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 8)
 - Node 9: (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1)
 - Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 1)
 - Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 9), (1, 4)
 - Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 3)

So, the 3-stars are:
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<6, (7, 2, 4)>
<9, (8, 3, 1)>
<4, (6, 2, 3)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (2, 7, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
