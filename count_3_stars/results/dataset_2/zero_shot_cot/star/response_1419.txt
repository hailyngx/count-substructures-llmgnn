Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present.

1. <4, (7, 1, 0)>
2. <7, (4, 3, 6)>
3. <6, (7, 12, 11)>
4. <9, (11, 0, 13)>
5. <8, (13, 12, 5)>
6. <13, (8, 12, 3)>
7. <1, (4, 11, 2)>
8. <3, (7, 13, 1)>
9. <0, (4, 9, 13)>
10. <14, (1, 11, 10)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars present in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
