Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's label the nodes based on the given edges:

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 5, 9, 3
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 9, 4
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 6
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 5, 7, 1
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 1
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 0, 3
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 2
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 3
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 7, 1, 2
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 4, 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by looking at each node:

- Node 0: No 3-stars connected to this node.
- Node 1: <1, (5, 9, 4)>
- Node 2: No 3-stars connected to this node.
- Node 3: <3, (5, 7, 1)>
- Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 1)>
- Node 5: No 3-stars connected to this node.
- Node 6: No 3-stars connected to this node.
- Node 7: No 3-stars connected to this node.
- Node 8: No 3-stars connected to this node.
- Node 9: <9, (6, 4, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of three unique 3-stars in the given graph.
