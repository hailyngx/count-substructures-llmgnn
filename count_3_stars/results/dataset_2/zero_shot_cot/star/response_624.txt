Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with the nodes having degree 3, we can see that nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9 have degree 3.
- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 3)
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 5)
- Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 2)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 4: 5 3-stars since it's connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 7: 5 3-stars since it's connected to nodes 4, 0, 6, 2, and 5.
- Node 8: 5 3-stars since it's connected to nodes 4, 1, 2, and 9.
- Node 9: 4 3-stars since it's connected to nodes 4, 3, 8, and 2.

In total, there are 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 19 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<8, (4, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 3, 8)>
