Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 0, 2)>
<2, (5, 0, 3)>
<3, (9, 6, 7)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<5, (2, 1, 0)>
<6, (7, 0, 3)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>
<9, (3, 4, 1)>
<10, (3, 4, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
