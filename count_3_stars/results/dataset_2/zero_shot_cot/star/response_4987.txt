Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 18) (15, 17) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 10) (0, 27) (0, 12) (0, 1) (3, 25) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 2) (25, 3) (25, 4) (25, 21) (6, 9) (6, 21) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 12) (10, 27) (10, 12) (10, 23) (17, 15) (17, 21) (17, 7) (28, 14) (28, 19) (29, 19) (22, 9) (22, 14) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 26) (13, 12) (13, 18) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 24) (20, 3) (20, 8) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 24) (19, 28) (19, 29) (19, 8) (19, 18) (18, 15) (18, 13) (18, 19) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 11) (5, 2) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 22) (14, 7) (24, 21) (24, 8) (24, 7) (24, 23) (1, 0) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 24) (16, 23) (16, 4) (4, 25) (4, 16) (4, 23) (4, 11) (23, 10) (23, 24) (23, 16) (23, 4) (11, 26) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) 

Response:
The steps to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three edges incident on them. These nodes will be potential centers of 3-stars.
   Nodes with three incident edges: 15, 27, 21, 8, 19, 18, 2, 4, 11

2. For each potential center, check if it forms a 3-star.
   - For node 15: <15, (27, 18, 17)>
   - For node 27: <27, (15, 0, 10)>
   - For node 21: <21, (25, 6, 17)>
   - For node 8: <8, (3, 20, 19)>, <8, (21, 24, 19)>
   - For node 19: <19, (28, 29, 8)>, <19, (18, 8, 29)>
   - For node 18: <18, (13, 15, 19)>, <18, (19, 13, 15)>
   - For node 2: <2, (3, 5, 11)>
   - For node 4: <4, (25, 16, 23)>, <4, (16, 23, 11)>
   - For node 11: <11, (26, 2, 4)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars found.
   Total number of 3-stars: 11

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
