Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star in the given graph. In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Nodes connected to 5: 9, 8, 7
Nodes connected to 9: 5, 6, 2, 3, 7
Nodes connected to 6: 9, 7, 3, 0
Nodes connected to 4: 0, 1, 3, 2
Nodes connected to 8: 5, 2, 3
Nodes connected to 2: 9, 4, 8, 1
Nodes connected to 0: 6, 4, 3, 1
Nodes connected to 7: 5, 9, 6, 1
Nodes connected to 3: 9, 6, 4, 8, 0
Nodes connected to 1: 4, 2, 0, 7

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- 5 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 9, 8, 7.
- 9 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 5, 6, 7.
- 6 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 9, 7, 3.
- 4 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 0, 1, 3.
- 8 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 5, 2, 3.
- 2 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 9, 4, 1.
- 0 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 6, 4, 3.
- 7 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 5, 9, 1.
- 3 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 9, 6, 4.
- 1 is the center of one 3-star with leaves 4, 2, 0.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10. 
Therefore, the answer is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <6, (9, 7, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (5, 2, 3)>, <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <0, (6, 4, 3)>, <7, (5, 9, 1)>, <3, (9, 6, 4)>, <1, (4, 2, 0)>.
