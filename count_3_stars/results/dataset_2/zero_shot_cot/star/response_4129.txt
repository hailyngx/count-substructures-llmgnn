Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (2, 5, 9)>
