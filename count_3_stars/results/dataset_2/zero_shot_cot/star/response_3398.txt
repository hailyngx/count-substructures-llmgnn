Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to the center node (degree 3) and list the 3-stars:
- Node 1: (9, 3, 2), (6, 10, 0), (2, 8, 14)
- Node 4: (11, 8, 12), (13, 6, 14), (14, 0, 11)
- Node 6: (5, 1, 10), (8, 13, 5), (1, 10, 5)
- Node 11: (10, 14, 8), (4, 12, 0), (12, 8, 14)
- Node 12: (11, 0, 7), (4, 2, 13), (7, 0, 2)
- Node 13: (9, 4, 12), (6, 12, 4), (4, 14, 6)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
<1, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (6, 10, 0)>, <1, (2, 8, 14)>, <4, (11, 8, 12)>, <4, (13, 6, 14)>, <6, (5, 1, 10)>, <11, (10, 14, 8)>, <12, (11, 0, 7)>, <12, (4, 2, 13)>, <13, (9, 4, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
