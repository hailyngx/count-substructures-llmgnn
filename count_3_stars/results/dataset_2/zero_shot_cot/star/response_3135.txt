Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (1, 13) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 15) (6, 3) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 14) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 3) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 18) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes with the following degrees are potential center nodes for 3-stars:
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3

Next, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (10, 9, 3)>
<2, (5, 19, 15)>
<16, (7, 13, 5)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
