Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars based on the given edges:

Possible 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 3, 7)>
- <2, (9, 3, 4)>
- <4, (8, 0, 6)>
- <5, (6, 1, 7)>
- <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 8)>
- <9, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [10].
