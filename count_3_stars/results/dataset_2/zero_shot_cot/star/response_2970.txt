Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 9) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 2) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (0, 16) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 17) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 13) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (1, 5) (1, 13) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 16) (18, 15) (18, 3) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 9) (17, 8) (3, 2) (3, 18) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 1) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 4
- Node 7
- Node 10
- Node 14
- Node 15

Next, we will check each potential center to see if it forms a 3-star. 

For Node 4:
- <4, (10, 14, 17)>

For Node 7:
- <7, (12, 13, 8)>

For Node 10:
- <10, (4, 11, 13)>
- <10, (11, 9, 13)>

For Node 14:
- <14, (4, 5, 16)>
- <14, (5, 4, 16)>

For Node 15:
- <15, (16, 9, 18)>
- <15, (9, 16, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
