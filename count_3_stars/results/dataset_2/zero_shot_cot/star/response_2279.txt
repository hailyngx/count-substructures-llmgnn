Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (16, 22) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (15, 22) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 25) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 28) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 9) (13, 27) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 20) (0, 12) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 2) (20, 28) (28, 7) (28, 20) (28, 18) (29, 13) (29, 1) (29, 21) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 22) (24, 22) (26, 2) (27, 4) (27, 13) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 25) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 26) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 24) (21, 29) (21, 14) (14, 11) (14, 21) (14, 18) (14, 23) (14, 25) (5, 12) (5, 25) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 6) (6, 0) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 1) (25, 4) (25, 9) (25, 14) (25, 5) (25, 12) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 6) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 18) (12, 23) (18, 28) (18, 14) (18, 12) (23, 14) (23, 6) (23, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the graph. Since a 3-star involves a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. 

From the given edges, the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them are:
- Node 1
- Node 5
- Node 16
- Node 21

Now, let's identify the leaves connected to these central nodes. 

For Node 1: (1, 8), (1, 29), (1, 6)
For Node 5: (5, 12), (5, 25), (5, 25)
For Node 16: (16, 22), (16, 22), (16, 22)
For Node 21: (21, 29), (21, 14), (21, 14)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (8, 29, 6)>
<5, (12, 25, 25)>
<16, (22, 22, 22)>
<21, (29, 14, 14)>

Since we have found 4 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [4].
