Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. We need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

The nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 8, 1, 13)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 11)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 6, 9, 10)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 13, 11, 0)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 9, 4, 2)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (8, 13, 1)>
<3, (5, 6, 11)>
<7, (6, 9, 10)>
<8, (13, 11, 0)>
<12, (9, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
