Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (4, 17) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 3) (3, 11) (3, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 13) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 16) (0, 9) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 19) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 10, 11, 16
- Node 2: 11, 14, 15, 17
- Node 3: 11, 18
- Node 4: 15, 17
- Node 5: Not connected to any other node
- Node 6: 9, 15, 16, 19
- Node 7: 8, 12, 18
- Node 8: 7, 15, 19
- Node 9: 0, 6, 10, 13, 15, 19
- Node 10: 1, 9, 12, 17
- Node 11: 1, 2, 3
- Node 12: 7, 10, 16
- Node 13: 9, 19
- Node 14: 2, 16, 19
- Node 15: 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 16: 1, 12, 14, 19, 6
- Node 17: 2, 10, 4
- Node 18: 3, 7
- Node 19: 6, 8, 9, 13, 14

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 6, 15)>
<1, (10, 11, 16)>
<2, (14, 16, 17)>
<3, (18, 11, 3)>
<4, (17, 15, 4)>
<6, (9, 15, 19)>
<7, (8, 18, 12)>
<8, (15, 19, 7)>
<9, (6, 10, 15)>
<10, (1, 9, 12)>
<11, (2, 3, 1)>
<12, (10, 16, 7)>
<13, (9, 19, 13)>
<14, (16, 19, 2)>
<15, (4, 6, 17)>
<16, (1, 14, 19)>
<17, (2, 4, 15)>
<18, (7, 3, 8)>
<19, (14, 6, 9)>

There are a total of 19 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [19].
