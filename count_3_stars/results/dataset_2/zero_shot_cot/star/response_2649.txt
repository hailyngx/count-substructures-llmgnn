Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 18) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 18) (12, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 14) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's determine the center node and its neighbors in the graph based on the given edges.

Based on the edges provided, the center node and its neighbors are:
- Center node: 3
- Neighbors: 15, 7, 9

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
1. <3, (15, 4, 2)>
2. <3, (7, 4, 0)>
3. <3, (9, 2, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. So, the final answer is [3].
