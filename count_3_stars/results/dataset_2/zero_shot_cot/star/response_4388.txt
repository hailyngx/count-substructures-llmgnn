Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 0, 7, and 14. This forms a 3-star <5, (9, 11, 0)>.
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 10, 1, and 13. This forms a 3-star <9, (5, 10, 1)>.
3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, 10, 0, and 8. This forms a 3-star <1, (9, 3, 10)>.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 13. This forms a 3-star <3, (1, 10, 13)>.
5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, and 11. This forms a 3-star <10, (9, 1, 3)>.
6. Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 14, and 7. This forms a 3-star <11, (5, 10, 14)>.

Now, counting the number of 3-stars identified, we have 6 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
