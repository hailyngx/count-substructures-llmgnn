Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (5, 0) (5, 3) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 7) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (9, 3) (9, 10) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 12) (1, 19) (1, 4) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 12) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
