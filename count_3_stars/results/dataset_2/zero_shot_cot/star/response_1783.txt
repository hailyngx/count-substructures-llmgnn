Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 12) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present.

Starting with the center node 0:
- <0, (3, 4, 5)>
- <0, (3, 8, 11)>

Moving on to the center node 1:
- <1, (2, 10, 12)>
- <1, (2, 8, 13)>

For center node 2:
- <2, (1, 10, 12)>
- <2, (5, 10, 12)>

For center node 3:
- <3, (0, 4, 6)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>

For center node 4:
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (7, 9, 14)>

For center node 5:
- <5, (0, 2, 10)>
- <5, (4, 9, 14)>

For center node 6:
- <6, (0, 3, 8)>
- <6, (3, 8, 14)>

For center node 7:
- <7, (4, 9, 12)>
- <7, (3, 6, 12)>

For center node 8:
- <8, (0, 6, 14)>
- <8, (1, 2, 13)>

For center node 9:
- <9, (4, 7, 14)>
- <9, (1, 10, 12)>

For center node 10:
- <10, (1, 2, 5)>
- <10, (2, 5, 9)>

For center node 11:
- <11, (0, 2, 6)>
- <11, (1, 10, 14)>

For center node 12:
- <12, (1, 7, 8)>
- <12, (2, 7, 13)>

For center node 13:
- <13, (8, 12, 14)>

For center node 14:
- <14, (6, 8, 9)>
- <14, (4, 7, 9)>

Counting all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [26].
