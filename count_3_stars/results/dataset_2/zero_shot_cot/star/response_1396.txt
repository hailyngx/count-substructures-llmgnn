Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 2) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 25) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (10, 1) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 23) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 8) (15, 20) (15, 23) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 25) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (28, 16) (28, 19) (7, 2) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 19) (3, 21) (3, 18) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 16) (12, 4) (23, 10) (23, 15) (26, 16) (26, 6) (19, 10) (19, 28) (19, 16) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 29) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 29) (27, 5) (27, 29) (29, 14) (29, 24) (29, 8) (29, 27) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 21) (2, 7) (18, 3) (18, 24) (6, 26) (6, 25) (25, 22) (25, 14) (25, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<13, (22, 20, 2)>
<5, (9, 0, 27)>
<9, (5, 4, 11)>
<1, (21, 17, 2)>
<21, (1, 3, 2)>
<10, (17, 19, 23)>
<17, (1, 10, 8)>
<15, (20, 23, 15)>
<20, (13, 15, 12)>
<0, (5, 14, 24)>
<14, (0, 29, 25)>
<11, (9, 8, 4)>
<28, (16, 19, 16)>
<16, (28, 12, 4)>
<3, (21, 18, 3)>
<4, (9, 1, 11)>
<12, (9, 20, 16)>
<23, (10, 15, 23)>
<26, (16, 6, 25)>
<19, (10, 28, 16)>
<24, (0, 18, 29)>
<8, (17, 11, 29)>
<27, (5, 29, 27)>
<29, (14, 24, 8)>
<2, (13, 21, 7)>
<18, (3, 24, 18)>
<6, (26, 25, 6)>
<25, (22, 14, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].
