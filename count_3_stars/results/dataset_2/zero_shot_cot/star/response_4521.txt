Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we first need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars in the graph. 

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 7, and 8.

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>

Hence, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
