Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 2) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 4) (7, 11) (7, 15) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 14) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 13) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 11) (19, 18) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 15) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 16) (15, 14) (4, 17) (4, 6) (4, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three leaves, we will look for nodes with exactly 3 incident edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 14, 18)>
<9, (5, 8, 16)>
<10, (11, 17, 7)>
<11, (10, 19, 7)>
<12, (16, 13, 14)>
<16, (9, 12, 15)>
<17, (10, 0, 4)>
<1, (9, 8, 6)>
<7, (11, 15, 7)>
<13, (12, 1, 0)>

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique instances listed. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
