Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 14) (22, 14) (22, 20) (3, 15) (3, 28) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 8) (1, 5) (1, 24) (1, 27) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 19) (6, 16) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 8) (20, 22) (20, 29) (20, 2) (20, 16) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 24) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 2) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 6) (16, 20) (16, 0) (16, 12) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 14) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 26) (12, 16) (12, 26) (12, 23) (24, 1) (24, 6) (24, 29) (24, 17) (24, 23) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 12) (19, 6) (19, 27) (11, 14) (11, 18) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 11) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 5) (23, 12) (23, 24) (23, 18) (23, 25) (23, 27) (8, 15) (8, 21) (7, 10) (9, 28) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 27) (4, 13) (4, 17) (17, 24) (17, 5) (17, 4) (27, 1) (27, 19) (27, 23) (27, 5) (25, 23) 

Response:
Observing the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (21, 24, 16)>
<10, (21, 2, 26)>
<14, (13, 22, 28)>
<16, (6, 20, 0)>
<23, (12, 24, 18)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
