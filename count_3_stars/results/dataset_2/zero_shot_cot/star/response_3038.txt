Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 17) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 19) (7, 21) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 25) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 28) (12, 23) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 13) (26, 11) (26, 8) (17, 15) (17, 20) (17, 24) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 16) (11, 26) (11, 23) (11, 2) (23, 12) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 25) (23, 3) (9, 20) (9, 2) (9, 28) (29, 15) (29, 8) (29, 22) (29, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 19) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (16, 12) (16, 20) (16, 3) (3, 23) (3, 16) (3, 22) (19, 27) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 1) (4, 1) (4, 19) (25, 21) (25, 23) (18, 29) (18, 0) (28, 12) (28, 9) (14, 10) (24, 15) (24, 17) (8, 7) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 29) (8, 22) (22, 29) (22, 3) (22, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. 
Let's identify those nodes:
- Node 15 has edges to nodes (27, 29, 17, 24).
- Node 27 has edges to nodes (15, 12, 19).
- Node 7 has edges to nodes (21, 8).
- Node 21 has edges to nodes (7, 8, 25).
- Node 12 has edges to nodes (27, 16, 28, 23).
- Node 6 has edges to nodes (5, 1, 10, 0).
- Node 13 has edges to nodes (26, 19).
- Node 26 has edges to nodes (13, 11, 8).
- Node 17 has edges to nodes (15, 20, 24).
- Node 20 has edges to nodes (17, 9, 23, 16).
- Node 11 has edges to nodes (26, 23, 2).
- Node 23 has edges to nodes (12, 20, 11, 25, 3).
- Node 9 has edges to nodes (20, 2, 28).
- Node 29 has edges to nodes (15, 8, 22, 18).
- Node 1 has edges to nodes (6, 2, 4, 19).
- Node 0 has edges to nodes (6, 10, 18).
- Node 10 has edges to nodes (6, 0, 14).
- Node 16 has edges to nodes (12, 20, 3).
- Node 3 has edges to nodes (23, 16, 22).
- Node 19 has edges to nodes (27, 13, 1, 4).
- Node 2 has edges to nodes (11, 9, 1).
- Node 4 has edges to nodes (1, 19).
- Node 25 has edges to nodes (21, 23).
- Node 18 has edges to nodes (29, 0).
- Node 28 has edges to nodes (12, 9).
- Node 14 has edges to nodes (10).
- Node 8 has edges to nodes (7, 21, 26, 29, 22).
- Node 22 has edges to nodes (29, 3, 8).

Now, let's list the unique 3-star configurations:
<15, (27, 29, 17)>
<27, (15, 12, 19)>
<21, (7, 8, 25)>
<12, (27, 16, 28)>
<6, (5, 1, 10)>
<13, (26, 19, 0)>
<26, (13, 11, 8)>
<17, (15, 20, 24)>
<20, (17, 9, 23)>
<11, (26, 23, 2)>
<23, (12, 20, 25)>
<9, (20, 2, 28)>
<29, (15, 8, 22)>
<1, (6, 2, 4)>
<0, (6, 10, 18)>
<16, (12, 20, 3)>
<3, (23, 16, 22)>
<19, (27, 13, 1)>
<2, (11, 9, 1)>
<25, (21, 23)>
<8, (7, 21, 26)>
<18, (29, 0)>
<28, (12, 9)>
<10, (6, 14)>
<14, (10)>

There are a total of [24] 3-stars in the given graph.
