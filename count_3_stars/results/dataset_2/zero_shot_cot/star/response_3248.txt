Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list all the nodes that are directly connected to node 5 (neighbor nodes of node 5): 9, 11, 4, 0, 7, 14.
Now, let's find all 3-stars in the graph centered at node 5 using these neighbor nodes.
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 11, 4)>
<5, (9, 14, 13)>
<5, (4, 11, 1)>
<5, (4, 0, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 12)>
<5, (0, 6, 3)>
<5, (0, 3, 13)>
<5, (7, 3, 0)>
Count of 3-stars: [8]
