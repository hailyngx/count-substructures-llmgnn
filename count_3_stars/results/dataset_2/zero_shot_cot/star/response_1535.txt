Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each other:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 10.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 10, 11, 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 10, 12, 14.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 11, 13, 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 12, 13.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 11, 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, 8, 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 8.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 6, 7, 11.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 4: <4, (1, 10, 14)>
- From node 6: <6, (1, 10, 14)>
- From node 7: <7, (2, 11, 14)>
- From node 10: <10, (3, 4, 12)>
- From node 11: <11, (5, 7, 12)>
- From node 12: <12, (8, 10, 11)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
