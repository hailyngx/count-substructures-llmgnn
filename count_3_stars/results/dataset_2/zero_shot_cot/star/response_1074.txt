Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 20) (16, 2) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 25) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 3) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 5) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 26) (20, 23) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 15) (24, 6) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 15) (26, 20) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 23) (27, 24) (27, 25) (27, 28) (18, 26) (18, 1) (29, 20) (29, 8) (29, 3) (10, 16) (10, 21) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 10) (25, 22) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 14) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 14) (12, 25) (12, 28) (12, 14) (8, 29) (28, 4) (28, 27) (28, 12) (17, 6) (17, 0) (3, 9) (3, 29) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 3) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 19) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 1) (15, 5) (15, 24) (19, 24) (19, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node of each 3-star. To do this, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges emanating from them since the center of a 3-star is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes with 3 edges: 13, 22, 4, 7, 6, 9, 20, 5, 24, 26, 12, 1, 2, 15, 19

Next, let's determine the 3-stars by checking the connections for each potential center node from the list above.

For node 13: <13, (22, 2, 21)>
For node 22: <22, (13, 9, 5)>
For node 4: <4, (7, 28, 21)>
For node 7: <7, (4, 1, -)>
For node 6: <6, (5, 24, 17)>
For node 9: <9, (22, 14, 3)>
For node 20: <20, (11, 0, 29)>
For node 5: <5, (22, 6, 0)>
For node 24: <24, (6, 26, 15)>
For node 26: <26, (20, 24, 18)>
For node 12: <12, (25, 28, 14)>
For node 1: <1, (7, 18, 2)>
For node 2: <2, (16, 13, 1)>
For node 15: <15, (5, 24, -)>
For node 19: <19, (24, 1, -)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we have 14 in total. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
