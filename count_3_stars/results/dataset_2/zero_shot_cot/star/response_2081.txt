Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 13) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the nodes and their neighbors:

0: 7, 10, 11, 9 
1: 9, 2 
2: 7, 1, 12, 3, 14
3: 4, 8, 2, 14, 5 
4: 8, 9, 13, 11, 3 
5: 7, 12, 11, 3 
6: 7, 11 
7: 0, 6, 14, 2, 5, 13 
8: 4, 9, 12, 3 
9: 4, 8, 0, 1, 13 
10: 0, 14 
11: 4, 0, 6, 5 
12: 8, 2, 5 
13: 4, 7, 9, 14 
14: 7, 10, 2, 3, 13 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 6.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 14, and 10.

Hence, the unique 3-stars found are <1, (9, 2, 1)>, <6, (7, 11, 6)>, and <10, (0, 14, 10)>.

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
