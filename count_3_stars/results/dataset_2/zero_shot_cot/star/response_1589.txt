Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential centers of the 3-stars. 

The nodes with 3 connections are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9.

Next, for each of these potential center nodes, we will check if the connected nodes form a 3-star pattern. 

For node 1: (1, 5, 7), (1, 3, 8) <1, (5, 7, 3), (7, 1, 8), (3, 1, 5)>
For node 2: (2, 6, 7), (2, 3, 5) <2, (6, 7, 3)>
For node 3: (3, 5, 1), (3, 9, 2), (3, 1, 8), (3, 2, 7), (3, 8, 0) <3, (5, 1, 9), (5, 3, 2), (9, 3, 2), (3, 8, 1), (2, 3, 7)>
For node 5: (5, 9, 6), (5, 6, 2), (5, 1, 3) <5, (9, 6, 2), (6, 5, 1), (5, 3, 1)>
For node 6: (6, 5, 2), (6, 4, 8) <6, (5, 2, 6)>
For node 9: (9, 5, 6), (9, 6, 3), (9, 1, 3) <9, (5, 9, 6), (6, 3, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find a total of 16 unique 3-stars.
