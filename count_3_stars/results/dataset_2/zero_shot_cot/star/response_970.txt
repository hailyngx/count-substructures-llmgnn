Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <5, (1, 3, 7)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 6: <9, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <6, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 3, and 6: <1, (5, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 6: <3, (5, 1, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 2: <4, (6, 1, 2)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 0: <7, (5, 8, 0)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 0: <2, (4, 8, 0)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8. 
So, the answer is [8].
