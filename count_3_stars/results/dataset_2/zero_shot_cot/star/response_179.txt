Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 27) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 25) (17, 6) (2, 8) (2, 12) (18, 14) (18, 21) (18, 25) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 19) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 26) (8, 27) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 0) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 26) (6, 17) (6, 28) (6, 20) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 22) (9, 21) (22, 9) (22, 0) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 16) (5, 20) (19, 12) (19, 25) (19, 16) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 24) (10, 15) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 4) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 10) (21, 16) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 23) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 25) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 21) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 13) (27, 3) (27, 8) (27, 29) (20, 6) (20, 5) (20, 4) (24, 1) (24, 0) (4, 10) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 4) (25, 14) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (15, 10, 24)>
<2, (8, 12, 19)>
<3, (27, 8, 29)>
<4, (10, 23, 20)>
<5, (20, 6, 28)>
<6, (17, 28, 13)>
<7, (14, 12, 9)>
<8, (2, 11, 26)>
<9, (7, 22, 21)>
<10, (15, 21, 0)>
<11, (8, 1, 23)>
<12, (2, 7, 19)>
<13, (6, 0, 4)>
<14, (18, 7, 25)>
<15, (1, 10, 15)>
<16, (26, 19, 21)>
<17, (6, 20, 28)>
<18, (14, 21, 25)>
<19, (12, 16, 25)>
<20, (6, 5, 4)>
<21, (18, 10, 16)>
<22, (9, 0, 21)>
<23, (11, 4, 25)>
<24, (1, 0, 13)>
<25, (14, 18, 23)>
<26, (8, 28, 16)>
<27, (3, 8, 29)>
<28, (29, 6, 20)>
<29, (28, 27, 26)>

There are a total of 29 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
So, the final answer is: [29]
