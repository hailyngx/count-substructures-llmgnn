Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each possible 3-star. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the steps:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
   - Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7)
   - Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0)
   - Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 3), (4, 2)
   - Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2)
   - Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 0), (1, 8)
   - Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8)
   - Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8)
   - Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 1)
   - Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 3)

2. For each of these nodes, determine if they form a 3-star.
   - Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 0: <5, (9, 4, 0)>
   - Node 9 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 3 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 0 does not form a 3-star.
   - Node 6 does not form a 3-star.

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
   - We found only 1 unique 3-star: <5, (9, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
