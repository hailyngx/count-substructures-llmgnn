Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify each unique 3-star in the graph. 

In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. We can identify each 3-star by looking at each node and checking if it has exactly 3 edges connected to it. 

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0 has degree 4 (not a center of any 3-star).
- Node 1 has degree 4 (not a center of any 3-star).
- Node 2 has degree 6 (possible center of a 3-star).
  <2, (0, 4, 5)> - 3-star centered at node 2.
- Node 3 has degree 1 (not a center of any 3-star).
- Node 4 has degree 5 (possible center of a 3-star).
  <4, (1, 2, 5)> - 3-star centered at node 4.
- Node 5 has degree 5 (possible center of a 3-star).
  <5, (0, 1, 4)> - 3-star centered at node 5.
- Node 6 has degree 4 (not a center of any 3-star).
- Node 7 has degree 4 (not a center of any 3-star).
- Node 8 has degree 3 (not a center of any 3-star).
- Node 9 has degree 4 (not a center of any 3-star).

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3], and they are <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <5, (0, 1, 4)>.
