Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 3, and 2
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 5, and 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 6, 9, and 2
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 6, 1, and 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 2)>
- Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (6, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
