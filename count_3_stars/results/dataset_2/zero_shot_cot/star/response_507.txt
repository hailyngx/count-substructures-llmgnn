Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 9) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 24) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 26) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 14) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 20) (18, 13) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 29) (20, 18) (20, 27) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 25) (14, 0) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 28) (6, 23) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 5) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 13) (17, 13) (17, 16) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 23) (12, 21) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 29) (24, 21) (24, 22) (11, 2) (11, 23) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 10) (27, 20) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 9) (22, 2) (22, 24) (8, 15) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 13) (19, 7) (4, 5) (5, 28) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 29) (10, 3) (10, 23) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 16) (29, 15) (29, 12) (29, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

<1, (16, 19, 9)>
<3, (25, 10, 26)>
<25, (3, 14, 0)>
<2, (18, 22, 12)>
<18, (2, 20, 13)>
<15, (6, 8, 29)>
<0, (14, 7, 16)>
<6, (15, 0, 28)>
<28, (21, 6, 5)>
<13, (2, 26, 17)>
<17, (13, 16, 19)>
<7, (0, 12, 19)>
<5, (4, 8, 29)>
<10, (3, 23, 0)>
<9, (1, 16, 0)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars: [15].
