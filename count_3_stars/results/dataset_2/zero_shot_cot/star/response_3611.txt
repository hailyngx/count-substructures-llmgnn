Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 7) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 20) (23, 10) (23, 9) (4, 20) (4, 26) (8, 28) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 27) (26, 4) (26, 1) (26, 11) (21, 19) (28, 8) (28, 12) (28, 18) (28, 5) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 25) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 23) (9, 27) (9, 19) (10, 23) (10, 3) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 20) (6, 0) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 16) (11, 26) (11, 29) (25, 13) (25, 18) (0, 6) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 1) (27, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 6) (24, 12) (24, 7) (24, 29) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 18) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 25) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 21) (19, 9) (19, 20) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 29) (20, 22) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 19) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 15) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 27, and 6: <1, (2, 27, 6)>
2. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 28, and 13: <5, (17, 28, 13)>
3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 24, and 18: <7, (17, 24, 18)>
4. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 23, 27, and 19: <9, (23, 27, 19)>
5. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 28, 3, and 24: <12, (28, 3, 24)>
6. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 5, and 18: <16, (22, 5, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
