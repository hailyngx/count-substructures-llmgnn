Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 10) 

Response:
First, identify all the 3-stars present in the graph by looking for nodes with exactly three edges. 

The nodes with three edges are: 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8. Letâ€™s find all the 3-stars using these nodes:

- For node 1: <1, (9, 3, 4)>
- For node 3: <3, (1, 11, 13)>
- For node 6: <6, (14, 2, 4)>
- For node 7: <7, (11, 0, 14)>
- For node 8: <8, (5, 10, 11)>
