Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's identify the nodes and their connections:

Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5
Node 2: 1, 6, 7
Node 3: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9
Node 4: 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6
Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 8: 0, 4, 6
Node 9: 3, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 0)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [10].
