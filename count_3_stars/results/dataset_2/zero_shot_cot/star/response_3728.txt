Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 9) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 16) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 26) (8, 3) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 10) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 17) (28, 1) (28, 10) (9, 12) (9, 24) (9, 20) (22, 15) (22, 0) (4, 1) (4, 25) (18, 27) (18, 21) (26, 8) (5, 19) (5, 25) (5, 21) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 10) (17, 11) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 24) (20, 9) (20, 17) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 15) (21, 18) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 2) (15, 22) (15, 19) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (7, 19) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 8) (3, 2) (24, 8) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 7) (1, 28) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 21) (2, 3) (2, 1) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 6) (0, 25) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 0) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 29) (10, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-star patterns we are looking for have one central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<8, (12, 23, 24)>
<9, (12, 20, 24)>
<10, (23, 28, 29)>
<11, (23, 17, 0)>
<14, (12, 6, 7)>
<15, (22, 19, 16)>
<16, (27, 21, 15)>
<17, (11, 20, 24)>
<18, (27, 21, 16)>
<19, (5, 15, 7)>
<20, (9, 17, 24)>
<21, (18, 5, 16)>
<22, (15, 0, 19)>
<23, (8, 10, 28)>
<24, (8, 9, 17)>
<25, (4, 29, 0)>
<26, (8, - , -)> (Incomplete star)
<27, (12, 18, 16)>
<28, (1, 10, -)> (Incomplete star)
<29, (7, 25, 10)>
<28, (1, 10, -)> (Incomplete star)

The unique 3-stars are: 
<8, (12, 23, 24)>
<9, (12, 20, 24)>
<10, (23, 28, 29)>
<11, (23, 17, 0)>
<14, (12, 6, 7)>
<15, (22, 19, 16)>
<16, (27, 21, 15)>
<17, (11, 20, 24)>
<18, (27, 21, 16)>
<19, (5, 15, 7)>
<20, (9, 17, 24)>
<21, (18, 5, 16)>
<22, (15, 0, 19)>
<25, (4, 29, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
