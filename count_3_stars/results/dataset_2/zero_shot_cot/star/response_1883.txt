Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 13) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 14) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 23) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 7) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 24) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 29) (22, 23) (22, 4) (23, 15) (23, 27) (23, 22) (4, 22) (4, 26) (9, 18) (9, 10) (9, 16) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 11) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 25) (26, 6) (26, 12) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 18) (20, 29) (20, 11) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 20) (6, 26) (18, 9) (18, 28) (18, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 2) (16, 10) (24, 15) (24, 13) (24, 16) (11, 17) (11, 20) (11, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 21) (5, 17) (0, 17) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 11) (14, 15) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 25) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 16) (10, 12) (25, 26) (25, 12) (2, 7) (2, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Starting with the first node listed:
Node 3 is connected to 1, 28, and 13 <3, (1, 13, 28)>

Moving on to the next nodes:
Node 15 is connected to 27, 23, and 14 <15, (27, 23, 14)>
Node 27 is connected to 15, 23, and 21 <27, (15, 23, 21)>
Node 1 is connected to 3, 17, and 29 <1, (3, 17, 29)>
Node 7 is connected to 1, 10, and 2 <7, (1, 10, 2)>
Node 21 is connected to 12, 5, and 29 <21, (12, 5, 29)>
Node 22 is connected to 23, 4, and 0 <22, (23, 4, 0)>
Node 4 is connected to 22, 26, and 6 <4, (22, 26, 6)>
Node 9 is connected to 18, 10, and 16 <9, (18, 10, 16)>
Node 17 is connected to 1, 5, and 11 <17, (1, 5, 11)>
Node 26 is connected to 4, 28, and 25 <26, (4, 28, 25)>
Node 0 is connected to 17, 28, and 11 <0, (17, 28, 11)>
Node 12 is connected to 13, 21, and 26 <12, (13, 21, 26)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found above: <3, (1, 13, 28)>, <15, (27, 23, 14)>, <27, (15, 23, 21)>, <1, (3, 17, 29)>, <7, (1, 10, 2)>, <21, (12, 5, 29)>, <22, (23, 4, 0)>, <4, (22, 26, 6)>, <9, (18, 10, 16)>, <17, (1, 5, 11)>, <26, (4, 28, 25)>, <0, (17, 28, 11)>, <12, (13, 21, 26)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 13.]
