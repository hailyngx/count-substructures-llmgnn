Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) 

Response:
First, identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-star graphs.

The nodes that meet this criteria are: 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 9, 0, and 2.

Next, find all the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
- Node 4: <4, (7, 6, 2)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 3, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 6: <6, (4, 7, 1)>
- Node 9: <9, (4, 1, 3)>
- Node 0: <0, (6, 9, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 1, 8)>

Count of 3-star graphs: 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
