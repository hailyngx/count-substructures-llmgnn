Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 13) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are the center of 3-stars. 
Nodes with exactly 3 adjacent edges are potential centers of 3-stars. These nodes are: 10, 14, 2, 3, 7. 

Next, let's identify the leaves connected to each potential center node:

For node 10: (11, 1, 13), <10, (11, 1, 13)>
For node 14: (0, 8, 9), <14, (0, 8, 9)>
For node 2: (1, 3, 8), <2, (1, 3, 8)>
For node 3: (2, 7, 12), <3, (2, 7, 12)>
For node 7: (3, 9, 13), <7, (3, 9, 13)>

Finally, count the number of unique 3-stars we found: <10, (11, 1, 13)>, <14, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 12)>, <7, (3, 9, 13)>. 
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 5. 
So, the final answer is [5].
