Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 14) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 3) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 10) (4, 22) (8, 9) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 13) (18, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 13) (1, 22) (26, 1) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (5, 25) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 29) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 16) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 23) (28, 8) (28, 12) (22, 4) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 24) (22, 21) (10, 25) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 22) (16, 12) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 21) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (24, 22) (24, 23) (23, 25) (23, 29) (23, 24) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 12, 21)>
<6, (9, 14, 18)>
<9, (6, 8, 29)>
<20, (1, 3, 15)>
<25, (5, 10, 19)>
<8, (9, 11, 14)>
<15, (7, 13, 20)>
<1, (13, 20, 26)>
<3, (11, 14, 20)>
<11, (3, 8, 14)>
<7, (15, 17, 0)>
<5, (2, 19, 25)>
<19, (16, 21, 25)>
<29, (5, 13, 23)>
<28, (8, 12, 28)>
<22, (1, 16, 21)>
<12, (0, 16, 28)>
<16, (12, 19, 22)>
<2, (5, 6, 17)>
<13, (1, 15, 29)>
<21, (0, 13, 22)>
<14, (3, 8, 9)>
<24, (22, 23, 24)>
<23, (24, 25, 29)>
<17, (2, 7, 17)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars:
