Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 18) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 14) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 9) (7, 16) (7, 5) (7, 13) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 15) (12, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 17) (0, 3) (0, 17) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 17) (14, 1) (14, 2) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

By analyzing the given edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (15, 6, 14)>
<2, (19, 12, 10)>
<4, (6, 11, 5)>
<5, (7, 4, 16)>
<6, (1, 8, 18)>
<7, (5, 13, 16)>
<8, (19, 10, 17)>
<9, (15, 19, 13)>
<10, (8, 2, 4)>
<11, (19, 4, 17)>
<12, (15, 2, 18)>
<13, (7, 9, 16)>
<14, (1, 2, 15)>
<15, (1, 9, 12)>
<16, (7, 5, 13)>
<17, (8, 18, 0)>
<18, (8, 6, 17)>
<19, (8, 9, 11)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars by adding the unique configurations found:
[18]
