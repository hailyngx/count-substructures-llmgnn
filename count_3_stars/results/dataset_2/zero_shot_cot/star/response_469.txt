Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 21) (10, 11) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 12) (11, 4) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 7) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 8) (20, 3) (8, 2) (8, 15) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 26) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 17) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 16) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 19) (17, 0) (17, 13) (13, 17) (13, 1) (14, 26) (14, 3) (3, 20) (3, 4) (3, 14) (25, 2) (25, 1) (25, 21) (27, 21) (27, 22) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 23) (16, 26) (24, 11) (24, 12) (24, 22) (24, 23) (19, 15) (19, 28) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 5) (29, 12) (29, 21) (21, 9) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 29) (23, 6) (23, 10) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 24) (1, 13) (1, 25) (1, 22) (22, 27) (22, 24) (22, 1) (22, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 24) (12, 29) (5, 29) (5, 22) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are part of the 3-stars. 
The nodes with degrees equal to 4 are potentially the central nodes of the 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 4: 6, 9, 0, 26, 28, 23, 29, 21, 11, 12

Next, we look at each of these nodes to see if they are indeed the central node of a 3-star. 
We will list the 3-stars found with their central nodes in <>.

<6, (9, 23, 12)>
<9, (6, 21, 29)>
<0, (15, 28, 17)>
<26, (4, 28, 14)>
<28, (0, 26, 19)>
<23, (18, 7, 24)>
<29, (26, 7, 5)>
<21, (25, 27, 9)>
<11, (10, 24, 12)>
<12, (6, 11, 29)>

Thus, the total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [10].
