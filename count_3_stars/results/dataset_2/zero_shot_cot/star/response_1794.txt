Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 11) (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 29) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 4) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 15) (17, 7) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 27) (7, 17) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 19) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (6, 27) (4, 14) (8, 29) (8, 26) (8, 3) (0, 20) (0, 29) (20, 14) (20, 0) (20, 19) (11, 22) (11, 12) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 9) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 15) (19, 14) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 20) (19, 24) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 3) (25, 27) (25, 23) (25, 24) (27, 13) (27, 18) (27, 6) (27, 25) (27, 23) (3, 21) (3, 8) (3, 26) (9, 18) (9, 28) (15, 17) (15, 16) (15, 29) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 29) (29, 21) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 10) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 27) (24, 19) (24, 25) (24, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found in this graph:

<1, (21, 10, 29)>
<2, (18, 12, 5)>
<3, (21, 8, 26)>
<4, (14, 19, 20)>
<5, (2, 19, 16)>
<8, (29, 3, 26)>
<10, (1, 24, 29)>
<11, (22, 12, 28)>
<12, (2, 19, 11)>
<13, (22, 16, 27)>
<14, (17, 19, 20)>
<15, (17, 16, 29)>
<16, (13, 5, 28)>
<17, (14, 23, 15)>
<18, (2, 27, 9)>
<19, (14, 12, 24)>
<20, (14, 0, 19)>
<21, (1, 3, 29)>
<22, (13, 11, 27)>
<23, (17, 25, 27)>
<24, (19, 25, 10)>
<25, (27, 23, 24)>
<26, (18, 8, 3)>
<27, (13, 25, 23)>
<28, (11, 16, 9)>
<29, (21, 8, 0)>

To get the count of 3-stars in the graph indicated by [], we simply count the number of unique stars listed above. Thus, there are a total of [25] 3-stars in this graph.
