Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 17) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 13) (5, 17) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 11) (17, 4) (17, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 1) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 0) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 12) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (13, 7) (13, 18) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. We will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided edges, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<2, (9, 11, 19)>
<7, (13, 18, 19)>
<8, (4, 10, 16)>
<10, (1, 3, 8)>
<11, (2, 9, 14)>
<15, (0, 3, 16)>
<16, (12, 15, 8)>
<18, (1, 7, 19)>
<19, (0, 2, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
