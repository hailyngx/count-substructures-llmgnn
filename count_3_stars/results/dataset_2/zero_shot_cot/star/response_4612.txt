Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 19) (8, 3) (8, 18) (13, 2) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 17) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 10) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (9, 12) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 5) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 15) (5, 2) (0, 11) (0, 15) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 18) (10, 3) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 2) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the 3-star patterns in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:

<11, (16, 0, 17)>
<16, (11, 17, 6)>
<8, (3, 18, 10)>
<13, (2, 5, 14)>
<7, (12, 10, 14)>
<1, (6, 14, 10)>
<6, (16, 1, 17)>
<18, (8, 19, 10)>
<19, (16, 18, 15)>
<9, (12, 15, 14)>
<15, (19, 0, 14)>
<17, (11, 16, 6)>
<2, (13, 5, 14)>
<5, (2, 15, 4)>
<0, (11, 15, 16)>
<3, (8, 10, 4)>
<10, (12, 1, 18)>
<14, (12, 15, 2)>
<4, (16, 17, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique 3-stars listed above:
