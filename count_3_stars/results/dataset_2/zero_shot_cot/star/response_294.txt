Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 2) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 8) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 18) (9, 1) (9, 8) (19, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (14, 19) (14, 4) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (3, 16) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 18) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for such structures.

Let's analyze the graph and identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 1 is a central node connected to nodes 5, 9, and 15: <1, (5, 9, 15)>
2. Node 5 is a central node connected to nodes 1, 13, and 16: <5, (1, 13, 16)>
3. Node 6 is a central node connected to nodes 2, 15, and 17: <6, (2, 15, 17)>
4. Node 8 is a central node connected to nodes 9, 15, and 18: <8, (9, 15, 18)>
5. Node 11 is a central node connected to nodes 2, 5, and 12: <11, (2, 5, 12)>
6. Node 12 is a central node connected to nodes 3, 11, and 18: <12, (3, 11, 18)>
7. Node 13 is a central node connected to nodes 2, 5, and 16: <13, (2, 5, 16)>
8. Node 15 is a central node connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8: <15, (1, 6, 8)>
9. Node 16 is a central node connected to nodes 0, 5, and 2: <16, (0, 5, 2)>
10. Node 18 is a central node connected to nodes 7, 8, and 12: <18, (7, 8, 12)>

Now, we have found all the unique 3-stars in the graph. Let's count the total number of 3-stars found.

[<1, (5, 9, 15)>, <5, (1, 13, 16)>, <6, (2, 15, 17)>, <8, (9, 15, 18)>, <11, (2, 5, 12)>, <12, (3, 11, 18)>, <13, (2, 5, 16)>, <15, (1, 6, 8)>, <16, (0, 5, 2)>, <18, (7, 8, 12)>] 
Total number of 3-stars: [10]
