Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 17) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 13) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 9) (4, 13) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (11, 14) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 18. Hence, one 3-star is <3, (1, 7, 18)>.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 17, and 3. Hence, another 3-star is <15, (2, 17, 3)>.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 19, and 5. Hence, another 3-star is <8, (2, 19, 5)>.
- Nodes 12 and 14 are each connected to nodes 0, 17, and 5. Hence, two 3-stars are <12, (0, 17, 5)> and <14, (0, 17, 5)>.

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The number of 3-stars is [4].
