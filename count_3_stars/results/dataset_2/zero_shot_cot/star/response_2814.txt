Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:
1. Start by listing all nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors, which would be the potential central nodes of the 3-stars:
 - Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 2, 1, 3
 - Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 8, 7
 - Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 0
 - Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 8, 1, 3, 2
 - Node 8 has neighbors: 9, 4, 2, 0, 1
 - Node 2 has neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 8, 7
 - Node 0 has neighbors: 6, 8, 7, 1
 - Node 1 has neighbors: 5, 6, 4, 8, 0

2. Now, let's list the 3-stars:
   - From Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 1)>, <5, (9, 8, 7)>, <5, (9, 1, 3)>
   - From Node 9: <9, (5, 8, 7)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>
   - From Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 0, 2)>
   - From Node 4: <4, (6, 8, 1)>, <4, (6, 8, 2)>
   - From Node 8: <8, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (9, 4, 2)>
   - From Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 4)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>
   - From Node 0: <0, (6, 8, 7)>, <0, (6, 8, 1)>
   - From Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [12]
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
