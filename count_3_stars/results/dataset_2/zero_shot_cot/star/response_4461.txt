Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 19) (2, 8) (2, 0) (29, 6) (29, 5) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 21) (23, 6) (23, 22) (23, 5) (0, 2) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 21) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (3, 20) (3, 28) (3, 17) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 26) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (12, 4) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 15) (7, 27) (7, 13) (26, 4) (26, 10) (26, 25) (28, 0) (28, 3) (28, 27) (28, 12) (28, 24) (10, 26) (10, 25) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 10) (25, 13) (25, 24) (5, 29) (5, 23) (5, 1) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 15) (1, 9) (1, 5) (21, 22) (21, 0) (21, 18) (13, 7) (13, 25) (13, 19) (18, 12) (18, 21) (18, 15) (24, 28) (24, 25) (15, 22) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 18) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided:

1. Identify nodes that form 3-stars by checking nodes with exactly three edges.
2. List the unique 3-stars found.

Starting with the given edges:

Nodes with 3 edges:
- 6, 8, 9, 19, 20, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 23, 29)>
<8, (2, 15, 6)>
<9, (1, 19, 6)>
<19, (13, 9, 16)>
<20, (0, 4, 3)>
<23, (22, 5, 6)>
<25, (7, 24, 26)>
<26, (10, 25, 4)>
<27, (7, 28, 4)>
<28, (27, 12, 0)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
