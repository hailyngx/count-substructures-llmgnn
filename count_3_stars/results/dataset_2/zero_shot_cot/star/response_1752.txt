Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 19) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 17) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 17) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 18) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 10) (0, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify each 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found in this graph first:

<6, (9, 5, 10)>
<9, (6, 15, 19)>
<8, (6, 13, 1)>
<13, (8, 4, 2)>
<5, (6, 18, 15)>
<3, (11, 7, 17)>
<11, (3, 14, 7)>
<1, (8, 14, 7)>
<17, (3, 16, 2)>
<4, (13, 12, 0)>
<12, (4, 2, 0)>
<2, (13, 17, 12)>
<14, (11, 1, 19)>
<16, (17, 2, 0)>
<18, (5, 11, 15)>
<7, (3, 11, 1)>
<15, (9, 5, 18)>
<10, (6, 13, 19)>
<19, (9, 14, 10)>
<0, (12, 2, 16)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars: 20.
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].
