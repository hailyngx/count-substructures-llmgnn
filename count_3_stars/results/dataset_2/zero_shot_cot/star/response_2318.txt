Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 23) (14, 15) (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 22) (17, 7) (1, 6) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 12) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 6) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 5) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 16) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (21, 14) (21, 3) (21, 4) (21, 10) (21, 29) (29, 20) (29, 21) (29, 9) (29, 19) (9, 13) (9, 29) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 0) (10, 21) (10, 24) (10, 16) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 0) (26, 25) (26, 5) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 6) (18, 23) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 18) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 2) (19, 29) (19, 9) (22, 17) (22, 11) (12, 25) (2, 28) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (21, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<11, (20, 22, 28)>
<16, (0, 5, 10)>
<21, (3, 14, 29)>
<25, (6, 20, 26)>
<28, (2, 8, 11)>
<29, (9, 19, 21)>
<0, (2, 9, 16)>
<2, (0, 7, 28)>
<4, (3, 8, 21)>
<5, (3, 11, 16)>
<6, (1, 8, 25)>
<7, (2, 15, 17)>
<9, (0, 19, 29)>
<10, (16, 21, 24)>
<12, (25, 6, None)>
<13, (0, 3, 9)>
<14, (15, 21, 23)>
<15, (7, 14, 27)>
<17, (7, 22, None)>
<18, (None, 23, None)>
<19, (None, 29, None)>
<20, (11, 20, 25)>
<22, (17, 11, None)>
<23, (18, 14, 27)>
<24, (None, 6, 10)>
<26, (5, 25, None)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and output the answer inside brackets:
