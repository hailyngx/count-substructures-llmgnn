Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (10, 11) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 5) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 1) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (12, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (9, 18) (9, 1) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 19) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 6) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 6) (5, 11) (5, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node in a 3-star pattern, meaning they have exactly three neighbors.

From the given edges, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 11 (neighbors: 16, 10, 19)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 11, 12, 15)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 13, 0, 12)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 14, 8, 4)
- Node 10 (neighbors: 11, 2, 19)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 10, 18, 4)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 17, 2, 9)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 13, 2, 1)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 8, 7, 12)
- Node 0 (neighbors: 8, 7, 6)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 3, 0, 6)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 16, 8, 3)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 17, 0, 15)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 11, 14, 6)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 16, 12, 6)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 11, 18, 5)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 8, 4, 9)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

Total number of 3-stars = 3 * (number of nodes with exactly three neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 3 * 17 = 51

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 51]

Unique 3-stars found: 
<11, (16, 10, 19)>
<16, (11, 12, 15)>
<8, (13, 0, 12)>
<13, (14, 8, 4)>
<10, (11, 2, 19)>
<2, (10, 18, 4)>
<18, (17, 2, 9)>
<4, (13, 2, 1)>
<3, (8, 7, 12)>
<0, (8, 7, 6)>
<7, (3, 0, 6)>
<12, (16, 8, 3)>
<6, (17, 0, 15)>
<19, (11, 14, 6)>
<15, (16, 12, 6)>
<5, (11, 18, 5)>
<1, (8, 4, 9)>
