Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 18) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 6) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. Let's find them step by step:

1. Starting with node 0:
   - <0, (5, 9, 19)>

2. Moving to node 1:
   - <1, (10, 15, 17)>

3. Proceeding to node 2:
   - <2, (5, 13, 17)>

4. Moving to node 3:
   - <3, (8, 9, 10)>

5. Moving to node 4:
   - No 3-star centered at node 4.

6. Moving to node 5:
   - <5, (0, 2, 9)>
   - <5, (2, 13, 17)>
   - <5, (0, 9, 19)>

7. Moving to node 6:
   - No 3-star centered at node 6.

8. Moving to node 7:
   - No 3-star centered at node 7.

9. Moving to node 8:
   - No 3-star centered at node 8.

10. Moving to node 9:
   - <9, (0, 5, 19)>
   - <9, (3, 8, 10)>
   - <9, (5, 13, 17)>
   - <9, (3, 4, 18)>
   - <9, (0, 5, 19)>

11. Moving to node 10:
   - <10, (1, 3, 15)>

12. Moving to node 11:
   - <11, (7, 15, 16)>
   - <11, (7, 15, 1)>

13. Moving to node 12:
   - No 3-star centered at node 12.

14. Moving to node 13:
   - No 3-star centered at node 13.

15. Moving to node 14:
   - No 3-star centered at node 14.

16. Moving to node 15:
   - <15, (1, 11, 6)>
   - <15, (1, 10, 17)>

17. Moving to node 16:
   - <16, (11, 17, 18)>
   - <16, (17, 1, 15)>

18. Moving to node 17:
   - <17, (2, 13, 5)>
   - <17, (16, 1, 15)>

19. Moving to node 18:
   - <18, (16, 9, 19)>
   - <18, (16, 9, 19)>

20. Moving to node 19:
   - <19, (18, 17, 0)>
   - <19, (18, 17, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
