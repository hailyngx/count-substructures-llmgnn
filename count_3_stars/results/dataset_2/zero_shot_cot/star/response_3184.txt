Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 17) (2, 11) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 21) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 0) (25, 4) (25, 22) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (9, 6) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 27) (10, 4) (11, 2) (11, 10) (11, 23) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 0) (8, 27) (13, 20) (13, 23) (20, 13) (20, 5) (17, 2) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 19) (22, 25) (22, 19) (22, 14) (1, 17) (1, 23) (4, 25) (4, 10) (4, 27) (27, 10) (27, 8) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 26) (18, 26) (18, 24) (26, 3) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 28) (21, 29) (21, 8) (21, 24) (28, 26) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 24) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 13) (23, 1) (23, 12) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 8) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 22) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 20) (7, 27) (12, 28) (12, 23) (12, 14) (24, 17) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (25, 8, 29)>
<1, (17, 23, 29)>
<2, (11, 17, 29)>
<3, (10, 25, 6)>
<4, (10, 25, 27)>
<5, (8, 20, 5)>
<6, (10, 9, 16)>
<7, (27, 26, 7)>
<8, (5, 8, 21)>
<9, (6, 10, 27)>
<12, (14, 23, 28)>
<13, (20, 23, 13)>
<14, (12, 28, 22)>
<17, (1, 19, 24)>
<18, (26, 24, 18)>
<19, (17, 22, 19)>
<20, (5, 13, 20)>
<21, (8, 21, 29)>
<22, (14, 19, 22)>
<23, (13, 12, 23)>
<24, (18, 24, 28)>
<25, (3, 4, 0)>
<26, (18, 27, 26)>
<27, (4, 7, 10)>
<28, (14, 12, 24)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
