Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique 3-stars present. Let's list them first:

<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (6, 4, 3)>
<3, (1, 8, 7)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<0, (6, 9, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 8)>

Now, to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we count the unique 3-stars listed above: 9 in total. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
