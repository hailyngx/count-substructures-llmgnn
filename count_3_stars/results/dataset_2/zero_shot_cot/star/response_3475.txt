Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (2, 8, 10)>
<10, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (6, 4, 10)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 13)>
<13, (0, 8, 10)>
<4, (0, 9, 14)>
<7, (5, 8, 10)>
<12, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 12, 13)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<2, (5, 11, 12)>
<14, (2, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of 14. 
Therefore, the final answer is [14].
