Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (1, 3) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (19, 6) (19, 10) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:

1. <14, (17, 4, 5)>
2. <17, (14, 13, 3)>
3. <3, (17, 1, 5)>
4. <4, (14, 12, 9)>
5. <12, (4, 18, 5)>
6. <18, (2, 16, 6)>
7. <16, (18, 0, 0)>
8. <7, (3, 11, 15)>
9. <11, (13, 7, 15)>
10. <5, (14, 3, 12)>
11. <9, (17, 4, 15)>
12. <15, (13, 7, 11)>
13. <10, (14, 7, 19)>
14. <19, (6, 10, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
