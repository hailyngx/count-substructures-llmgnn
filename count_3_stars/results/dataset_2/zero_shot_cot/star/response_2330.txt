Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (16, 2) (16, 19) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 2) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 5) (18, 1) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 8) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 5) (1, 17) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 4) (8, 12) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 8) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 8) (4, 10) (4, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that form 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are: 3, 13, and 18.

For node 3:
- (3, 14)
- (3, 9)
- (3, 8)
<3, (14, 9, 8)>

For node 13:
- (13, 18)
- (13, 5)
- (13, 1)
<13, (18, 5, 1)>

For node 18:
- (18, 13)
- (18, 1)
- (18, 7)
<18, (13, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
