Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 24) (5, 28) (5, 14) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 26) (1, 28) (1, 22) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 26) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 11) (26, 1) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 7) (29, 17) (29, 18) (0, 7) (0, 21) (7, 10) (7, 26) (7, 0) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 12) (21, 19) (18, 29) (18, 20) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 25) (24, 5) (24, 11) (24, 22) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 28) (19, 21) (19, 15) (19, 13) (12, 21) (12, 20) (12, 28) (20, 18) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 6) (20, 16) (8, 25) (8, 27) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 16) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 14) (25, 11) (25, 8) (27, 20) (27, 8) (27, 6) (14, 5) (14, 23) (14, 13) (14, 4) (6, 26) (6, 20) (6, 27) (6, 22) (22, 1) (22, 24) (22, 6) (28, 5) (28, 1) (28, 15) (28, 12) (2, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (16, 20) (16, 23) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the central node of a 3-star. Since the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to identify nodes with a degree of 3.

The nodes that have a degree of 3 are: 5, 1, 3, 17, 26, 7, 21, 20, 6, 22, 28.

Now, let's explore the 3-star configurations:

<5, (24, 14, 28)>
<1, (26, 22, 28)>
<3, (9, 26, 21)>
<17, (10, 29, 11)>
<26, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (10, 26, 0)>
<21, (3, 0, 12)>
<20, (18, 27, 16)>
<6, (26, 20, 27)>
<22, (24, 6, 1)>
<28, (5, 15, 12)>

Therefore, there are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [11].
