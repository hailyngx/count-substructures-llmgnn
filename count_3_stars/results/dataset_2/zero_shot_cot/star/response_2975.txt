Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 6) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star and count them. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the possible 3-stars by examining each node:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 8), (0, 5, 9), (0, 8, 12), (0, 9, 10)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 5), (1, 4, 6), (1, 5, 6), (1, 5, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 4, 7), (2, 4, 12), (2, 4, 14), (2, 6, 12)
- Node 3: (3, 7, 13), (3, 13, 0)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 13), (5, 1, 6), (5, 0, 10)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 5), (6, 1, 13), (6, 2, 12), (6, 2, 10)
- Node 7: (7, 3, 4)
- Node 8: (8, 1, 14), (8, 3, 13)
- Node 9: (9, 0, 10), (9, 10, 12)
- Node 10: (10, 5, 6), (10, 6, 9)
- Node 12: (12, 0, 9)
- Node 13: (13, 3, 8), (13, 5, 6), (13, 6, 9)
- Node 14: (14, 1, 2), (14, 1, 8), (14, 2, 11), (14, 9, 11)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (3, 8, 12)>
<0, (5, 9, 10)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 7, 12)>
<3, (7, 13, 0)>
<5, (1, 13, 6)>
<5, (0, 10, 9)>
<6, (1, 5, 13)>
<6, (2, 10, 12)>
<8, (1, 14, 8)>
<8, (3, 13, 8)>
<9, (0, 10, 12)>
<10, (5, 6, 9)>
<12, (0, 9, 10)>
<13, (3, 8, 13)>
<13, (5, 6, 9)>
<14, (1, 8, 14)>
<14, (2, 11, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
