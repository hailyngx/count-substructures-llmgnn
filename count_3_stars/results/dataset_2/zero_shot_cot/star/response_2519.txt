Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star.

1. Let's look at each node in the graph and count the number of 3-stars it is a part of:

- Node 0: <0, (6, 4, 7)> <0, (2, 3, 1)>
- Node 1: <1, (5, 7, 8)> <1, (0, 7, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (9, 3, 0)> <2, (9, 0, 3)>
- Node 3: <3, (2, 0, 6)> <3, (5, 0, 6)>
- Node 4: <4, (5, 0, 8)> <4, (5, 8, 0)>
- Node 5: <5, (9, 1, 4)> <5, (9, 4, 1)>
- Node 6: <6, (7, 0, 3)> <6, (8, 0, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 0, 8)> <7, (1, 8, 0)>
- Node 8: <8, (9, 7, 4)> <8, (6, 4, 7)>
- Node 9: <9, (8, 5, 2)> <9, (8, 2, 5)>

2. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars from the above list:
- Total unique 3-stars: 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
