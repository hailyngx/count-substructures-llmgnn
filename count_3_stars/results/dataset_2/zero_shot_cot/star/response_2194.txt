Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's locate the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as these nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 0, 3, and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 1, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 6, and 3.

Now, we will check each of these nodes to see if they can act as the center of a 3-star, meaning they have exactly three connections. Let's check:

For node 4:
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 8, 0, 3, and 1 (4 connections). Node 4 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has connections with nodes 5, 8, 1, and 3 (4 connections). Node 6 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has connections with nodes 9, 4, 6, and 3 (4 connections). Node 2 cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in the given graph. The output is: [0].
