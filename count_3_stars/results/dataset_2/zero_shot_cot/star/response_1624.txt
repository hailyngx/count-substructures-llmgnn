Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their connections to determine the 3-stars present in the graph:

Node 0: (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) -> <0, (5, 2, 1)>, <0, (5, 2, 6)>, <0, (5, 1, 6)>
Node 1: (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) -> <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 0)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>
Node 2: (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) -> <2, (8, 6, 3)>, <2, (8, 6, 0)>
Node 3: (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) -> No 3-stars
Node 4: (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) -> <4, (5, 9, 3)>, <4, (5, 9, 1)>, <4, (5, 3, 6)>, <4, (9, 3, 1)>, <4, (9, 1, 6)>, <4, (3, 1, 6)>
Node 5: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) -> <5, (8, 1, 4)>, <5, (8, 1, 0)>, <5, (8, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 4, 0)>
Node 6: (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) -> <6, (4, 2, 8)>, <6, (4, 2, 0)>, <6, (4, 8, 0)>
Node 7: (7, 9) (7, 8) -> No 3-stars
Node 8: (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) -> <8, (5, 7, 2)>, <8, (5, 7, 6)>, <8, (5, 2, 1)>, <8, (7, 2, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 1)>
Node 9: (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) -> No 3-stars

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find [11]. The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (5, 2, 1)>, <0, (5, 2, 6)>, <0, (5, 1, 6)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 0)>, <1, (4, 8, 0)>, <4, (5, 9, 3)>
