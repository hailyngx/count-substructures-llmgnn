Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star configurations by looking at each node as a potential center node. 
We will list all the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>

Since there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [9].
