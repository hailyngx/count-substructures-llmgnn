Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Let's start by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be our central nodes in the 3-stars. 

After analyzing the provided edges, we find the following central nodes along with their adjacent nodes:

- Node 5: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0)
- Node 9: (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1)
- Node 4: (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0)
- Node 8: (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0)
- Node 0: (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1)

Now, let's form all possible unique 3-stars from these central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

- <5, (9, 2, 4)>
- <9, (5, 8, 2)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>
- <8, (9, 4, 1)>
- <0, (5, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
