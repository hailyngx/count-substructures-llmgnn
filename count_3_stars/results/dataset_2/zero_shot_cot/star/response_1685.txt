Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 11) (22, 0) (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 23) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 19) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 26) (10, 11) (10, 23) (11, 13) (11, 22) (11, 10) (12, 27) (12, 8) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 19) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 12) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 26) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 14) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 29) (20, 15) (26, 3) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 16) (0, 22) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 29) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 2) (6, 4) (6, 25) (6, 18) (23, 9) (23, 10) (23, 7) (23, 24) (21, 25) (14, 3) (14, 27) (14, 29) (17, 15) (24, 23) (24, 7) (7, 23) (7, 24) (7, 18) (7, 2) (25, 28) (25, 6) (25, 21) (19, 1) (19, 12) (19, 27) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 7) (2, 16) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. Remember that a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 9, 19)>
- <2, (7, 16, 25)>
- <4, (6, 8, 13)>
- <5, (1, 9, 20)>
- <6, (4, 18, 25)>
- <7, (2, 7, 18)>
- <8, (0, 4, 12)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <10, (11, 23, 29)>
- <11, (10, 13, 22)>
- <12, (8, 19, 27)>
- <13, (4, 11, 22)>
- <14, (3, 27, 29)>
- <15, (17, 18, 20)>
- <16, (0, 2, 26)>
- <20, (9, 15, 29)>
- <25, (6, 21, 28)>
- <26, (3, 16, 28)>
- <27, (12, 14, 19)>
- <28, (25, 26, 29)>
- <29, (14, 20, 28)>

There are 21 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the count of 3-stars in this graph is [21].
