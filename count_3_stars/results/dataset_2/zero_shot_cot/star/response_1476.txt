Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are adjacent to node 5 since the central node in a 3-star can be any node. The nodes adjacent to node 5 are 1, 2, 4, and 8.

Now, let's check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star:
1. Node 1: (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) => This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center.
2. Node 2: (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) => This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center.
3. Node 4: (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) => This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center.
4. Node 8: (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) => This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center.

So, the unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<2, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<8, (5, 2, 1)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
