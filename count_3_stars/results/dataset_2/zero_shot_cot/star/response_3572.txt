Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 5) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 12) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph.

Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. The graph has 15 nodes labeled from 0 to 14.
2. There are 60 edges in the graph connecting various nodes.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- <0, (9, 4, 5)>
- <1, (10, 14, 13)>
- <3, (0, 5, 12)>
- <4, (11, 0, 5)>
- <5, (10, 0, 14)>
- <7, (6, 9, 11)>
- <8, (10, 11, 12)>
- <9, (14, 7, 0)>
- <11, (10, 7, 13)>
- <12, (0, 1, 3)>
- <13, (1, 7, 12)>
- <14, (9, 1, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
