Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 13) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
The first step is to identify nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. This would be nodes with exactly three incident edges. Let's list those nodes:
<0> has 2 incident edges.
<7> has 2 incident edges.
<11> has 2 incident edges.

The next step is to find nodes that are connected to the identified center nodes. We can then form 3-stars with these nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (4, 5, 14)>
<2, (10, 3, 13)>
<3, (9, 12, 13)>
<4, (7, 8, 10)>
<6, (2, 12, 14)>
<8, (4, 11, 12)>
<9, (0, 3, 12)>
<10, (0, 2, 4)>
<12, (6, 9, 14)>
<13, (2, 5, 11)>
<14, (6, 8, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
