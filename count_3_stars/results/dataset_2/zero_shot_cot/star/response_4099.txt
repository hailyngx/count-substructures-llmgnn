Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (12, 1) (12, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 7, 13, 14

2. Central node: 1
   Leaves: 3, 8, 9

3. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 4, 7, 11

4. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 1, 6, 8

5. Central node: 4
   Leaves: 2, 6, 9

6. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 6, 8, 10

7. Central node: 6
   Leaves: 3, 4, 5

8. Central node: 7
   Leaves: 0, 1, 2

9. Central node: 8
   Leaves: 1, 3, 5

10. Central node: 9
    Leaves: 1, 4, 0

11. Central node: 10
    Leaves: 0, 5, 14

12. Central node: 11
    Leaves: 2, 6

13. Central node: 12
    Leaves: 1, 10

14. Central node: 13
    Leaves: 0, 4, 9

15. Central node: 14
    Leaves: 0, 5, 10

There are no duplicate 3-stars in the list above, so the final answer is [15].
