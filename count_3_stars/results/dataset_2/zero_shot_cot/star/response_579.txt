Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 15) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 4) (18, 11) (18, 13) (18, 19) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 4) (9, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 15) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all vertices with exactly 3 neighbors, as these vertices can potentially be the center of a 3-star. 

Here are the vertices with 3 neighbors:
- Vertex 1 (neighbors: 3, 10, 8)
- Vertex 3 (neighbors: 1, 11, 9)
- Vertex 10 (neighbors: 1, 19, 14)
- Vertex 8 (neighbors: 1, 17, 7)
- Vertex 16 (neighbors: 7, 12, 13)
- Vertex 18 (neighbors: 11, 13, 19)
- Vertex 19 (neighbors: 10, 11, 18)
- Vertex 6 (neighbors: 7, 0, 8)
- Vertex 15 (neighbors: 17, 14, 13)
- Vertex 5 (neighbors: 8, 4)
- Vertex 4 (neighbors: 16, 19, 5)
- Vertex 2 (neighbors: 6, 15)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (3, 10, 8)>
- <3, (1, 11, 9)>
- <10, (1, 19, 14)>
- <8, (1, 17, 7)>
- <16, (7, 12, 13)>
- <18, (11, 13, 19)>
- <19, (10, 11, 18)>
- <6, (7, 0, 8)>
- <15, (17, 14, 13)>
- <5, (8, 4)>
- <4, (16, 19, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
