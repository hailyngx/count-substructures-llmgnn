Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all unique sets of one central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Calculate the degree of each node:
- Node 0: Degree 4
- Node 1: Degree 2
- Node 2: Degree 6
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 4
- Node 5: Degree 5
- Node 6: Degree 4
- Node 7: Degree 4
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 5

2. Identify 3-stars:
- Nodes with degree 3 can be central nodes in 3-stars. From the given graph, we have:
  - Node 3: (3, 0, 2), (3, 7, 0)
- Nodes with degree > 3 can be leaves in 3-star configurations. From the given graph and the central nodes above, we have:
  - Node 0: (3, 0, 7), (3, 0, 2)
  - Node 2: (3, 0, 2), (3, 2, 7), (1, 2, 6), (4, 2, 8), (5, 2, 8)
  - Node 7: (3, 7, 0), (7, 0, 5), (7, 0, 9)
  
3. List the unique 3-stars:
<3, (2, 0, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 1, 6)>
<4, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 5, 8)>

4. Count the number of 3-stars [6].
