Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.  
Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9  
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6  
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9  
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6  
Node 4: 0, 1, 9  
Node 5: 2, 3, 8, 9  
Node 6: 0, 1, 3, 8  
Node 7: 2  
Node 8: 5, 6, 9  
Node 9: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8  

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars in the graph.
- 3-stars centered at node 0: <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>
- 3-stars centered at node 1: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 3: <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- 3-stars centered at node 4: <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 5: <5, (2, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 8)>
- 3-stars centered at node 6: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>
- 3-stars centered at node 8: <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- 3-stars centered at node 9: <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars.
Total number of 3-stars = 21
