Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 22) (1, 12) (21, 13) (21, 29) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 13) (27, 12) (27, 19) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (22, 1) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 12) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 23) (28, 14) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 3) (29, 21) (29, 28) (29, 16) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 8) (13, 21) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (26, 3) (26, 7) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 18) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 10) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 20) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 24) (15, 4) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 10) (2, 13) (2, 10) (20, 18) (10, 16) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 10) (24, 22) (24, 15) 

Response:
First, we need to find all the 3-stars in the given graph. To do this, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (4, 22, 12)>
<21, (13, 29, 0)>
<0, (3, 15, 11)>
<27, (12, 19, 14)>
<17, (14, 16, 12)>
<5, (6, 8, 15)>
<13, (21, 0, 2)>
<26, (3, 7, 18)>
<28, (14, 29, 11)>
<19, (27, 17, 18)>
<10, (16, 7, 2)>
<24, (22, 15, 2)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
