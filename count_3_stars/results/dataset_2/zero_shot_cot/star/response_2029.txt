Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
- From node 6: <6, (5, 8, 4)>
- From node 9: <9, (8, 4, 3)>
- From node 1: <1, (3, 5, 4)>
- From node 3: <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- From node 5: <5, (6, 1, 4)>
- From node 4: <4, (6, 9, 1)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars: [6].
