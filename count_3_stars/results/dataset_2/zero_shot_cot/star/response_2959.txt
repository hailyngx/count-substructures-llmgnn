Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 2) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 9) (10, 4) (10, 15) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 13) (12, 4) (12, 9) (2, 16) (2, 13) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 13) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 8) (3, 19) (3, 8) (14, 18) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 12) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 6) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming potential 3-stars. These nodes are:
- Node 5: connected to nodes 11, 18, and 19
- Node 4: connected to nodes 11, 18, and 15
- Node 15: connected to nodes 1, 4, and 10
- Node 18: connected to nodes 4, 5, and 17
- Node 6: connected to nodes 1, 13, and 17
- Node 7: connected to nodes 0, 9, and 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars by examining the connections of these nodes:
- For node 5: there is one 3-star <5, (11, 18, 19)>
- For node 4: there is one 3-star <4, (11, 18, 15)>
- For node 15: there is one 3-star <15, (1, 4, 10)>
- For node 18: there is one 3-star <18, (4, 5, 17)>
- For node 6: there is one 3-star <6, (1, 13, 17)>
- For node 7: there is no 3-star as it is connected to more than three nodes

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (11, 18, 19)>, 
<4, (11, 18, 15)>, 
<15, (1, 4, 10)>, 
<18, (4, 5, 17)>.
