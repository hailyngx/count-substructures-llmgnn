Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 12) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 12) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (9, 2, 14)>
<2, (6, 8, 13)>
<3, (4, 10, 14)>
<4, (6, 13, 3)>
<5, (7, 0, 12)>
<6, (4, 9, 11)>
<7, (12, 5, 13)>
<8, (12, 2, 6)>
<9, (6, 0, 7)>
<10, (3, 5, 13)>
<11, (6, 12, 14)>
<12, (7, 8, 5)>
<13, (4, 7, 2)>
<14, (11, 3, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 14 unique 3-stars listed above.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
