Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 2) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 16) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 5) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 13) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (13, 5) (19, 14) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 5) (19, 0) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 2) (2, 11) (2, 15) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 9) (0, 19) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected as leaves to the center node in the given graph. Once we have identified all the possible 3-stars, we can count how many 3-stars exist in the graph.
Here are the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 1: 3, 13, 8
- Node 2: 11, 15
- Node 3: 1, 11, 16, 4
- Node 4: 3, 18, 5
- Node 5: 14, 4, 18, 13, 19
- Node 6: 14, 10, 9, 19
- Node 7: 11, 13
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 6, 16
- Node 10: 15, 6, 16
- Node 11: 3, 7, 2
- Node 12: 13, 15
- Node 13: 1, 7, 12, 18, 5
- Node 14: 6, 19, 16, 5
- Node 15: 10, 12, 2
- Node 16: 14, 3, 10, 9
- Node 18: 4, 19, 5, 13
- Node 19: 14, 6, 18, 5, 0

Now, we can identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (3, 13, 8)>
<3, (1, 11, 16)>
<4, (3, 18, 5)>
<5, (14, 18, 13)>
<6, (14, 10, 9)>
<7, (11, 13, 12)>
<10, (15, 6, 16)>
<11, (3, 7, 2)>
<12, (13, 15, 2)>
<13, (1, 7, 12)>
<14, (6, 19, 16)>
<15, (10, 12, 2)>
<16, (14, 3, 9)>
<18, (4, 19, 13)>
<19, (14, 6, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 15 3-stars in the graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
