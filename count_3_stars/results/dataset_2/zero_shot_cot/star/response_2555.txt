Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 14) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 5) (17, 29) (17, 3) (17, 11) (8, 28) (8, 15) (29, 17) (29, 11) (29, 18) (19, 25) (19, 5) (19, 18) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 28) (9, 21) (9, 24) (9, 0) (22, 4) (22, 20) (22, 28) (22, 0) (1, 4) (1, 15) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 22) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (18, 29) (18, 19) (18, 24) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 21) (3, 13) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 3) (21, 24) (12, 20) (12, 16) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 23) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 22) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 5) (23, 16) (14, 20) (14, 25) (14, 5) (27, 6) (6, 25) (6, 27) (24, 9) (24, 18) (24, 21) (24, 13) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that fulfill the conditions of being a center node in a 3-star graph. 
Since a center node should have exactly three edges connected to it, we can identify them based on the number of incident edges. 
The nodes that can potentially be center nodes are: 4, 7, 20, 25, 10, 17, 8, 29, 19, 2, 9, 22, 1, 0, 15, 18, 5, 3, 21, 12, 16, 28, 11, 23, 14, 27, 6, 24, 13.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 1, 22)>
<7, (4, 0, 10)>
<20, (25, 22, 14)>
<25, (20, 6, 19)>
<10, (7, 21, 5)>
<17, (29, 3, 11)>
<8, (28, 15, 0)>
<29, (17, 11, 18)>
<19, (25, 5, 18)>
<2, (16, 3, 28)>
<9, (21, 24, 0)>
<22, (4, 20, 28)>
<1, (4, 15, 0)>
<0, (7, 9, 22)>
<15, (8, 1, 13)>
<18, (29, 19, 24)>
<5, (10, 19, 11)>
<3, (7, 17, 2)>
<21, (25, 10, 9)>
<12, (20, 16)>
<16, (2, 12, 23)>
<28, (8, 22)>
<11, (17, 29, 5)>
<23, (16)>
<14, (20, 25)>
<27, (6)>
<6, (25, 27)>
<24, (9, 18, 13)>
<13, (15, 3, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
