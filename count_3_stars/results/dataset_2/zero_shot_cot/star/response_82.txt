Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this graph. Let's list them:
<0, (6, 3, 12)>
<1, (8, 13, 2)>
<2, (2, 14, 5)>
<3, (13, 0, 12)>
<4, (4, 7, 10)>
<5, (8, 2, 1)>
<6, (6, 4, 12)>
<7, (7, 4, 10)>
<8, (8, 1, 5)>
<9, (9, 11, 7)>
<10, (10, 4, 7)>
<11, (11, 9, 0)>
<12, (12, 6, 3)>
<13, (13, 8, 0)>
<14, (14, 2, 0)>
There are a total of [14] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
