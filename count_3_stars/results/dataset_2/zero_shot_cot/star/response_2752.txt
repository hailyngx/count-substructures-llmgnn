Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which could form a 3-star.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars using the identified nodes:
- For Node 0: (0, 2, 7), (0, 3, 9) [2 3-stars]
- For Node 2: (2, 0, 9), (2, 7, 8) [2 3-stars]
- For Node 4: (4, 7, 9) [1 3-star]
- For Node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 8, 9) [2 3-stars]
- For Node 8: (8, 2, 5), (8, 6, 1) [2 3-stars]
- For Node 9: (9, 0, 3), (9, 2, 4) [2 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11] and they are:
<0, (2, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 9, 2)>, <2, (0, 9, 7)>, <2, (7, 8, 2)>, <4, (7, 9, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 6)>, <6, (8, 9, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (6, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 9)>.
