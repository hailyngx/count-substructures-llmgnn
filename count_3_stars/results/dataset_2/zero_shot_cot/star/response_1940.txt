Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 11) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-star configurations in the given graph. Since each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

From the provided edges, we can identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: Neighbors {3, 10, 11, 12}
- Node 1: Neighbors {9, 8, 13, 11, 2}
- Node 2: Neighbors {9, 13, 3, 1, 11}
- Node 3: Neighbors {4, 8, 0, 10, 2}
- Node 4: Neighbors {14, 6, 3, 7}
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 14}
- Node 6: Neighbors {9, 4, 10, 11}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9, 14, 13}
- Node 8: Neighbors {14, 3, 1}
- Node 9: Neighbors {6, 2, 1, 7}
- Node 10: Neighbors {6, 0, 3, 12}
- Node 11: Neighbors {6, 0, 1, 2}
- Node 12: Neighbors {0, 10, 14}
- Node 13: Neighbors {7, 2, 1, 0}
- Node 14: Neighbors {5, 4, 7, 8, 12}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars from the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- <0, (3, 10, 12)>
- <1, (9, 8, 13)>
- <2, (9, 13, 3)>
- <3, (4, 8, 0)>
- <4, (14, 6, 3)>
- <12, (0, 10, 14)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the answer is [6].
