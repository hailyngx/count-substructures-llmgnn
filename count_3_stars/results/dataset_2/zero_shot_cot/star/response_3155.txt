Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (creating a 3-star pattern). Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph and then count them.

The nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes are: 
- Node 0 (connected to 1, 3, 4)
- Node 2 (connected to 3, 7, 9)
- Node 5 (connected to 1, 4, 9)
- Node 6 (connected to 0, 4, 7)
- Node 8 (connected to 0, 1, 3)

From the above information, we can see that there are <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, and <8, (0, 1, 3)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
