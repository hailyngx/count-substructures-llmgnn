Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 12) (3, 18) (1, 11) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 4) (8, 9) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 5) (17, 15) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 11) (12, 3) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 19) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 19) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars:
<0, (6, 15, 18)>
<1, (11, 12, 15)>
<2, (5, 6, 17)>
<4, (6, 10, 15)>
<5, (2, 6, 17)>
<6, (0, 5, 7)>
<7, (9, 15, 19)>
<9, (5, 7, 19)>
<10, (4, 6, 15)>
<11, (1, 12, 16)>
<12, (11, 3, 18)>
<13, (6, 18, 19)>
<15, (1, 4, 7)>
<16, (11, 16, 18)>
<17, (2, 5, 15)>
<18, (0, 13, 16)>
<19, (0, 7, 13)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [16].
