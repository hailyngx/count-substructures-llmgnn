Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 2) (26, 9) (26, 22) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 17) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 29) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 29) (22, 26) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 11) (23, 22) (0, 21) (0, 8) (0, 13) (20, 4) (20, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 14) (12, 19) (19, 11) (19, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 15) (2, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 13) (8, 25) (28, 3) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (13, 0) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 6) (6, 22) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 13) (6, 27) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 27) (14, 12) (14, 5) (17, 7) (25, 8) (25, 29) (4, 10) (4, 20) (4, 24) (18, 16) (27, 6) (27, 16) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 29) (24, 10) (24, 4) (29, 10) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 9, 15)>
<3, (1, 5, 28)>
<4, (5, 10, 20)>
<5, (3, 4, 14)>
<6, (22, 13, 27)>
<7, (12, 17, 21)>
<8, (0, 13, 25)>
<9, (1, 2, 26)>
<10, (1, 4, 11)>
<11, (10, 19, 23)>
<12, (7, 14, 28)>
<13, (0, 6, 15)>
<14, (5, 12, 27)>
<15, (2, 13, 21)>
<16, (21, 27, 28)>
<17, (7, 21, 29)>
<18, (16, 22, 27)>
<19, (11, 12, 29)>
<20, (4, 6, 24)>
<21, (0, 7, 16)>
<22, (6, 9, 26)>
<23, (11, 22, 28)>
<24, (4, 10, 29)>
<25, (8, 25, 29)>
<26, (9, 22, 27)>
<27, (6, 14, 16)>
<28, (3, 12, 16)>
<29, (10, 17, 25)>

There are 29 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [29].
