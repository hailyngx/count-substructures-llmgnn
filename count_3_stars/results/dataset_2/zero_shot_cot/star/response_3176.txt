Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 15) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 17) (10, 4) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 17) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 3) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (14, 1) (16, 18) (16, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 15) (6, 8) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 14) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 6) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

<[1, (5, 9, 19)]>
<[3, (12, 7, 19)]>
<[4, (9, 8, 10)]>
<[7, (2, 3, 17)]>
<[9, (1, 5, 19)]>
<[13, (0, 11, 16)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
