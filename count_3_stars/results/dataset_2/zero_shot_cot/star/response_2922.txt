Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 25) (8, 22) (8, 7) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 23) (4, 18) (4, 22) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 1) (21, 10) (21, 26) (28, 1) (28, 27) (28, 20) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 3) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 19) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 26) (0, 9) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 15) (22, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 12) (23, 17) (23, 26) (23, 25) (23, 1) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 15) (9, 0) (9, 25) (9, 27) (24, 15) (25, 16) (25, 23) (25, 9) (25, 12) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 26) (15, 24) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 12) (19, 29) (19, 20) (27, 28) (27, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 22) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 7) (12, 14) (12, 25) (12, 6) (1, 18) (1, 28) (1, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph by checking which nodes have exactly three edges connected to them. Once we identify those central nodes, we can find the 3-stars associated with each of them.

The central nodes are: 14, 5, 18, 10, 26, and 0.

For central node 14:
- <14, (11, 10, 6)>
- <14, (11, 10, 12)>

For central node 5:
- <5, (11, 18, 0)>
- <5, (11, 18, 29)>
- <5, (11, 18, 7)>
- <5, (18, 1, 0)>
- <5, (18, 1, 7)>
- <5, (18, 1, 29)>
- <5, (0, 16, 15)>
- <5, (0, 16, 9)>
- <5, (0, 16, 26)>
- <5, (18, 4, 22)>

For central node 18:
- <18, (4, 22, 1)>
- <18, (4, 22, 5)>
- <18, (4, 22, 1)>

For central node 10:
- <10, (17, 21, 14)>
- <10, (17, 21, 26)>
- <10, (21, 26, 15)>
- <10, (21, 26, 23)>
- <10, (21, 26, 15)>

For central node 26:
- <26, (21, 0, 15)>
- <26, (21, 0, 23)>
- <26, (21, 0, 15)>
- <26, (0, 16, 15)>
- <26, (0, 16, 9)>
- <26, (0, 16, 5)>
- <26, (23, 25, 1)>
- <26, (23, 25, 1)>
- <26, (23, 25, 9)>
- <26, (15, 22, 24)>
  
For central node 0:
- <0, (16, 15, 9)>
- <0, (16, 15, 26)>
- <0, (16, 15, 5)>
- <0, (26, 21, 15)>
- <0, (26, 21, 23)>
- <0, (26, 21, 15)>
- <0, (15, 16, 26)>
- <0, (15, 16, 9)>
- <0, (15, 16, 5)>
- <0, (15, 22, 24)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].
