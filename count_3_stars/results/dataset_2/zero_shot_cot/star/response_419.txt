Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of our 3-stars.

The nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 2, 6, 8, and 13.

Now, let's find the leaves of the 3-stars by looking at the nodes connected to each center node.

For node 2:
Leaves connected to node 2: 7, 8, 13, 12, 0
<2, (7, 8, 13)>
<2, (7, 8, 12)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>
<2, (7, 13, 12)>
<2, (7, 13, 0)>
<2, (8, 13, 12)>
<2, (8, 13, 0)>
<2, (13, 12, 0)>

For node 6:
Leaves connected to node 6: 4, 7, 13, 12
<6, (4, 7, 13)>
<6, (4, 7, 12)>
<6, (4, 13, 12)>
<6, (7, 13, 12)>

For node 8:
Leaves connected to node 8: 7, 2, 11, 12
<8, (7, 2, 11)>
<8, (7, 2, 12)>
<8, (7, 11, 12)>
<8, (2, 11, 12)>

For node 13:
Leaves connected to node 13: 2, 6, 10, 11
<13, (2, 6, 10)>
<13, (2, 6, 11)>
<13, (2, 10, 11)>
<13, (6, 10, 11)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
