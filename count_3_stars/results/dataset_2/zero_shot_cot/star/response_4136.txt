Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (3, 6, 11)>
<3, (1, 2, 0)>
<10, (11, 0, 7)>
<11, (1, 10, 13)>
<13, (5, 11, 8)>
<6, (1, 13, 14)>
<0, (5, 1, 10)>
<14, (6, 0, 12)>
<7, (5, 9, 10)>
<12, (9, 13, 14)>
<4, (9, 6, 14)>
<2, (9, 3, 11)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [14]
