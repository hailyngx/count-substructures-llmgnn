Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 11) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph, which consist of a center node connected to three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <4, (9, 8, 5)>
2. <7, (0, 1, 14)>
3. <9, (4, 14, 12)>
4. <5, (4, 8, 12)>
5. <11, (12, 5, 13)>
6. <3, (4, 7, 10)>
7. <2, (5, 1, 3)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found, which is 7 in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
