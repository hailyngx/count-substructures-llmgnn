Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 15) (9, 13) (9, 1) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 27) (1, 9) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 8) (2, 26) (2, 29) (2, 27) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 3) (29, 18) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 18) (0, 29) (0, 20) (0, 25) (20, 26) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 14) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 28) (6, 21) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (28, 1) (28, 5) (28, 8) (3, 29) (3, 24) (3, 12) (11, 23) (11, 7) (7, 11) (7, 25) (7, 15) (25, 0) (25, 7) (25, 12) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 19) (8, 21) (8, 28) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 4) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 25) (16, 27) (15, 22) (15, 7) (15, 19) (18, 29) (18, 23) (14, 13) (14, 20) (14, 6) (24, 5) (24, 3) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 2) (27, 26) (27, 2) (27, 16) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing and analyzing the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 13 is connected to nodes 22, 10, and 9.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 13, 23, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 13, 1, and 26.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 20.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 26, and 21.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 26, 29, and 10.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 2, 0, and 3.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 22, 11, and 18.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 29, 20, and 25.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 26, 0, and 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 21, 5, and 17.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 29, 24, and 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 23, 7, and 18.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 25, and 15.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 12.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 20, 6, and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 21, 28, and 17.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 17, 15, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 19.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 25.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 27.

Looking at the connections, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
- <13, (22, 10, 9)>
- <26, (1, 2, 20)>
- <21, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (26, 29, 10)>
- <29, (2, 0, 3)>
- <23, (22, 11, 18)>
- <0, (29, 20, 25)>
- <6, (21, 5, 17)>
- <28, (1, 5, 8)>
- <11, (23, 7, 18)>
- <7, (11, 25, 15)>
- <17, (20, 6, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
