Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 0) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 3) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 11) (6, 5) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 13) (1, 19) (15, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 4) (17, 5) (17, 13) (16, 5) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 3) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 3) (4, 13) (4, 19) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (16, 5, 8)>
<3, (12, 14, 19)>
<5, (16, 17, 18)>
<8, (0, 5, 2)>
<13, (0, 4, 17)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
