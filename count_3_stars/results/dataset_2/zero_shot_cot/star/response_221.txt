Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the same node as leaves to form a potential 3-star.

- Node 1: Connected to nodes 9 and 10, making a potential 3-star with leaves 9, 10, and 1.
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 10 and 26, making a potential 3-star with leaves 10, 26, and 2.
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 12 and 29, making a potential 3-star with leaves 12, 29, and 3.
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9 and 16, making a potential 3-star with leaves 9, 16, and 4.
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 12 and 24, making a potential 3-star with leaves 12, 24, and 5.
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, forming a 3-star with leaves 9 and 6.
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 0 and 19, forming a 3-star with leaves 0 and 19, and center 7.
- Node 8: Connected to node 14, 23, and 11, forming potential 3-stars with leaves 14, 23, and 8, and leaves 11, 23, and 8.
- Node 9: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 10: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 11: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 12: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 0 and 18, making a potential 3-star with leaves 0, 18, and 13.
- Node 14: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 15: Connected to node 19, forming a 3-star with leaves 15, 19, and center 19.
- Node 16: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 17: Connected to node 24, forming a 3-star with leaves 17, 24, and center 24.
- Node 18: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 19: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 20: Connected to node 27, forming a 3-star with leaves 20, 27, and center 27.
- Node 21: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 22: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 23: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 24: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 25: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 26: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 27: Already counted in previous steps.
- Node 28: Connected to node 23, forming a 3-star with leaves 23, 28, and center 28.
- Node 29: Already counted in previous steps.

Therefore, the 3-stars that can be formed in the given graph are:
<0, 13, 18>, <0, 18, 25>, <1, 9, 10>, <2, 10, 26>, <3, 12, 29>, <4, 9, 16>, <5, 12, 24>, <7, (0, 19)>, <8, 11, 23>, <8, 14, 23>, <12, 24, 5>, <14, 20, 8>, <14, 8, 23>, <15, 19, (19)>, <17, 24, (24)>, <20, 27, (27)>, <23, 28, (28)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
