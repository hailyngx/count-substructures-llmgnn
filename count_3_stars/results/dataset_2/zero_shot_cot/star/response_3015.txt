Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 19) (22, 11) (22, 17) (22, 25) (22, 8) (9, 26) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 27) (26, 0) (0, 26) (0, 27) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 15) (27, 11) (15, 9) (15, 27) (15, 23) (8, 22) (8, 21) (23, 15) (23, 7) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 25) (17, 22) (17, 3) (29, 1) (29, 3) (2, 0) (2, 19) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 28) (18, 21) (18, 3) (16, 13) (28, 18) (21, 8) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 11) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 29) (3, 17) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 14) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) (14, 3) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 19) (7, 9) (7, 23) (7, 20) (20, 7) (20, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 20) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 25) (24, 10) (11, 22) (11, 27) (11, 21) (11, 6) (25, 22) (25, 26) (25, 10) (25, 19) 

Response:
First, identify which nodes can be the center of a 3-star graph. To be a center, a node must have exactly three edges connected to it. 

Nodes with exactly three edges: 8, 15, 16, 24, 28

Now, for each potential center, find the nodes that are connected to it by edges. These will be the leaves of the 3-star. 

For node 8: (8, 22, 21), (8, 22, 11)
For node 15: (15, 9, 27), (15, 9, 23)
For node 16: (16, 13, 19)
For node 24: (24, 10, 25)
For node 28: (28, 18, 21)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (22, 21, 11)>, <15, (9, 27, 23)>, <16, (13, 19, -)>, <24, (10, 25, -)>, <28, (18, 21, -)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
