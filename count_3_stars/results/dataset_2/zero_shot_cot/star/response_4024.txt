Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly three edges connecting it to three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 6, 10)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 13)>
<9, (10, 12, 14)>
