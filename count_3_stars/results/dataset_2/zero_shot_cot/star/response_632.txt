Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges. These nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star graph.

Nodes with 3 edges: 7, 3, 6, 0, 9, 2

Now, let's check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star graph.

For node 7:
- (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) forms a 3-star <7, (4, 5, 6)>

For node 3:
- (3,1), (3,5), (3,8) forms a 3-star <3, (1, 5, 8)>
- (3,7), (3,9), (3,2) forms a 3-star <3, (7, 9, 2)>

For node 6:
- (6,1), (6,8), (6,5) forms a 3-star <6, (1, 8, 5)>
- (6,7), (6,1), (6,2) forms a 3-star <6, (7, 1, 2)>

For node 0:
- (0,1), (0,8), (0,2) forms a 3-star <0, (1, 8, 2)>

For node 9:
- (9,1), (9,3), (9,7) forms a 3-star <9, (1, 3, 7)>

For node 2:
- (2,1), (2,3), (2,6) forms a 3-star <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- (2,0), (2,3), (2,6) forms a 3-star <2, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is 7.
