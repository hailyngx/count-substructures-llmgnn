Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 5) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 18) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (17, 15) (17, 12) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star. Nodes connected to other nodes by only one edge are the potential center nodes.

The potential center nodes are: 0, 6, 11, 13, 17

Next, we identify the neighboring nodes for each potential central node to see if they form 3-star structures. 

- For node 0: (0, 15), (0, 10)
- For node 6: (6, 18)
- For node 11: (11, 8)
- For node 13: (13, 10), (13, 12)
- For node 17: (17, 15), (17, 12)

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (15, 10)>
<6, 18>
<11, 8>
<13, (10, 12)>
<17, (15, 12)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
