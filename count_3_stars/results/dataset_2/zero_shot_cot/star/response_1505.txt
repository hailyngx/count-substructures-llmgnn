Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 6) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each identified node, check if it forms a 3-star pattern with its adjacent nodes.

Here are the steps for finding the 3-stars:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0: Connected to nodes 10, 7, 6
   - Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 3, (Not connected to exactly 3 nodes, disregard)

2. 3-star patterns:
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star pattern: <0, (10, 7, 6)>
   - Node 7 forms a 3-star pattern: <7, (12, 0, 14)>
   - Node 12 forms a 3-star pattern: <12, (11, 7, 2)>
   - Node 1 does not form a 3-star pattern.
   - Node 3 does not form a 3-star pattern.

Count of 3-stars: [3]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (10, 7, 6)>, <7, (12, 0, 14)>, <12, (11, 7, 2)>
