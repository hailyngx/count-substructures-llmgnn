Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Upon careful examination of the edges, we can find the following 3-star graphs:

<0, (6, 11, 14)>
<1, (10, 12, 14)>
<2, (6, 9, 13)>
<3, (5, 6, 13)>
<4, (2, 8, 11)>
<5, (3, 12, 14)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (9, 10, 14)>
<8, (2, 4, 11)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<10, (1, 7, 14)>
<11, (0, 4, 8)>
<12, (1, 5, 9)>
<13, (2, 3, 11)>
<14, (0, 1, 7)>

There are a total of [14] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
