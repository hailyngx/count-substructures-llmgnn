Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 8) (29, 3) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (20, 26) (20, 11) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 16) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 1) (28, 11) (28, 23) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (4, 27) (4, 12) (4, 15) (27, 25) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 17) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 5) (22, 2) (22, 8) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 23) (14, 27) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 24) (26, 20) (26, 10) (26, 7) (18, 9) (18, 27) (16, 6) (16, 25) (16, 17) (16, 23) (24, 10) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 26) (17, 27) (17, 16) (17, 21) (23, 28) (23, 12) (23, 16) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (19, 3) (19, 0) (13, 25) (13, 3) (13, 15) (5, 15) (5, 21) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 22) (8, 0) (21, 17) (21, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
1: (11, 12, 15)
2: (10, 22, 29)
3: (11, 13, 19, 29)
4: (12, 15, 27)
5: (15, 21)
6: (8, 16)
7: (10, 26, 29)
8: (0, 6, 8, 22)
9: (0, 12, 18)
10: (2, 7, 10, 24, 26)
11: (1, 3, 20, 28)
12: (1, 4, 9, 23)
13: (3, 15, 25)
14: (27)
15: (1, 4, 13)
16: (6, 16, 17, 23, 25)
17: (16, 21, 27)
18: (9, 27)
19: (0, 3)
20: (11, 26)
21: (5, 17)
22: (2, 8)
23: (12, 16, 28)
24: (10)
25: (13, 16, 27)
26: (10, 20)
27: (4, 14, 17, 18, 25)
28: (11, 23)
29: (2, 7, 29)
Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
[<5, (15, 1, 21)>, <10, (26, 2, 7)>, <20, (26, 11, 20)>, <23, (28, 11, 23)>]
