Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 0) (15, 18) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 18) (10, 3) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 1) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 2) (19, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

<Node, (Leaves)>
<0, (15, 18, 13)>
<1, (13, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 19)>
<3, (12, 7, 10)>
<4, (5, 19, 1)>
<5, (6, 2, 0)>
<6, (5, 2, 0)>
<7, (11, 12, 14)>
<8, (9, 1, 13)>
<9, (11, 8, 17)>
<10, (3, 12, 7)>
<11, (7, 9, 17)>
<12, (3, 7, 13)>
<13, (12, 1, 18)>
<14, (7, 12, 1)>
<15, (0, 18, 3)>
<17, (3, 9, 11)>
<18, (15, 13, 3)>
<19, (5, 4, 2)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
