Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 20) (1, 10) (1, 23) (1, 7) (21, 16) (21, 15) (2, 3) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 14) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 11) (12, 23) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 19) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (0, 8) (0, 26) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 23) (17, 8) (17, 25) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 29) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 28) (19, 27) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 20) (22, 16) (22, 19) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 28) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 3) (6, 23) (20, 9) (20, 12) (20, 19) (14, 29) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 15) (18, 14) (24, 4) (24, 17) (24, 14) (3, 2) (3, 27) (3, 4) (3, 26) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 15) (13, 10) (13, 11) (23, 1) (23, 12) (23, 16) (23, 6) (28, 25) (28, 10) (15, 21) (15, 14) (15, 11) (7, 1) (7, 27) 

Response:
First, identify the nodes with degree 3. These nodes will serve as the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Then, identify the neighbors of each of these central nodes to form the 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3: 5, 9, 12, 14, 25, 27

Now, let's list the 3-stars:

<5, (9, 10, 11)>
<9, (5, 20, 25)>
<12, (11, 20, 23)>
<14, (4, 15, 29)>
<25, (9, 17, 29)>
<27, (3, 7, 19)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 6. Therefore, the answer is [6].
