Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (9, 8, 1)>
2. <9, (5, 7, 8)>
3. <4, (7, 8, 5)>
4. <7, (9, 4, 3)>
5. <1, (5, 3, 6)>
6. <3, (7, 1, 8)>
7. <8, (9, 5, 4)>
8. <6, (5, 7, 1)>
9. <2, (8, 0, 0)>
10. <0, (5, 7, 3)>

Since there are 10 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
