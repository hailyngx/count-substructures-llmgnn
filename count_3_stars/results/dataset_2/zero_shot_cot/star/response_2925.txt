Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 21) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 23) (1, 22) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 22) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 27) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 27) (0, 17) (0, 2) (20, 26) (20, 24) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 28) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 17) (18, 25) (7, 16) (7, 23) (12, 15) (12, 26) (26, 20) (26, 12) (26, 24) (28, 5) (28, 2) (24, 20) (24, 26) (24, 22) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 4) (4, 15) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 23) (21, 9) (21, 22) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 19) (29, 1) (29, 15) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 15) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 14) (14, 27) (19, 13) (19, 6) (19, 23) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 22) (23, 1) (23, 7) (23, 16) (23, 19) (22, 1) (22, 3) (22, 24) (22, 21) (22, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 29, 23, 22, and 18.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 13, 0, 18, and 28.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 28, and 16.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 18.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 25, and 21.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 15, 6, and 27.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 2, and 19.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 12, 25, 29, and 4.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 23.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 8, 2, 17, and 25.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 13, 6, and 23.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 26 and 24.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 9 and 22.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 24, 21, and 17.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 1, 7, 16, 19, and 22.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 20, 26, 22, and 14.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 9, 18, 15, and 15.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 20, 12, 24, and 14.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 14.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 5.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 1 and 15.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (3, 22, 18)>
- <2, (13, 0, 18)>
- <5, (9, 28, 16)>
- <6, (3, 10, 19)>
- <8, (13, 11, 18)>
- <9, (5, 25, 21)>
- <10, (11, 15, 6)>
- <13, (8, 2, 19)>
- <15, (10, 12, 25)>
- <16, (5, 7, 23)>
- <18, (1, 8, 17)>
- <19, (13, 6, 23)>
- <20, (26, 24, 14)>
- <21, (9, 22)>
- <22, (1, 3, 24)>
- <23, (1, 7, 16)>
- <24, (20, 26, 22)>
- <25, (9, 18, 15)>
- <26, (20, 12, 24)>
- <27, (10, 11, 14)>
- <28, (5, 2, 5)>
- <29, (1, 15)>

There are 21 unique 3-stars in the given graph, thus the answer is [21].
