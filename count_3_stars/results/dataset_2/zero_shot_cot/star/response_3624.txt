Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>.
