Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 11) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 13) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 16) (1, 9) (1, 12) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 5) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 3) (4, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 5) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 5) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 11.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 17.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 19.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 18.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 14.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 18.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 15.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 19.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 1.

Counting these unique 3-stars gives:
- <6, (2, 8, 11)>
- <13, (0, 8, 11)>
- <10, (7, 12, 17)>
- <17, (2, 7, 19)>
- <11, (2, 5, 18)>
- <7, (5, 10, 14)>
- <15, (5, 7, 18)>
- <5, (7, 11, 15)>
- <3, (0, 4, 19)>
- <16, (9, 14, 5)>
- <1, (9, 12, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
