Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 2)>
2. <1, (0, 3, 4)>
3. <2, (0, 5, 9)>
4. <3, (1, 0, 5)>
5. <4, (1, 5, 9)>
6. <5, (2, 0, 4)>
7. <6, (1, 7, 8)>
8. <7, (9, 3, 6)>
9. <8, (1, 0, 6)>
10. <9, (1, 7, 4)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
