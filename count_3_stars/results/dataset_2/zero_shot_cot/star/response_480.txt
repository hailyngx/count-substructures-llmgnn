Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Given the edges provided, we can construct the following unique 3-stars:

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 6)>
<1, (4, 3, 2)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 1)>
<0, (9, 4, 8)>

Thus, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
