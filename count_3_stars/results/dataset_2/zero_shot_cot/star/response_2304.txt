Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 6) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 9) (8, 19) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 12) (19, 6) (19, 15) (19, 8) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 7) (16, 12) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 18) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 16) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we will look for nodes that have 3 edges connected to them, which will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (0, 7, 13)>
<3, (6, 12, 17)>
<5, (6, 7, 15)>
<6, (3, 5, 19)>
<9, (4, 15, 17)>
<10, (0, 11, 16)>
<11, (4, 10, 14)>
<12, (3, 13, 16)>
<14, (2, 11, 18)>
<15, (5, 9, 19)>
<16, (10, 12, 7)>
<17, (3, 9, 12)>
<18, (2, 6, 14)>
<19, (6, 8, 15)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
