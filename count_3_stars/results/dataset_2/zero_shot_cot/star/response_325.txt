Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 11) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 16) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 7) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (14, 11) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 0) (12, 1) (12, 0) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <1, (12, 0, 7)>
2. <2, (10, 4, 11)>
3. <3, (13, 6, 15)>
4. <4, (10, 2, 17)>
5. <5, (0, 11, 16)>
6. <6, (8, 3, 16)>
7. <7, (1, 11, 0)>
8. <8, (13, 6, 1)>
9. <10, (2, 4, 1)>
10. <11, (7, 5, 2)>
11. <12, (1, 0, 7)>
12. <13, (8, 16, 3)>
13. <15, (6, 3, 5)>
14. <16, (19, 6, 5)>
15. <17, (2, 0, 4)>
16. <18, (19, 0, 0)>
17. <19, (18, 16, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
