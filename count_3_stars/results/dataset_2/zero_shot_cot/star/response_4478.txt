Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 16) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 17) (11, 29) (11, 20) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (22, 27) (22, 21) (5, 6) (5, 15) (5, 20) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 13) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 28) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 12) (4, 18) (4, 19) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 21) (7, 18) (7, 29) (7, 15) (25, 14) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 9) (23, 26) (23, 13) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 21) (26, 16) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 13) (9, 10) (9, 0) (14, 25) (28, 2) (28, 0) (21, 22) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 26) (15, 5) (15, 7) (19, 6) (19, 4) (19, 24) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 16) (12, 10) (12, 8) (24, 19) (24, 27) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 26) (16, 27) (13, 6) (13, 23) (13, 29) (13, 20) (20, 11) (20, 5) (20, 13) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 17, 10)>
<3, (8, 16, 18)>
<10, (0, 11, 12)>
<11, (17, 20, 29)>
<18, (4, 7, 16)>
<22, (21, 27, 0)>
<5, (6, 15, 20)>
<6, (13, 19, 5)>
<2, (1, 8, 28)>
<8, (2, 3, 12)>
<4, (18, 19, 24)>
<17, (1, 11, 21)>
<7, (15, 18, 29)>
<25, (14, 0, 27)>
<0, (1, 9, 28)>
<23, (13, 26, 29)>
<26, (16, 17, 21)>
<29, (0, 7, 11)>
<9, (0, 10, 28)>
<14, (25, 0, 13)>
<28, (0, 2, 9)>
<24, (19, 27, 4)>
<16, (3, 18, 26)>
<13, (6, 20, 23)>
<20, (11, 13, 5)>
