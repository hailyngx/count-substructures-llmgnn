Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 24) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 6) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 19) (10, 9) (10, 24) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 2) (28, 13) (28, 1) (29, 7) (17, 8) (17, 19) (17, 22) (26, 20) (26, 5) (26, 6) (4, 27) (4, 21) (4, 15) (27, 4) (27, 19) (6, 13) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 22) (21, 4) (21, 6) (21, 5) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 3) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 7) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 7) (18, 20) (18, 9) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 15) (24, 25) (24, 10) (24, 16) (24, 22) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 13) (1, 28) (1, 16) (0, 12) (0, 15) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 0) (22, 17) (22, 6) (22, 24) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 16) (3, 19) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 27) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 20: (18, 25, 26)
- Node 25: (12, 20, 24)
- Node 8: (11, 14, 17)
- Node 13: (1, 6, 28)
- Node 23: (11, 19, 8)
- Node 10: (9, 24, 25)
- Node 4: (15, 21, 27)
- Node 6: (13, 21, 26)
- Node 5: (3, 21, 26)
- Node 2: (3, 11, 12)
- Node 9: (7, 10, 18)
- Node 16: (1, 3, 24)
- Node 0: (12, 15, 16)
- Node 22: (6, 17, 24)
- Node 7: (9, 14, 29)
- Node 1: (13, 16, 28)
- Node 15: (0, 4, 16)
- Node 3: (2, 5, 16)
- Node 19: (17, 23, 27)
- Node 14: (7, 11, 8)
- Node 18: (9, 20, 22)
- Node 24: (10, 16, 22)
- Node 27: (4, 19, 27)
- Node 11: (2, 8, 23)
- Node 28: (1, 13, 28)
- Node 26: (5, 6, 20)
- Node 21: (4, 5, 6)
- Node 12: (2, 25, 0)
- Node 17: (14, 19, 22)
- Node 29: (7, 14, 9)

Based on the identified 3-stars in the graph, the total number of 3-stars is [29].
