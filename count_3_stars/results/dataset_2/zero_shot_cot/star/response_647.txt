Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5, 9, and 6 as they can potentially form 3-stars.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 3, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 1, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 4, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <5, (9, 6, 4)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <6, (5, 9, 7)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we have [3].
