Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (2, 1, 10)>
<9, (4, 2, 14)>
<4, (7, 8, 10)>
<7, (12, 4, -)>
<10, (5, 4, 12)>
<11, (10, 1, 6)>
<8, (4, 11, 0)>
<13, (5, 10, -)>
<12, (7, 10, 3)>
<1, (5, 11, 6)>
<6, (11, 8, 1)>
<3, (8, 12, 14)>
<0, (9, 8, 6)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars.
