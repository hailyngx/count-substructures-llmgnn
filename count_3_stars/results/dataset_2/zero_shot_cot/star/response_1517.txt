Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 13) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 17) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (6, 18) (6, 16) 

Response:
There are some nodes with degree 3, meaning they are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify those nodes first:

- Node 5: (5, 12), (5, 18), (5, 7), (5, 14)
- Node 18: (18, 5), (18, 2), (18, 15), (18, 6), (18, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 18), (2, 0), (2, 15)
- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 16), (0, 15), (0, 11), (0, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 0), (1, 12)
- Node 4: (4, 17), (4, 3)
- Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 11), (3, 19)
- Node 9: (9, 11), (9, 12)
- Node 14: (14, 5), (14, 13)
- Node 6: (6, 18), (6, 16)

Now, we can see the 3-stars in the graph:

[10]
<5, (12, 18, 7)>
<18, (2, 15, 6)>
<2, (0, 18, 15)>
<0, (2, 16, 15)>
<1, (0, 12, 11)>
<4, (17, 3, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 18)>
<3, (4, 11, 19)>
<9, (11, 12, 5)>
<14, (5, 13, 14)>
<6, (18, 16, 6)>
