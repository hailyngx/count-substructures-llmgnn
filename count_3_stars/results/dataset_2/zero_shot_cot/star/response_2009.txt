Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

The 3-star patterns in the graph are as follows:
<5, (9, 8, 7)>
<6, (5, 3, 2)>
<10, (11, 0, 12)>
<11, (10, 8, 2)>
<4, (6, 13, 14)>
<12, (6, 10, 7)>
<3, (6, 0, 13)>

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
