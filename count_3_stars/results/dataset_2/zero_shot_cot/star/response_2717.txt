Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's start by listing the 3-stars:

<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 3)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
