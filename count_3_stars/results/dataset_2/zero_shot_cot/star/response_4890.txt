Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. Nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them can be considered as potential centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 0)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 9, 4, 1, 3, 0)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 9, 7, 8, 2)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 9, 4, 3, 1)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 1: <1, (5, 6, 7)>
- From node 2: <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 3, 0)>
- From node 3: No 3-stars as center node 3 only has 4 edges.
- From node 8: <8, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph, which are <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (9, 4, 1)>, <2, (9, 3, 0)>, <8, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (9, 3, 2)>.
