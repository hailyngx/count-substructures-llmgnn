Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (19, 16) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 1) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 11) (2, 11) (2, 1) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 6) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first find all the 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<5, (17, 16, 14)>
<9, (15, 17, 13)>
<8, (13, 10, 7)>
<13, (9, 8, 17)>
<10, (8, 17, 12)>
<17, (5, 9, 13)>
<4, (13, 3, 6)>
<18, (14, 16, 3)>
<3, (4, 18, 11)>
<11, (3, 14, 6)>
<7, (8, 3, 0)>
<1, (15, 2, 12)>
<6, (4, 11, 12)>

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
