Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (6, 9, 0)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>

Therefore, there are [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
