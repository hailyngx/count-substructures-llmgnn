Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 17) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 6) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 10) (6, 1) (6, 19) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 18) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 2) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 2) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 17) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars first and then count them.

<0, (4, 7, 10)>
<1, (6, 15, 19)>
<2, (3, 17, 19)>
<3, (2, 8, 18)>
<4, (0, 7, 11)>
<5, (7, 14, 15)>
<6, (1, 19, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 10)>
<8, (3, 10, 13)>
<9, (7, 11, 18)>
<10, (0, 7, 14)>
<11, (4, 9, 15)>
<12, (13, 14, 17)>
<13, (8, 12, 14)>
<14, (5, 10, 13)>
<15, (1, 11, 19)>
<16, (0, 17, 16)>
<17, (2, 16, 19)>
<18, (3, 9, 19)>
<19, (6, 15, 18)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
