Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 10) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 15) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (6, 8) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 12) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) 

Response:
We first identify the nodes connected to the central node of each 3-star. 
Since each 3-star has 3 leaves, we look for nodes with exactly 3 incident edges.

Nodes meeting that condition: 1, 16, 17, 12

Next, we form 3-stars with each of these nodes as the center. 

For node 1:
- Leaves: 2, 13, 17
- The 3-star: <1, (2, 13, 17)>

For node 16:
- Leaves: 2, 8, 9
- The 3-star: <16, (2, 8, 9)>

For node 17:
- Leaves: 4, 12, 9
- The 3-star: <17, (4, 12, 9)>

For node 12:
- Leaves: 8, 13, 17
- The 3-star: <12, (8, 13, 17)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
