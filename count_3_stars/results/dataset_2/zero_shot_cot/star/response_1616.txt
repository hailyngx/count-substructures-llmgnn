Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 23) (21, 24) (21, 13) (21, 29) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 23) (6, 26) (9, 22) (9, 12) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (13, 21) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (2, 17) (2, 16) (18, 10) (18, 29) (7, 23) (7, 27) (12, 9) (12, 8) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 27) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 5) (26, 6) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 20) (28, 1) (28, 26) (3, 0) (3, 19) (11, 14) (11, 24) (4, 13) (4, 27) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 16) (25, 17) (25, 29) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 7) (0, 13) (0, 3) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 29) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 16) (20, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 5) (29, 21) (29, 8) (29, 18) (29, 25) (29, 15) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 27) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node to find the potential 3-stars.

Node 0: {3, 13}
Node 1: {6, 23, 28}
Node 2: {16, 17}
Node 3: {0, 19}
Node 4: {13, 27}
Node 5: {10, 13, 20, 22}
Node 6: {1, 14, 23, 26}
Node 7: {23, 27}
Node 8: {10, 12, 13, 18, 29}
Node 9: {12, 22}
Node 10: {5, 8, 18}
Node 11: {14, 24}
Node 12: {8, 9}
Node 13: {0, 4, 5, 8, 21}
Node 14: {6, 11, 17, 19}
Node 15: {19, 26, 29}
Node 16: {2, 14, 19, 27}
Node 17: {2, 14, 25}
Node 18: {8, 10, 29}
Node 19: {3, 14, 15, 16}
Node 20: {5}
Node 21: {13, 24, 29}
Node 22: {5, 9, 26}
Node 23: {1, 6, 7}
Node 24: {11, 21, 27}
Node 25: {17, 29}
Node 26: {6, 15, 22, 28}
Node 27: {4, 7, 16, 24}
Node 28: {1, 26}
Node 29: {8, 15, 18, 21, 25}

Now, let's find all the 3-stars:

<5, (13, 22, 10)>
<8, (13, 0, 5)>
<13, (0, 5, 8)>
<14, (6, 17, 19)>
<15, (19, 26, 29)>
<16, (2, 19, 27)>
<17, (2, 14, 25)>
<19, (3, 14, 16)>
<21, (13, 24, 29)>
<26, (6, 15, 22)>
<29, (8, 18, 25)>

There are total [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
