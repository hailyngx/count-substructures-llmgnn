Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<4, (9, 3, 6)>
<7, (9, 8, 3)>
<1, (9, 6, 2)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 4, 1)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (6, 8, 0)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
