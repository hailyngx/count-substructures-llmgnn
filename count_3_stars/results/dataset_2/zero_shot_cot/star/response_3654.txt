Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 12) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 11) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by counting the number of neighbors each node has and finding the ones that have 3 neighbors connected to them. 

Let's start by listing the degrees of each node:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 4
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 5
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 3
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 3
Node 12: 5
Node 13: 4
Node 14: 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (7, 3, 10)>
<3, (7, 1, 14)>
<4, (7, 8, 12)>
<5, (4, 6, 12)>
<9, (6, 2, 0)>
<11, (1, 13, 0)>
<13, (8, 11, 14)>
<14, (3, 13, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
