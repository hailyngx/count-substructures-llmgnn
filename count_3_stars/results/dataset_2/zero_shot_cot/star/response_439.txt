Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to locate all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step.

1. Node 0:
   - (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 10), (0, 1)

2. Node 1:
   - (1, 8), (1, 0), (1, 10), (1, 5), (1, 4)

3. Node 2:
   - (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 13), (2, 14)

4. Node 3:
   - (3, 7), (3, 11), (3, 4)

5. Node 4:
   - (4, 6), (4, 14), (4, 3), (4, 10), (4, 1)

6. Node 5:
   - (5, 12), (5, 8), (5, 1)

7. Node 6:
   - (6, 10), (6, 2), (6, 4)

8. Node 7:
   - (7, 9), (7, 12), (7, 3), (7, 8)

9. Node 8:
   - (8, 7), (8, 12), (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 0), (8, 1)

10. Node 9:
    - (9, 13), (9, 7), (9, 0)

11. Node 10:
    - (10, 6), (10, 0), (10, 14), (10, 1), (10, 4), (10, 13)

12. Node 11:
    - (11, 14), (11, 3)

13. Node 12:
    - (12, 7), (12, 13), (12, 5),(12, 8)

14. Node 13:
    - (13, 9), (13, 12), (13, 2), (13, 10)

15. Node 14:
    - (14, 2), (14, 11), (14, 4), (14, 10)

Based on the connections, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (9, 8, 1)>
<1, (8, 7, 5)>
<2, (6, 8, 13)>
<3, (7, 12, 4)>
<4, (6, 14, 10)>
<5, (12, 8, 1)>
<6, (10, 2, 4)>
<7, (9, 12, 3)>
<8, (7, 12, 2)>
<9, (13, 12, 2)>
<10, (14, 13, 2)>
<11, (14, 3, 11)>
<12, (5, 8, 1)>
<13, (9, 12, 7)>
<14, (11, 3, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
