Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 19) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 14) (18, 22) (18, 6) (18, 12) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 13) (25, 26) (25, 23) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 1) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 15) (8, 21) (8, 6) (8, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (7, 17) (15, 16) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 5) (9, 23) (29, 5) (29, 21) (3, 8) (3, 21) (3, 6) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 24) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 18) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 3) (6, 1) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 2) (19, 22) (19, 24) (19, 27) (10, 27) (27, 19) (27, 10) (27, 17) (14, 16) (14, 1) (4, 11) (4, 23) (17, 7) (17, 27) (17, 28) (17, 5) (28, 20) (28, 17) (28, 24) (28, 5) (24, 21) (24, 19) (24, 28) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 9) (23, 4) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 17) (5, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. 

Let's list all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 12, 16)>
<1, (0, 6, 14)>
<2, (12, 15, 26)>
<3, (6, 8, 21)>
<4, (5, 11, 23)>
<5, (4, 17, 28)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 21)>
<11, (4, 5, 16)>
<12, (0, 2, 16)>
<15, (2, 5, 16)>
<16, (0, 11, 15)>
<17, (4, 5, 28)>
<18, (6, 12, 22)>
<19, (17, 24, 27)>
<21, (3, 8, 24)>
<22, (18, 19, 25)>
<23, (4, 9, 25)>
<24, (19, 21, 28)>
<25, (13, 22, 26)>
<26, (2, 15, 25)>
<27, (10, 17, 19)>
<28, (5, 17, 24)>
<29, (5, 21, 22)>

We found 24 unique 3-stars in the graph. Hence, the final answer is [24].
