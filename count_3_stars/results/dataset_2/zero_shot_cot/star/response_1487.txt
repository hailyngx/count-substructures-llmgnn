Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 2) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 1) (1, 8) (1, 19) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (4, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 15) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 15) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 15) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<8, (7, 1, 6)>
<13, (16, 3, 0)>
<10, (12, 5, 11)>
<17, (15, 4, 19)>
<12, (16, 18, 15)>
<16, (8, 13, 14)>
<6, (8, 19, 0)>
<11, (19, 5, 2)>
<19, (6, 11, 4)>
<1, (8, 19, 0)>
<2, (11, 4, 3)>
<4, (17, 19, 3)>
<9, (14, 7, 15)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
