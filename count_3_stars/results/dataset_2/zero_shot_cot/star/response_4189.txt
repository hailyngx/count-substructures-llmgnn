Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can focus on each node and its neighbors. A 3-star is formed when a node has exactly three neighbors, and each of these neighbors is not directly connected to each other.

Let's examine each node and its neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 18
  - No 3-star centered at Node 0.

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 13, 15, 23
  - <1, (3, 13, 15)>

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4, 18
  - No 3-star centered at Node 2.

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 13, 15
  - <3, (1, 13, 15)>

- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 10, 11
  - No 3-star centered at Node 4.

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 20
  - <5, (0, 7, 20)>

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 25, 26, 28, 29
  - No 3-star centered at Node 6.

- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 5, 12, 20, 22, 29
  - No 3-star centered at Node 7.

- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 0, 17
  - No 3-star centered at Node 8.

- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 16, 17, 19, 26
  - No 3-star centered at Node 9.

- Node 10 has 3 neighbors: 4, 18, 27
  - No 3-star centered at Node 10.

- Node 11 has 1 neighbor: 4
  - No 3-star centered at Node 11.

- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: 7, 14, 19, 20, 24
  - No 3-star centered at Node 12.

- Node 13 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 14
  - No 3-star centered at Node 13.

- Node 14 has 2 neighbors: 12, 13
  - No 3-star centered at Node 14.

- Node 15 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 25
  - No 3-star centered at Node 15.

- Node 16 has 3 neighbors: 9, 18, 29
  - No 3-star centered at Node 16.

- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 8, 9, 19, 20
  - No 3-star centered at Node 17.

- Node 18 has 4 neighbors: 2, 10, 16, 0
  - No 3-star centered at Node 18.

- Node 19 has 5 neighbors: 12, 17, 24, 26, 27
  - No 3-star centered at Node 19.

- Node 20 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 12, 17
  - No 3-star centered at Node 20.

- Node 22 has 2 neighbors: 7, 29
  - No 3-star centered at Node 22.

- Node 23 has 2 neighbors: 1, 28
  - No 3-star centered at Node 23.

- Node 24 has 3 neighbors: 12, 19, 29
  - No 3-star centered at Node 24.

- Node 25 has 2 neighbors: 15, 6
  - No 3-star centered at Node 25.

- Node 26 has 5 neighbors: 6, 9, 19, 29, 16
  - No 3-star centered at Node 26.

- Node 27 has 2 neighbors: 19, 10
  - No 3-star centered at Node 27.

- Node 28 has 2 neighbors: 6, 23
  - No 3-star centered at Node 28.

- Node 29 has 6 neighbors: 7, 12, 16, 22, 24, 26
  - No 3-star centered at Node 29.

Overall, the unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (3, 13, 15)>, <5, (0, 7, 20)>>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
