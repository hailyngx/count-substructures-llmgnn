Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 14) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 2
- Node 2: degree = 5
- Node 3: degree = 4
- Node 4: degree = 4
- Node 5: degree = 2
- Node 6: degree = 3
- Node 7: degree = 4
- Node 8: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 4
- Node 10: degree = 3
- Node 11: degree = 5
- Node 12: degree = 6
- Node 13: degree = 4
- Node 14: degree = 5

2. Identify the central node:
- Central nodes are nodes with degree 3. In this case, nodes 6 and 10 are central nodes.

3. Find the leaves connected to each central node:
- For central node 6: Leaves = {9, 3, 2}
- For central node 10: Leaves = {12, 2, 11}

4. Count the number of 3-stars:
- For central node 6: There is 1 unique 3-star: <6, (9, 3, 2)>
- For central node 10: There is 1 unique 3-star: <10, (12, 2, 11)>
