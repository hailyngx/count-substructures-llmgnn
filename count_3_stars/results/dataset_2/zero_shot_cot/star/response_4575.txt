Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of potential 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a central node with three connected leaves, we need to look for nodes with exactly 3 neighbors.

Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 5
- Node 9
- Node 6

Now, let's find the leaves for each potential 3-star:

For central node 5:
- Leaves: 9, 8, 4, 0, 3

For central node 9:
- Leaves: 6, 2, 7, 0, 5

For central node 6:
- Leaves: 9, 7, 0

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 

[<5, (9, 8, 4)>, <5, (9, 0, 3)>]
