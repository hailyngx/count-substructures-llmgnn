Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify all possible 3-star configurations:

1. <0, (9, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 2)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 1)>
4. <3, (5, 8, -)>
5. <4, (5, 9, 0)>
6. <5, (1, 4, 2)>
7. <6, (1, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (6, 9, 8)>
9. <8, (5, 4, 7)>
10. <9, (0, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
