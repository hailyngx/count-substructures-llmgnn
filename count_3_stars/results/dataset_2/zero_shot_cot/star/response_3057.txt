Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5:
- Node 2 is connected to node 5
- Node 4 is connected to node 5
- Node 7 is connected to node 5

Now we can form the 3-stars using node 5 as the center:
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
This 3-star has nodes 2, 4, and 7 as leaves.

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 9:
- Node 8 is connected to node 9
- Node 1 is connected to node 9
- Node 7 is connected to node 9

Now we can form the 3-stars using node 9 as the center:
<9, (8, 1, 7)>
This 3-star has nodes 8, 1, and 7 as leaves.

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph, which are <5, (2, 4, 7)> and <9, (8, 1, 7)>.
