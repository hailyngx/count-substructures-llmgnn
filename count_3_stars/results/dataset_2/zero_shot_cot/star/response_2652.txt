Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 14) (6, 15) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 17) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 16) (7, 2) (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 7) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 0) (17, 9) (17, 3) (11, 5) (11, 1) (19, 16) (19, 0) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <4, (12, 14, 2)>, <13, (8, 2, 4)>, <2, (1, 13, 7)>, <7, (15, 16, 2)>, <10, (8, 16, 0)>.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
