Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (8, 9) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 19) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 14) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 2) (3, 18) (3, 14) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph.

<4, (7, 10, 16)>
<7, (0, 14, 15)>
<10, (9, 4, 11)>
<16, (4, 7, 12)>
<0, (7, 17, 6)>
<9, (10, 8, 14)>
<15, (7, 18, 14)>
<19, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (2, 1,  )>
<3, (18, 14,  )>
<12, (16, 13, 17)>
<2, (5, 1,  )>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
