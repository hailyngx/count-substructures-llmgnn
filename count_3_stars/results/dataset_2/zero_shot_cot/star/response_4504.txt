Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 12) (9, 26) (9, 25) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 8) (18, 22) (18, 21) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 25) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 0) (17, 2) (8, 26) (8, 23) (8, 6) (23, 26) (23, 8) (23, 25) (4, 21) (4, 1) (4, 2) (0, 17) (0, 1) (7, 6) (5, 19) (5, 29) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 12) (20, 29) (20, 3) (29, 5) (29, 20) (29, 12) (3, 20) (3, 24) (21, 18) (21, 4) (21, 16) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 24) (14, 2) (16, 21) (28, 17) (28, 12) (25, 13) (25, 9) (25, 11) (25, 23) (25, 2) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 15) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 27) (15, 5) (15, 24) (15, 6) (15, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 27) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 25) (2, 15) (12, 22) (12, 19) (12, 29) (12, 28) (27, 13) (27, 6) (27, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<13, (22, 25, 27)>
<22, (13, 18, 12)>
<9, (26, 25, 23)>
<26, (9, 8, 23)>
<18, (22, 21, 0)>
<10, (11, 17, 25)>
<11, (10, 14, 19)>
<17, (10, 28, 0)>
<8, (26, 23, 6)>
<23, (26, 8, 25)>
<4, (21, 1, 2)>
<0, (17, 1, 27)>
<5, (19, 29, 15)>
<19, (11, 5, 12)>
<20, (29, 3, 5)>
<29, (5, 20, 12)>
<3, (20, 24, 21)>
<21, (18, 4, 16)>
<14, (11, 5, 24)>
<16, (21, 28, 2)>
<28, (17, 12, 16)>
<27, (13, 6, 1)>

Now, we count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[22]
