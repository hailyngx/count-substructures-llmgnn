Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 16) (9, 27) (26, 21) (26, 0) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 21) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 25) (27, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 3) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 5) (21, 14) (4, 0) (4, 17) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 2) (11, 28) (11, 29) (28, 11) (28, 14) (28, 10) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (25, 27) (25, 6) (25, 29) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 18) (23, 5) (23, 6) (19, 15) (19, 10) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 17) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 18) (5, 21) (5, 23) (5, 17) (2, 20) (2, 24) (14, 21) (14, 28) (14, 18) (17, 4) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 5) (12, 20) (12, 3) (12, 24) (12, 18) (6, 25) (6, 23) (6, 13) (18, 16) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 12) (24, 2) (24, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 1) (29, 11) (29, 25) (1, 27) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 28) (10, 19) (10, 22) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 26, 27)>
<1, (0, 27, 13)>
<3, (7, 12, 18)>
<4, (0, 16, 17)>
<5, (21, 17, 23)>
<6, (13, 23, 25)>
<7, (3, 16, 0)>
<9, (16, 27, 25)>
<10, (1, 19, 22)>
<11, (1, 28, 29)>
<12, (3, 18, 20)>
<13, (1, 6, 3)>
<14, (18, 21, 28)>
<15, (19, 20, 21)>
<16, (0, 9, 7)>
<17, (5, 16, 22)>
<18, (3, 12, 14)>
<19, (10, 15, 21)>
<20, (12, 15, 2)>
<21, (15, 26, 21)>
<22, (10, 17, 16)>
<23, (5, 6, 13)>
<24, (2, 12, 24)>
<25, (6, 27, 29)>
<26, (0, 21, 15)>
<27, (1, 25, 9)>
<28, (11, 10, 14)>
<29, (11, 25, 28)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
