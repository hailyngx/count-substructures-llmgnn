Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (27, 28) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 20) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 8) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 25) (26, 27) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 16) (22, 21) (22, 4) (28, 27) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 24) (5, 24) (13, 27) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 6) (18, 19) (18, 13) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 9) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 25) (0, 10) (0, 17) (3, 7) (3, 24) (3, 9) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 2) (17, 21) (17, 0) (17, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 24) (20, 21) (20, 11) (20, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 24) (25, 19) (25, 4) (25, 12) (12, 14) (12, 25) (29, 11) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (8, 9, 10)>
<2, (6, 17, 24)>
<3, (7, 9, 24)>
<4, (13, 18, 25)>
<5, (3, 24, 28)>
<6, (2, 6, 17)>
<7, (3, 6, 24)>
<8, (1, 8, 10)>
<9, (7, 9, 27)>
<10, (1, 10, 11)>
<11, (10, 11, 28)>
<12, (12, 14, 25)>
<13, (4, 13, 18)>
<14, (12, 14, 24)>
<15, (24, 28, 5)>
<16, (4, 16, 26)>
<17, (2, 17, 21)>
<18, (13, 18, 19)>

Count of 3-stars: [18]
