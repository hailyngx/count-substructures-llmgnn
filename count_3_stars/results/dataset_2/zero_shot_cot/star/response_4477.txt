Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 5) (12, 14) (12, 5) (12, 10) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (9, 11, 5)>
<2, (4, 11, 14)>
<3, (13, 8, 4)>
<5, (1, 7, 11)>
<7, (1, 8, 14)>
<9, (1, 11, 10)>
<10, (9, 7, 12)>
<11, (9, 1, 8)>
<12, (14, 5, 10)>
<13, (6, 9, 3)>
<14, (2, 7, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
