Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 8) (13, 23) (22, 5) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 5) (21, 11) (4, 7) (4, 24) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 19) (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 0) (8, 13) (8, 26) (8, 28) (8, 27) (11, 21) (11, 9) (11, 29) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 5) (6, 22) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 28) (6, 12) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 6) (28, 19) (0, 7) (0, 26) (25, 7) (25, 16) (25, 24) (25, 2) (15, 26) (15, 23) (15, 16) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 11) (12, 14) (12, 6) (18, 19) (18, 3) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 18) (19, 16) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 2) (20, 27) (23, 13) (23, 15) (24, 4) (24, 25) (24, 27) (27, 8) (27, 20) (27, 24) (27, 2) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 17) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 19) (2, 25) (2, 3) (2, 27) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step to find all the 3-stars.

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 26, and 29.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 9, 15, and 29.

2. Group the 3-stars:
<21, (1, 5, 11)>
<9, (11, 26, 29)>
<26, (9, 15, 29)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
