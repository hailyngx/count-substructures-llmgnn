Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 12) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 11) (10, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 6) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 4) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 0) (12, 15) (12, 13) (19, 9) (19, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star by having exactly three edges connected to them. 

Here are the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 11: (10, 7, 0)
- Node 16: (15, 13, 4)
- Node 3: (15, 1, 4)
- Node 15: (16, 3, 12)
- Node 9: (5, 0, 19)
- Node 1: (3, 17, 10)
- Node 8: (11, 14, 0)
- Node 13: (16, 17, 12)
- Node 14: (8, 13, 7)
- Node 17: (1, 13, 4)
- Node 18: (2, 4, 6)
- Node 6: (18, 19, 4)
- Node 4: (16, 3, 17)

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

Unique 3-stars: <<11, (10, 7, 0)>, <16, (15, 13, 4)>, <3, (15, 1, 4)>, <15, (16, 3, 12)>, <9, (5, 0, 19)>, <1, (3, 17, 10)>, <8, (11, 14, 0)>, <13, (16, 17, 12)>, <14, (8, 13, 7)>, <17, (1, 13, 4)>, <18, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (18, 19, 4)>, <4, (16, 3, 17)>].
