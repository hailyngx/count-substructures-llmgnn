Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list out the neighbors for each node:
Node 0: 7, 9, 8, 5, 3
Node 1: 4, 7, 9
Node 2: 6, 8
Node 3: 8, 5, 0
Node 4: 7, 8, 9, 1
Node 5: 6, 8, 0, 3
Node 6: 7, 9, 5, 2
Node 7: 4, 0, 6, 9, 1
Node 8: 4, 2, 5, 0, 3
Node 9: 4, 7, 6, 1, 0

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
1. <4, (9, 7, 8)> (center node: 4, leaves: 9, 7, 8)
2. <7, (4, 6, 1)> (center node: 7, leaves: 4, 6, 1)
3. <6, (7, 9, 5)> (center node: 6, leaves: 7, 9, 5)
4. <9, (4, 7, 6)> (center node: 9, leaves: 4, 7, 6)
5. <8, (4, 2, 5)> (center node: 8, leaves: 4, 2, 5)
6. <5, (6, 8, 0)> (center node: 5, leaves: 6, 8, 0)
7. <2, (6, 8, 0)> (center node: 2, leaves: 6, 8, 0)
8. <0, (7, 9, 8)> (center node: 0, leaves: 7, 9, 8)
9. <1, (4, 7, 9)> (center node: 1, leaves: 4, 7, 9)
10. <3, (8, 5, 0)> (center node: 3, leaves: 8, 5, 0)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
