Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. 
Nodes with degree 4 are potential central nodes of 3-stars. Here are the nodes with degree 4: 4, 5, 7, 13, 14.

Next, we examine each potential central node to see if they indeed form a 3-star. 
Let's start with node 4:
Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 14. These connections form a 3-star with node 4 as the center. This gives us the 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 14)>.

Moving to node 5:
Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 12. Although it has 4 connections, they do not form a 3-star structure since nodes 2, 3, and 12 are not directly connected to each other. Hence, node 5 does not form a 3-star.

Next, node 7:
Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 8, and 11. The connections to 4, 11, and 6 form a 3-star with node 7 as the center. This gives us the 3-star: <7, (4, 11, 6)>.

Moving to node 13:
Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 11. However, these connections do not form a 3-star since nodes 3, 7, and 11 are not directly linked to each other. Hence, node 13 does not form a 3-star.

Finally, node 14:
Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 12. The connections to 0, 4, and 12 form a 3-star with node 14 as the center. This gives us the 3-star: <14, (0, 4, 12)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <4, (5, 7, 14)> and <14, (0, 4, 12)>. 
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
