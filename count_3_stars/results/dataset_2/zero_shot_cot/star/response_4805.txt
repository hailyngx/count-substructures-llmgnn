Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 5) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 23) (27, 6) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (28, 16) (28, 1) (29, 10) (29, 5) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 7) (9, 22) (9, 24) (9, 3) (9, 1) (22, 9) (22, 19) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 27) (4, 3) (4, 20) (20, 7) (20, 4) (20, 21) (20, 24) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 14) (26, 21) (6, 27) (6, 24) (6, 2) (24, 9) (24, 20) (24, 6) (24, 8) (19, 22) (19, 0) (25, 8) (18, 16) (18, 13) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 27) (23, 5) (23, 1) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 23) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 0) (21, 20) (21, 26) (13, 14) (13, 18) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we need to look for every node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<11, (3, 14, 1)>
<16, (28, 18, 5)>
<15, (27, 5, 12)>
<27, (15, 4, 23)>
<10, (17, 2, 29)>
<17, (10, 0, 12)>
<12, (15, 17, 7)>
<9, (22, 24, 3)>
<22, (9, 19, 0)>
<3, (11, 9, 4)>
<4, (27, 3, 20)>
<20, (7, 4, 21)>
<14, (11, 26, 13)>
<26, (14, 21, 13)>
<6, (27, 24, 2)>
<24, (9, 20, 6)>
<19, (22, 0, 25)>
<18, (16, 13, 5)>
<5, (16, 15, 29)>
<23, (27, 5, 1)>
<1, (11, 28, 9)>
<2, (11, 10, 6)>
<8, (3, 24, 25)>
<21, (20, 26, 13)>
<13, (14, 18, 21)>
<0, (17, 19, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].
