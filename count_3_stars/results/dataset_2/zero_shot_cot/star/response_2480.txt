Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (16, 11) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 4) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 3) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 18) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 4) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 15) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 14) (10, 9) (19, 0) (19, 12) (12, 13) (12, 19) (12, 15) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Let's go through the list of edges to find any 3-stars present:

- Edge (11, 16) connects nodes 11 and 16.
- Edge (11, 3) connects nodes 11 and 3.
- Edge (11, 1) connects nodes 11 and 1.
- Edge (16, 11) connects nodes 16 and 11.
- Edge (1, 11) connects nodes 1 and 11.
- Edge (1, 17) connects nodes 1 and 17.
- Edge (1, 3) connects nodes 1 and 3.
- Edge (3, 11) connects nodes 3 and 11.
- Edge (3, 18) connects nodes 3 and 18.
- Edge (18, 3) connects nodes 18 and 3.
- Edge (2, 14) connects nodes 2 and 14.
- Edge (2, 4) connects nodes 2 and 4.
- Edge (14, 17) connects nodes 14 and 17.
- Edge (14, 7) connects nodes 14 and 7.
- Edge (17, 1) connects nodes 17 and 1.
- Edge (17, 14) connects nodes 17 and 14.
- Edge (17, 0) connects nodes 17 and 0.
- Edge (2, 18) connects nodes 2 and 18.
- Edge (18, 2) connects nodes 18 and 2.
- Edge (5, 6) connects nodes 5 and 6.
- Edge (5, 13) connects nodes 5 and 13.
- Edge (13, 2) connects nodes 13 and 2.
- Edge (13, 5) connects nodes 13 and 5.
- Edge (0, 17) connects nodes 0 and 17.
- Edge (0, 8) connects nodes 0 and 8.
- Edge (14, 2) connects nodes 14 and 2.
- Edge (6, 4) connects nodes 6 and 4.
- Edge (6, 7) connects nodes 6 and 7.
- Edge (6, 8) connects nodes 6 and 8.
- Edge (4, 2) connects nodes 4 and 2.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There is one 3-star in the given graph, with the central node being node 11 and the leaf nodes being nodes 1, 3, and 16.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [1]

Unique 3-star found in the graph: 
<11, (1, 3, 16)>
