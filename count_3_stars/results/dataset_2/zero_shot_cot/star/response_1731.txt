Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 4, which can act as the center of a 3-star. These nodes are 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Now, let's enumerate the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<6, (4, 7, 3)>
<7, (9, 4, 8)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get [6].
