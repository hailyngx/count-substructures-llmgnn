Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (21, 10) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 11) (18, 22) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 8) (22, 2) (22, 18) (26, 1) (26, 16) (15, 20) (15, 24) (15, 28) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 5) (28, 15) (28, 14) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (9, 7) (9, 4) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 3) (24, 15) (25, 7) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 11) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 0) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 16) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 23) (16, 26) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 8) (5, 20) (5, 16) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 5) (19, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 23) (11, 29) (11, 25) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 8) (23, 25) (23, 3) (23, 0) (8, 18) (8, 7) (8, 27) (8, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.
   - Node 7 has 5 edges (6, 8, 9, 12, 25) connected to it.
   - Node 12 has 4 edges (3, 4, 7, 9) connected to it.
   - Node 13 has 3 edges (0, 17, 25) connected to it.
   - Node 14 has 2 edges (5, 28) connected to it.
   - Node 15 has 3 edges (20, 24, 28) connected to it.
   - Node 16 has 4 edges (4, 5, 10, 26) connected to it.
   - Node 20 has 3 edges (5, 15, 27) connected to it.
   - Node 22 has 2 edges (2, 18) connected to it.
   - Node 23 has 3 edges (0, 11, 25) connected to it.
   - Node 27 has 3 edges (8, 18, 20) connected to it.
   - Node 29 has 2 edges (2, 11) connected to it.

2. Identify 3-stars by considering each potential center node and its three connected nodes:
   - From the identified nodes above, the only potential central nodes with 3 connected edges are 13, 14, 15, 20, 23, and 27.

3. List the unique 3-stars:
   - <13, (0, 17, 25)>
   - <14, (5, 28, 14)>
   - <15, (20, 24, 28)>
   - <20, (5, 15, 27)>
   - <23, (0, 11, 25)>
   - <27, (8, 18, 20)>
