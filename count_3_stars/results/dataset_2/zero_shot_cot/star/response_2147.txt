Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 19) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 18) (18, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 11) (19, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 4) (14, 8) (8, 14) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should focus on nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges. These nodes can potentially act as the centers of 3-stars.

Looking at the list of edges, we can identify the nodes that have degree 3:
- Node 0
- Node 6
- Node 12
- Node 17
- Node 18

Let's count the 3-stars for each of these potential central nodes:

For node 0:
- <0, (13, 7, 10)>
- <0, (7, 10, 12)>
[2]

For node 6:
- <6, (1, 15, 17)>
- <6, (1, 15, 18)>
- <6, (1, 17, 18)>
- <6, (1, 6, 16)>
[4]

For node 12:
- <12, (2, 16, 5)>
[1]

For node 17:
- <17, (6, 11, 7)>
- <17, (6, 11, 19)>
[2]

For node 18:
- <18, (1, 3, 9)>
[1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2+4+1+2+1] = [10].
