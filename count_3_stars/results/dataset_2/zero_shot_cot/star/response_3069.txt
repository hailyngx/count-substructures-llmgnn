Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 2) 

Response:
We can follow these steps to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Identify nodes with three neighbors, which would form a 3-star.
2. Count the number of possible 3-stars.

Let's start with the steps:
1. Nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 0: (1, 3, 7, 12)
- Node 2: (1, 3, 7, 10, 12, 14)
- Node 4: (1, 7, 12, 14)
- Node 6: (5, 8, 12, 14)
- Node 8: (5, 6, 7, 14)

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
- For each node with three neighbors, find how many 3-stars can be formed.
- Calculate the total count.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(4*4) + (6*6) + (4*4) + (4*4) + (4*4)] = [16 + 36 + 16 + 16 + 16] = [100].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
<0, (1, 3, 7, 12)>
<2, (1, 3, 7, 10, 12, 14)>
<4, (1, 7, 12, 14)>
<6, (5, 8, 12, 14)>
<8, (5, 6, 7, 14)>
