Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 16) (22, 21) (22, 8) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 8) (6, 24) (6, 26) (6, 20) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 4) (8, 22) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 1) (27, 24) (27, 11) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 7) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 26) (1, 4) (26, 6) (26, 1) (26, 10) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 25) (19, 29) (19, 21) (19, 24) (19, 23) (11, 27) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 7) (17, 2) (17, 25) (17, 16) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (23, 19) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 16) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 28) (7, 16) (16, 13) (16, 17) (16, 20) (16, 23) (16, 7) (25, 5) (25, 4) (25, 17) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 21) (10, 26) (10, 20) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 23) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 28) (29, 19) (29, 21) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 24) (21, 29) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can consider each node as a candidate central node and check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (15, 8, 26)>
<2, (7, 14, 17)>
<3, (9, 15, 14)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<5, (13, 4, 25)>
<6, (24, 20, 26)>
<7, (16, 2, 28)>
<8, (15, 8, 4)>
<9, (3, 0, 9)>
<10, (20, 6, 10)>
<11, (27, 28, 0)>
<13, (16, 5, 17)>
<14, (2, 3, 23)>
<15, (1, 3, 7)>
<16, (13, 17, 23)>
<19, (21, 24, 29)>
<20, (6, 10, 16)>
<21, (22, 19, 29)>
<22, (8, 21, 19)>
<23, (14, 16, 23)>
<24, (6, 21, 19)>
<25, (5, 4, 17)>
<26, (6, 1, 10)>
<27, (24, 11, 28)>
<28, (11, 7, 0)>
<29, (21, 19, 29)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph, which is 27.

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
