Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 4 since it is the center of potential 3-stars. 
The nodes directly connected to node 4 are 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Let's now check if any of the connected nodes have exactly 3 neighbors. 
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 4, 0, 3, 5, and 1.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 4, 7, 3, and 8.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 4, 1, 8, and 2.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 1, 9, and 2.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 4 and 3.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph. 
The number of 3-stars is: [0]
