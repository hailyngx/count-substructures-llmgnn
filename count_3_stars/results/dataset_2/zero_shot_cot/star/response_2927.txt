Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 18) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 19) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 5) (18, 9) (18, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors to find the potential central nodes of the 3-stars:
- Node 11 has neighbors 3, 12, and 15.
- Node 16 has neighbors 0, 14, and 17.
- Node 3 has neighbors 11, 0, and 9.
- Node 15 has neighbors 11, 8, and 12.
- Node 14 has neighbors 16, 17, and no more nodes.
- Node 17 has neighbors 14, 10, and no more nodes.
- Node 6 has neighbors 8, 4, and no more nodes.
- Node 9 has neighbors 3, 18, and 4.
- Node 10 has neighbors 17, 12, and 7.
- Node 2 has neighbors 8, 1, and no more nodes.
- Node 8 has neighbors 15, 6, and 2.
- Node 5 has neighbors 13, 12, and 7.
- Node 13 has neighbors 9, 5, and no more nodes.
- Node 0 has neighbors 16, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 has neighbors 10, 5, and 0.
- Node 1 has neighbors 2, 8, and 19.
- Node 12 has neighbors 11, 15, 10, and 5.
- Node 18 has neighbors 9, 0, and no more nodes.
- Node 4 has neighbors 3, 6, 9, and 10.
- Node 19 has neighbors 7, 1, and no more nodes.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- There are 4 possible 3-stars centered at node 12: <12, (11, 15, 10)>, <12, (11, 15, 5)>, <12, (10, 15, 5)>, <12, (11, 10, 5)>.
- There is 1 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (15, 6, 2)>.
- There is 1 3-star centered at node 10: <10, (17, 12, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
