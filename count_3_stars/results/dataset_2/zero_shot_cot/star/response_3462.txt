Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 20) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 14) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 13) (1, 18) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 10) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 19) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 26) (28, 4) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 14) (17, 2) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 29) (25, 11) (25, 4) (25, 13) (27, 11) (27, 22) (27, 7) (7, 23) (7, 27) (7, 26) (14, 15) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 5) (26, 4) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 6) (10, 8) (10, 26) (19, 23) (19, 6) (22, 27) (22, 0) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 23) (6, 26) (6, 19) (6, 18) (20, 16) (20, 1) (18, 1) (18, 23) (18, 6) (18, 24) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 24) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 12) (0, 22) (0, 21) (21, 0) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.
    - Nodes 1, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 20, 22, 23, and 29 are connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For each of these nodes, identify the nodes they are connected to and check if they form a 3-star configuration.
    - For node 1: (1, 3, 13), (1, 3, 20)
    - For node 4: (4, 9, 29), (4, 9, 15), (4, 9, 25), (4, 14, 26)
    - For node 9: (9, 4, 15), (9, 4, 29), (9, 14, 26)
    - For node 12: (12, 5, 24)
    - For node 14: (14, 9, 26), (14, 9, 29)
    - For node 18: (18, 1, 23), (18, 6, 23), (18, 24, 8)
    - For node 20: (20, 1, 16)
    - For node 22: (22, 0, 27)
    - For node 23: (23, 6, 19)
    - For node 29: (29, 4, 14)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found. 
   - Total = 12

Therefore, [12].  

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 13, 20)>
<4, (9, 29, 15)>
<4, (9, 14, 26)>
<9, (4, 15, 29)>
<9, (4, 14, 26)>
<12, (5, 24)>
<14, (9, 26, 29)>
<18, (1, 23, 6)>
<18, (6, 23, 24)>
<18, (24, 8, 18)>
<20, (1, 16)>
<22, (0, 27)>
<23, (6, 19)>
<29, (4, 14)>
