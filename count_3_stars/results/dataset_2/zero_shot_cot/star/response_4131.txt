Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
