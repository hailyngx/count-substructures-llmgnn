Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 7, 9)>

There are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
