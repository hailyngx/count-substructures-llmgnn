Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 3) (13, 15) (22, 0) (22, 24) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 25) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 2) (27, 4) (27, 25) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (18, 26) (18, 12) (18, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 20) (6, 28) (6, 10) (28, 6) (17, 29) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 25) (29, 24) (9, 19) (9, 16) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (4, 27) (4, 25) (26, 18) (26, 17) (26, 29) (26, 3) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 14) (25, 21) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 11) (3, 13) (3, 26) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 25) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 23) (8, 1) (8, 18) (8, 7) (8, 20) (8, 24) (24, 22) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 14) (14, 10) (14, 24) (14, 5) (5, 20) (5, 16) (5, 14) (23, 21) (23, 10) (23, 19) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

Step 1: Identify the nodes that are connected to three other nodes.

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 15, and 21.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 11, and 19.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 25, 27, and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 14, 16, and 20.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 11, and 12.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 18, and 20.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, 23, and 6.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 16, and 18.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 2, 16, and 23.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 1, 23, and 25.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 10, 19, and 21.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 14, 22, and 29.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 11, 21, and 29.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 17, 18, and 29.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 17, 24, and 25.

Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.

Count: 16

[16]
