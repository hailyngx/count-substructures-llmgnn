Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (3, 10) (4, 9) (4, 19) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 17) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 12) (15, 2) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 13) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (17, 2) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 6) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 19) (7, 6) (7, 14) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 18) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 18) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify all nodes with degree 3 since a 3-star has one central node and three leaves.
- Node 2, 9, 10, 15, 0, 11, 12, 13 have a degree of 4.
- Node 4, 5, 7, 16, 19 have a degree of 3.
- Nodes 1, 3, 6, 8, 14, 17, 18 have a degree of 2.

Step 2: Check if nodes with degree 3 are connected to each other.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 19.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 11, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 19, 6, 14.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 14.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 14, 6.

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars found.
- <4, (9, 19)>
- <5, (2, 11, 7)>
- <7, (5, 19, 6)>
- <16, (1, 14)>
- <19, (4, 7, 14)>

Step 4: Count the number of unique 3-stars found.
- Count = 5
