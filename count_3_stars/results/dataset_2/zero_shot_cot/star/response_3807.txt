Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 2) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 13) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 9) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 2) (8, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 11) (2, 15) (2, 16) (2, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (15, 14, 13)>
- <2, (15, 17, 16)>
- <3, (9, 13, 6)>
- <4, (18, 11, 12)>
- <5, (13, 8, 12)>
- <6, (18, 11, 13)>
- <7, (18, 0, 9)>
- <9, (14, 7, 1)>
- <12, (5, 13, 10)>
- <13, (5, 6, 1)>
- <14, (0, 15, 9)>
- <15, (10, 1, 2)>
- <16, (10, 17, 2)>
- <17, (16, 11, 2)>
- <18, (6, 4, 7)>

There are 14 unique 3-star graphs found in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
