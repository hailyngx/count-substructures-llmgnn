Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find all the 3-stars. 

By definition, each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes called leaves. 

Now let's go through each node and its neighbors to identify the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 14, 7, 21, so <0, (14, 7, 21)> is a 3-star.
- Node 1 has neighbors: 11, 24, 13, so <1, (11, 24, 13)> is a 3-star.
- Node 2 has neighbors: 26, 7, so <2, (26, 7, -)> is a potential 3-star.
- Node 3 has neighbors: 14, 21, so <3, (14, 21, -)> is a potential 3-star.
- Node 4 has neighbors: 8, so no 3-star here.
- Node 5 has neighbors: 12, 23, so <5, (12, 23, -)> is a potential 3-star.
- Node 6 has neighbors: 10, 28, 18, so <6, (10, 28, 18)> is a 3-star.
- Node 7 has neighbors: 21, 0, 22, so <7, (21, 0, 22)> is a 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 11, 24, so <8, (4, 11, 24)> is a 3-star.
- Node 9 has neighbors: 10, so no 3-star here.
- Node 10 has neighbors: 9, 11, 6, so <10, (9, 11, 6)> is a 3-star.
- Node 11 has neighbors: 10, 1, 8, so <11, (10, 1, 8)> is a 3-star.
- Node 12 has neighbors: 27, 5, 29, so <12, (27, 5, 29)> is a 3-star.
- Node 13 has neighbors: 7, 1, 15, so <13, (7, 1, 15)> is a 3-star.
- Node 14 has neighbors: 17, 0, 3, 15, so <14, (17, 0, 3)> is a 3-star.
- Node 15 has neighbors: 14, 23, 13, so <15, (14, 23, 13)> is a 3-star.
- Node 16 has neighbors: 28, 23, 19, so <16, (28, 23, 19)> is a 3-star.
- Node 17 has neighbors: 14, 22, so <17, (14, 22, -)> is a potential 3-star.
- Node 18 has neighbors: 6, 21, so <18, (6, 21, -)> is a potential 3-star.
- Node 19 has neighbors: 11, 12, 6, 16, so <19, (11, 12, 6)> is a 3-star.
- Node 20 has neighbors: 26, 21, so <20, (26, 21, -)> is a potential 3-star.
- Node 21 has neighbors: 7, 0, 20, 18, so <21, (7, 0, 20)> is a 3-star.
- Node 22 has neighbors: 17, 7, 12, so <22, (17, 7, 12)> is a 3-star.
- Node 23 has neighbors: 26, 5, 15, 16, so <23, (26, 5, 15)> is a 3-star.
- Node 24 has neighbors: 8, 28, 1, so <24, (8, 28, 1)> is a 3-star.
- Node 25 has neighbors: 10, 27, so no 3-star here.
- Node 26 has neighbors: 23, 2, 20, so <26, (23, 2, 20)> is a 3-star.
- Node 27 has neighbors: 12, 25, so no 3-star here.
- Node 28 has neighbors: 6, 29, 16, 24, so <28, (6, 29, 16)> is a 3-star.
- Node 29 has neighbors: 12, 28, so <29, (12, 28, -)> is a potential 3-star.

Now let's count the unique 3-stars found: 

<0, (14, 7, 21)>, <1, (11, 24, 13)>, <6, (10, 28, 18)>, <7, (21, 0, 22)>, <8, (4, 11, 24)>, <10, (9, 11, 6)>, <11, (10, 1, 8)>, <12, (27, 5, 29)>, <13, (7, 1, 15)>, <14, (17, 0, 3)>, <15, (14, 23, 13)>, <16, (28, 23, 19)>, <19, (11, 12, 6)>, <21, (7, 0, 20)>, <22, (17, 7, 12)>, <23, (26, 5, 15)>, <24, (8, 28, 1)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
