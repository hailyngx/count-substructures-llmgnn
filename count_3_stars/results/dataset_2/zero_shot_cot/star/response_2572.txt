Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 21) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 1) (20, 26) (20, 18) (25, 29) (25, 22) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 27) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 1) (29, 25) (29, 21) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 26) (18, 17) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 1) (18, 3) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 1) (7, 24) (7, 26) (7, 13) (12, 0) (12, 19) (0, 12) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 23) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 22) (15, 11) (15, 24) (8, 6) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 22) (19, 12) (19, 2) (27, 17) (27, 10) (26, 20) (26, 4) (26, 5) (26, 7) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 18) (3, 24) (21, 17) (21, 29) (21, 16) (23, 5) (23, 16) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 11) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 18) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (22, 25) (22, 15) (22, 8) (11, 9) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes that are connected directly to node 17:
- Node 10, Node 27, and Node 18 are directly connected to Node 17, forming the 3-stars: <17, (10, 27, 18)>.

Next, we identify the nodes that are connected directly to node 6:
- Node 2, Node 8, and Node 16 are directly connected to Node 6, forming the 3-stars: <6, (2, 8, 16)>.

Following the same process for the remaining nodes directly connected to the centers, we find:
- Node 9, Node 11, and Node 1 are directly connected to Node 9, forming the 3-stars: <9, (11, 1, 9)>.
- Node 20, Node 26, and Node 18 are directly connected to Node 20, forming the 3-stars: <20, (26, 18, 4)> (Note: This was listed incorrectly in the initial response).
- Node 25, Node 29, and Node 21 are directly connected to Node 25, forming the 3-stars: <25, (29, 21, 22)>.
- Node 4, Node 13, and Node 26 are directly connected to Node 4, forming the 3-stars: <4, (18, 13, 26)>.
- Node 5, Node 23, and Node 1 are directly connected to Node 5, forming the 3-stars: <5, (26, 1, 23)>.
- Node 7, Node 24, and Node 13 are directly connected to Node 7, forming the 3-stars: <7, (26, 13, 24)>.
- Node 12, Node 19, and Node 0 are directly connected to Node 12, forming the 3-stars: <12, (19, 0, 12)>.
- Node 16, Node 21, and Node 23 are directly connected to Node 16, forming the 3-stars: <16, (21, 23, 6)>.
- Node 15, Node 22, and Node 11 are directly connected to Node 15, forming the 3-stars: <15, (11, 22, 15)>.
- Node 8, Node 28, and Node 22 are directly connected to Node 8, forming the 3-stars: <8, (28, 22, 15)>.

Therefore, there are 11 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
The final answer is: [11].
