Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node that is directly connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star pattern around it. We can see the following 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (6, 1, 4)>
<9, (6, 3, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 1)>
<7, (9, 6, 2)>
<4, (5, 2, 0)>
<8, (1, 2, 0)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<0, (9, 1, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
