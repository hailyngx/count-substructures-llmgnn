Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (9, 6, 2)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 7)>
3. <6, (5, 9, 3)>
4. <1, (3, 8, 7)>
5. <3, (6, 1, 4)>
6. <4, (3, 8, 0)>
7. <8, (1, 4, 0)>
8. <0, (4, 8, 7)>
9. <7, (1, 8, 0)>
10. <2, (5, 6, 0)>

As we have identified 10 unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
