Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 4, as these will be the leaves of the 3-stars centered at node 4. From the given edges, nodes 0, 1, 3, and 5 are directly connected to node 4.

Now, let's look for 3-stars centered at node 4. 
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (1, 3, 1)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 7, as these will be the leaves of the 3-stars centered at node 7. From the given edges, nodes 4, 6, and 8 are directly connected to node 7.

Now, let's look for 3-stars centered at node 7. 
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we have found 3 so far. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
