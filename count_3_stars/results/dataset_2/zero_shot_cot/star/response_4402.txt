Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 3) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 14)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<0, (14, 12, 8)>
<14, (9, 0, 12)>
<1, (6, 0, 10)>
<10, (1, 3, 2)>
<3, (10, 4, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 11)>
<11, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 10, 7)>
<8, (5, 0, 3)>
<12, (0, 14, 1)>
<4, (5, 3, 11)>
<13, (6, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 
[14]
