Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 3. This forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 5, 3)>
Node 9 is also connected to nodes 6, 8, and 3. This forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 8, 3)>
Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 4. This forms a 3-star: <8, (6, 9, 4)>
Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 4. This forms a 3-star: <5, (6, 3, 4)>
Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 5, and 2. This forms a 3-star: <4, (8, 5, 2)>
Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7. This forms a 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 7)>
Node 0, 1, and 7 do not form any 3-stars as they do not have exactly three connections to other nodes.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
