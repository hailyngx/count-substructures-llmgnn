Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, we want to identify the 3-stars in the graph. Remember that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (2, 4, 11)>
<9, (8, 10, 12)>
<6, (8, 12, 14)>
<1, (2, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 4, 11)>
<10, (1, 7, 9)>
<11, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 10, 12)>
<12, (6, 9, 7)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<13, (3, 9, 12)>
<4, (3, 5, 10)>
<14, (5, 6, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 14 unique 3-stars listed above. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
