Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 2) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 16) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 16) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 14) (6, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (9, 0) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 14) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 11) (13, 4) (13, 16) 

Response:
I will identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <3, (15, 12, 8)>
2. <15, (3, 1, 2)>
3. <4, (7, 19, 13)>
4. <7, (4, 0, 19)>
5. <10, (17, 5, 16)>
6. <17, (10, 1, 16)>
7. <2, (15, 18, 5)>
8. <18, (2, 16, 13)>
9. <5, (10, 2, 12)>
10. <6, (14, 0, 1)>
11. <16, (15, 4, 17)>
12. <19, (4, 7, 14)>
13. <12, (3, 5, 11)>
14. <13, (4, 16, 18)>
15. <0, (7, 6, 9)>
16. <9, (0, 11, 5)>
17. <11, (5, 0, 12)>
18. <14, (6, 1, 19)>

Counting each unique 3-star, we find that there are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
