Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 26) (11, 4) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 22) (2, 24) (29, 17) (29, 7) (0, 15) (27, 12) (27, 10) (27, 23) (22, 16) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 8) (23, 27) (23, 22) (23, 18) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 15) (1, 26) (1, 7) (1, 19) (26, 11) (26, 1) (26, 20) (17, 29) (17, 15) (28, 14) (28, 5) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 13) (25, 7) (25, 19) (3, 20) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (21, 16) (21, 13) (4, 11) (4, 22) (4, 3) (10, 27) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 22) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 17) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 9) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 13) (13, 7) (13, 21) (13, 6) (13, 24) (13, 18) (18, 23) (18, 13) (20, 11) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 5) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 20) (9, 14) (5, 12) (5, 28) (5, 3) (5, 20) (5, 14) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

- Node 11: (16, 26, 4)
- Node 16: (11, 21, 24)
- Node 22: (16, 23, 4)
- Node 23: (27, 22, 18)
- Node 12: (27, 5, 15)
- Node 26: (11, 1, 20)
- Node 17: (29, 15)
- Node 28: (14, 5)
- Node 7: (29, 1, 25, 14, 13)
- Node 3: (20, 6, 5, 4)
- Node 4: (11, 22, 3)
- Node 10: (27, 9)
- Node 6: (3, 13)
- Node 8: (22)
- Node 0: (15)
- Node 27: (12, 10, 23)
- Node 1: (26, 7, 19)
- Node 29: (17, 7)
- Node 25: (7, 19)
- Node 21: (16, 13)
- Node 5: (12, 28, 3, 20, 14)
- Node 15: (0, 12, 17)
- Node 19: (1, 25, 9)

Next, we count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are [12] 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
