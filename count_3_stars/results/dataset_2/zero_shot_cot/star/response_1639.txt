Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 6) (0, 15) (0, 22) (0, 23) (27, 10) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 5) (21, 29) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 17) (23, 0) (23, 22) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 18) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 25) (29, 21) (29, 26) (6, 15) (6, 28) (6, 11) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 19) (13, 12) (13, 19) (26, 7) (26, 29) (17, 22) (17, 12) (17, 2) (20, 3) (20, 8) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 25) (19, 24) (19, 16) (10, 27) (10, 21) (10, 9) (10, 25) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 4) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 18) (18, 8) (18, 9) (24, 22) (24, 19) (24, 14) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (25, 28) (25, 19) (25, 10) (25, 1) (25, 4) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 11) (14, 24) (14, 1) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves based on the given edges:

1. Central Node 3: Leaves 15, 20, 2
2. Central Node 15: Leaves 3, 7, 0, 6
3. Central Node 0: Leaves 15, 22, 23
4. Central Node 22: Leaves 0, 23, 2, 24, 17
5. Central Node 7: Leaves 15, 21, 26
6. Central Node 21: Leaves 7, 10, 5, 29
7. Central Node 23: Leaves 0, 22
8. Central Node 5: Leaves 21, 8, 19
9. Central Node 28: Leaves 6, 9, 25
10. Central Node 29: Leaves 21, 26
11. Central Node 6: Leaves 15, 28, 11
12. Central Node 19: Leaves 5, 13, 25, 24, 16
13. Central Node 26: Leaves 7, 29
14. Central Node 17: Leaves 22, 12, 2
15. Central Node 8: Leaves 5, 20, 18
16. Central Node 16: Leaves 19
17. Central Node 10: Leaves 27, 21, 9, 25
18. Central Node 2: Leaves 3, 22, 17, 11, 4
19. Central Node 9: Leaves 28, 10, 18
20. Central Node 18: Leaves 8, 9
21. Central Node 24: Leaves 22, 19, 14
22. Central Node 1: Leaves 25, 14, 4
23. Central Node 11: Leaves 6, 2, 12
24. Central Node 25: Leaves 28, 19, 10, 1, 4
25. Central Node 12: Leaves 13, 17, 11
26. Central Node 14: Leaves 24, 1

Next, let's find all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (15, 20, 2)>
<15, (3, 7, 0)>
<0, (15, 22, 23)>
<22, (0, 23, 2)>
<7, (15, 21, 26)>
<21, (7, 10, 5)>
<23, (0, 22, 0)>
<5, (21, 8, 19)>
<28, (6, 9, 25)>
<29, (21, 26, 21)>
<6, (15, 28, 11)>
<19, (5, 13, 25)>
<26, (7, 29, 7)>
<17, (22, 12, 2)>
<8, (5, 20, 18)>
<16, (19)>
<10, (27, 21, 9)>
<2, (3, 22, 17)>
<9, (28, 10, 18)>
<18, (8, 9)>
<24, (22, 19, 14)>
<1, (25, 14, 4)>
<12, (13, 17, 11)>
<25, (28, 19, 10)>
<14, (24, 1, 4)>

There are a total of [25] 3-stars in the given graph.
