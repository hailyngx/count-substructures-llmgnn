Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (12, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (15, 0) (15, 1) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 4) (19, 16) (19, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 17) (4, 10) (5, 16) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Next, let's find the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. Look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Identify the unique 3-stars in the graph.

After examining the edges, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<4, (0, 10, 17)>
<5, (16, 17, 18)>
<6, (3, 7, 17)>
<10, (2, 7, 13)>
<13, (8, 10, 14)>
<14, (3, 9, 13)>
<17, (1, 4, 5)>
<18, (1, 2, 5)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars found: [8]
