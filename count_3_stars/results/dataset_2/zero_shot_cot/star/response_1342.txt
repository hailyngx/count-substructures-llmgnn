Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 17) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 16) (13, 7) (13, 4) (1, 14) (1, 19) (15, 12) (15, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 6) (0, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 11) (6, 19) (6, 11) (6, 17) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (3, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's list down the possible 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (12, 15, 10)>
<1, (14, 19, 18)>
<2, (8, 5, 17)>
<3, (8, 9, 19)>
<4, (5, 13, 4)>
<5, (2, 8, 17)>
<6, (19, 11, 17)>
<7, (9, 13, 8)>
<8, (7, 2, 3)>
<9, (7, 3, 13)>
<10, (0, 15, 3)>
<11, (12, 14, 6)>
<12, (0, 11, 15)>
<13, (7, 4, 5)>
<14, (1, 18, 11)>
<15, (0, 12, 15)>
<16, (5, 17, 16)>
<17, (2, 5, 6)>
<18, (19, 14, 3)>
<19, (1, 6, 18)>

There are a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
