Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 14) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

While going through the list of edges provided, we can identify the nodes with exactly three incident edges: nodes 5, 9, 6, 8, and 13. These will be the potential central nodes of the 3-stars. Let's find all the unique 3-stars.

<5, (0, 7, 10)>
<9, (2, 6, 11)>
<6, (3, 13, 14)>
<8, (1, 3, 11)>
<13, (6, 8, 14)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find there are [5] 3-stars in the graph.
