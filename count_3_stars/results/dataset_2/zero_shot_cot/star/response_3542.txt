Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 14) (22, 11) (22, 7) (22, 12) (22, 1) (4, 8) (4, 23) (7, 22) (7, 29) (7, 19) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 24) (2, 11) (29, 7) (29, 27) (10, 19) (10, 23) (17, 1) (17, 16) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 25) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 26) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 5) (1, 22) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 28) (6, 21) (6, 15) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 6) (21, 11) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 23) (28, 13) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 16) (26, 2) (26, 8) (26, 14) (11, 22) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 21) (11, 27) (3, 20) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (15, 6) (15, 25) (23, 4) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 27) (9, 24) (9, 19) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 9) (5, 14) (12, 22) (12, 24) (24, 2) (24, 27) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 25) (20, 8) (20, 3) (25, 18) (25, 15) (25, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 21, 28, and 14.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 23, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 22, 29, and 19.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 26, and 11.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 7, 27, and 7.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 19, 23, and 19.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 16, and 1.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 27, and 25.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 20, and 26.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 28, 21, and 1.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 13, 26, and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 22, 17, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 21, 15, and 21.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 17, 28, and 23.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 22, 2, and 14.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 29, 18, and 11.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 4, 27, and 16.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 2, 27, and 9.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 9.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 22, 24, and 24.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 18, 15, and 24.

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
1. <13, (21, 28, 14)>
2. <22, (11, 7, 12)>
3. <4, (8, 23, 8)>
4. <7, (22, 29, 19)>
5. <2, (18, 26, 11)>
6. <29, (7, 27, 7)>
7. <10, (19, 23, 19)>
8. <17, (1, 16, 1)>
9. <18, (2, 27, 25)>
10. <8, (4, 20, 26)>
11. <0, (21, 1, 28)>
12. <14, (13, 26, 11)>
13. <1, (22, 17, 0)>
14. <6, (21, 15, 21)>
15. <16, (17, 28, 23)>
16. <26, (2, 8, 14)>
17. <11, (22, 2, 14)>
18. <27, (29, 18, 11)>
19. <23, (4, 27, 16)>
20. <24, (2, 27, 9)>
21. <19, (7, 10, 9)>
22. <12, (22, 24, 24)>
23. <25, (18, 15, 24)>

[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 23]
