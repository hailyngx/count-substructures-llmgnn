Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 21) (3, 6) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 24) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 16) (2, 17) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 24) (29, 10) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (20, 26) (23, 4) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 28) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 26) (9, 21) (26, 20) (26, 9) (26, 27) (0, 4) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 5) (27, 26) (27, 0) (27, 25) (14, 0) (14, 6) (19, 28) (19, 10) (19, 16) (1, 23) (1, 25) (1, 5) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 12) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 21) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 16) (21, 11) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 10) (24, 7) (24, 29) (24, 18) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 11) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 11) (12, 25) (12, 28) (10, 29) (10, 19) (10, 5) (18, 24) (18, 28) (11, 8) (11, 21) (11, 17) (11, 6) (28, 23) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find them step-by-step:

1. Node 22 is connected to nodes 13, 9, and 21. It forms a 3-star with center 22 and leaves 13, 9, 21. <22, (13, 9, 21)>

2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 23, and 0. It forms a 3-star with center 4 and leaves 7, 23, 0. <4, (7, 23, 0)>

3. Node 29 is connected to nodes 13, 2, and 24. It forms a 3-star with center 29 and leaves 13, 2, 24. <29, (13, 2, 24)>

4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 22, 8, and 26. It forms a 3-star with center 9 and leaves 22, 8, 26. <9, (22, 8, 26)>

5. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 27, and 5. It forms a 3-star with center 0 and leaves 4, 27, 5. <0, (4, 27, 5)>

6. Node 27 is connected to nodes 26, 0, and 25. It forms a 3-star with center 27 and leaves 26, 0, 25. <27, (26, 0, 25)>

7. Node 23 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 1. It forms a 3-star with center 23 and leaves 4, 2, 1. <23, (4, 2, 1)>

8. Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 19. It forms a 3-star with center 16 and leaves 2, 8, 19. <16, (2, 8, 19)>

9. Node 21 is connected to nodes 22, 9, and 16. It forms a 3-star with center 21 and leaves 22, 9, 16. <21, (22, 9, 16)>

10. Node 25 is connected to nodes 7, 27, and 1. It forms a 3-star with center 25 and leaves 7, 27, 1. <25, (7, 27, 1)>

11. Node 28 is connected to nodes 23, 19, and 12. It forms a 3-star with center 28 and leaves 23, 19, 12. <28, (23, 19, 12)>

12. Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 21, and 17. It forms a 3-star with center 11 and leaves 8, 21, 17. <11, (8, 21, 17)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
