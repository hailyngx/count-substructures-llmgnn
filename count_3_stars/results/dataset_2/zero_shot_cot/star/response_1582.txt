Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star and its leaves. A 3-star graph has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs:

- Node 7: (7, 4, 3), (7, 9, 2), (7, 8, 6)
- Node 8: (8, 7, 6), (8, 9, 5), (8, 0, 5)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 6), (1, 9, 2), (1, 5, 6)
- Node 3: (3, 4, 0), (3, 7, 0), (3, 6, 2)

Counting the unique 3-stars:

<7, (4, 3, 9)>, <7, (8, 6, 4)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
