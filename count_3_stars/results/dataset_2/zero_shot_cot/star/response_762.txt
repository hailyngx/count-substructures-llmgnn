Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 7, and 8. <4, (1, 7, 8)>
2. Node 7 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 4, and 6. <7, (1, 4, 6)>
3. Node 1 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 7, and 3. <1, (4, 7, 3)>
4. Node 3 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 1, 9, and 0. <3, (1, 9, 0)>
5. Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7, 9, and 5. <6, (7, 9, 5)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7, 3, and 6. <9, (7, 3, 6)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 4, 6, and 2. <8, (4, 6, 2)>
8. Node 5 forms a 3-star with its neighbors 7, 3, and 6. <5, (7, 3, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
