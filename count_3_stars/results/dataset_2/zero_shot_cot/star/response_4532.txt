Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 8) (16, 21) (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 9) (15, 29) (6, 9) (6, 22) (6, 8) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 29) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 1) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 24) (14, 20) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 19) (17, 2) (27, 4) (27, 28) (27, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 23) (8, 25) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 1) (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 26) (1, 2) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 12) (20, 7) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 13) (28, 21) (28, 27) (28, 18) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 29) (2, 17) (2, 23) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 25) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 24) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 22) (29, 25) (5, 27) (19, 17) (19, 24) (12, 21) (12, 26) (12, 4) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 24) (25, 8) (25, 4) (25, 29) (24, 21) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's start by examining each node's connections to find 3-star patterns:
- Node 1: (1, 7), (1, 23), (1, 26), (1, 2) -> <1, (7, 23, 26)>
- Node 2: (2, 17), (2, 23), (2, 1), (2, 4) -> <2, (17, 23, 1)>
- Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 17) -> <3, (15, 17, 23)>
- Node 4: (4, 27), (4, 2), (4, 12), (4, 25) -> <4, (27, 2, 12)>
- Node 5: (5, 27) -> No 3-star
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 22), (6, 8) -> <6, (9, 22, 8)>
- Node 7: (7, 21), (7, 20), (7, 1) -> <7, (21, 20, 1)>
- Node 8: (8, 11), (8, 6), (8, 23), (8, 25) -> <8, (11, 6, 23)>
- Node 9: (9, 15), (9, 6), (9, 29) -> <9, (15, 6, 29)>
- Node 12: (12, 21), (12, 26), (12, 4) -> <12, (21, 26, 4)>
- Node 13: (13, 26), (13, 20), (13, 24) -> <13, (26, 20, 24)>
- Node 14: (14, 20) -> No 3-star
- Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 23), (15, 9), (15, 29) -> <15, (3, 23, 9)>
- Node 16: (16, 21) -> No 3-star
- Node 17: (17, 3), (17, 20), (17, 19), (17, 2) -> <17, (3, 20, 19)>
- Node 18: (18, 26), (18, 28), (18, 24) -> <18, (26, 28, 24)>
- Node 19: (19, 17), (19, 24) -> No 3-star
- Node 20: (20, 7), (20, 14), (20, 17), (20, 13) -> <20, (7, 14, 17)>
- Node 21: (21, 16), (21, 7), (21, 28), (21, 12), (21, 24) -> <21, (16, 7, 28)>
- Node 22: (22, 11), (22, 6), (22, 26), (22, 29) -> <22, (11, 6, 26)>
- Node 23: (23, 15), (23, 8), (23, 2), (23, 1) -> <23, (15, 8, 2)>
- Node 24: (24, 21), (24, 18), (24, 19), (24, 13) -> <24, (21, 18, 19)>
- Node 25: (25, 8), (25, 4), (25, 29) -> <25, (8, 4, 29)>
- Node 26: (26, 1), (26, 22), (26, 18), (26, 13), (26, 12) -> <26, (1, 22, 18)>
- Node 27: (27, 4), (27, 28), (27, 5) -> No 3-star
- Node 28: (28, 21), (28, 27), (28, 18) -> <28, (21, 27, 18)>
- Node 29: (29, 15), (29, 9), (29, 22), (29, 25) -> <29, (15, 9, 25)>

Now we have all the unique 3-stars:
<1, (7, 23, 26)>, <2, (17, 23, 1)>, <3, (15, 17, 23)>, <4, (27, 2, 12)>, <6, (9, 22, 8)>, <7, (21, 20, 1)>, <8, (11, 6, 23)>, <9, (15, 6, 29)>, <12, (21, 26, 4)>, <13, (26, 20, 24)>, <15, (3, 23, 9)>, <17, (3, 20, 19)>, <18, (26, 28, 24)>, <20, (7, 14, 17)>, <21, (16, 7, 28)>, <22, (11, 6, 26)>, <23, (15, 8, 2)>, <24, (21, 18, 19)>, <25, (8, 4, 29)>, <26, (1, 22, 18)>, <28, (21, 27, 18)>, <29, (15, 9, 25)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
