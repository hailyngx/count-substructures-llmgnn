Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) 

Response:
The central nodes with three leaves are: 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13. Calculating the number of 3-stars for each central node:

1. (1, 2, 7, 9) -> <1, (2, 7, 9)>
2. (5, 4, 11, 8) -> <5, (4, 11, 8)>
3. (6, 3, 10, 14) -> <6, (3, 10, 14)>
4. (8, 5, 13, 12) -> <8, (5, 13, 12)>
5. (9, 1, 3, 2) -> <9, (1, 3, 2)>
6. (10, 11, 6, 13) -> <10, (11, 6, 13)>
7. (12, 10, 8, 0) -> <12, (10, 8, 0)>
8. (13, 1, 10, 4) -> <13, (1, 10, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
