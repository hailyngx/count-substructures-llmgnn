Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (27, 4) (27, 13) (27, 16) (14, 10) (17, 28) (17, 15) (17, 26) (22, 23) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 15) (6, 13) (6, 20) (28, 17) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 17) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 20) (7, 22) (7, 3) (7, 20) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 25) (4, 0) (4, 27) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 2) (10, 14) (10, 21) (10, 13) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 29) (8, 19) (8, 11) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 24) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 29) (29, 21) (29, 11) (29, 16) (29, 12) (1, 24) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 24) (20, 6) (20, 26) (20, 7) (20, 24) (9, 28) (9, 2) (9, 12) (25, 18) (25, 4) (15, 17) (15, 23) (16, 27) (16, 4) (16, 3) (16, 29) (5, 18) (5, 3) (12, 11) (12, 29) (12, 9) (24, 19) (24, 1) (24, 2) (24, 20) (13, 27) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided:

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 27, 16, and 25. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes, node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 27, 16)>.

- Node 26 is connected to nodes 17, 23, 28, 18, and 20. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes, node 26 forms two 3-stars: <26, (17, 23, 28)> and <26, (18, 20, 28)>.

- Node 7 is connected to nodes 22, 3, and 20. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes, node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (22, 3, 20)>.

- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, 21, and 13. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes, node 10 forms a 3-star: <10, (14, 21, 13)>.

- Node 19 is connected to nodes 28, 8, 11, and 24. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes, node 19 forms two 3-stars: <19, (28, 8, 11)> and <19, (8, 24, 11)>.

- Node 21 is connected to nodes 22, 10, and 29. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes, node 21 forms a 3-star: <21, (22, 10, 29)>.

- Node 29 is connected to nodes 21, 11, 16, and 12. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes, node 29 forms two 3-stars: <29, (21, 11, 16)> and <29, (11, 12, 16)>.

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 24. Since it is connected to exactly three other nodes, node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 9, 24)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
