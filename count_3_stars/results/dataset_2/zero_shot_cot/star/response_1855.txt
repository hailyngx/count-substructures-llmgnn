Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars using the given edges.

Looking at the edges, the nodes connected to node 6, for example, are 9, 1, 8, and 0. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, node 6 cannot be part of any 3-stars in this graph since it has 4 connections.

Similarly, for node 9, its connections are 6, 4, 1, and 7. Again, node 9 has 4 connections, so it cannot be part of a 3-star.

Continuing this process, we find that nodes {4, 7, 0, 2, 8} cannot be part of any 3-stars in this graph since they each have more than 3 connections.

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars in this graph involving the remaining nodes: {1, 3, 5}. We need to check each of these nodes to see if it forms a 3-star.

For node 1: (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 8) - It forms one 3-star: <1, (6, 9, 0)>
For node 3: (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 8) - It forms one 3-star: <3, (7, 1, 8)>
For node 5: (5, 2), (5, 8) - It does not form a 3-star since it only has 2 connections. 

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
So, the unique 3-stars found are <1, (6, 9, 0)> and <3, (7, 1, 8)>.
