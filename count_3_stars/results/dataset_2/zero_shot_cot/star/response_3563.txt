Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<6, (9, 8, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<4, (6, 9, 1)>
<4, (6, 8, 5)>
<8, (6, 9, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 0)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (6, 0, 2)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find that there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
