Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 7.
   - That forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 5, 7)>

2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 7.
   - That forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 8, 7)>

3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 5.
   - That forms a 3-star: <1, (3, 2, 5)>

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 2.
   - That forms a 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 2)>

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and does not have any other node connected to it.
   - Node 4 does not form a 3-star as it lacks a central node connected to 3 leaves.

6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 0.
   - That forms a 3-star: <8, (9, 5, 0)>

7. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 7.
   - That forms a 3-star: <0, (1, 8, 7)>

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 1.
   - That forms a 3-star: <7, (6, 9, 1)>

9. Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 3.
   - That forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (9, 5, 7)>,
<9, (6, 8, 7)>,
<1, (3, 2, 5)>,
<3, (1, 7, 2)>,
<8, (9, 5, 0)>,
<0, (1, 8, 7)>,
<7, (6, 9, 1)>,
<2, (9, 1, 3)>.
