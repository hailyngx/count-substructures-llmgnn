Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 18) (3, 16) (3, 12) (3, 4) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 12) (4, 3) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 5) (2, 15) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 19) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (19, 14) (19, 18) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 2) (16, 9) (16, 3) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 5) 

Response:
First, let’s identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes could be potential centers of 3-star graphs.

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them: 0, 2, 4, 8, 10

Next, let’s find all the possible 3-stars in the graph by considering each potential center node and checking their connections:

1. For node 0:
<0, (8, 13, 19)>
<0, (8, 13, 12)>

2. For node 2:
<2, (5, 11, 15)>
<2, (5, 11, 17)>
<2, (5, 15, 17)>

3. For node 4:
<4, (3, 10, 11)>
<4, (3, 10, 12)>

4. For node 8:
<8, (0, 13, 18)>
<8, (0, 13, 19)>

5. For node 10:
<10, (4, 12, 14)>
<10, (4, 12, 17)>
<10, (12, 14, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
