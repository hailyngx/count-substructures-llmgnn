Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-star.

The nodes that are directly connected to node 10 (the center) are: 1, 2, 9, 11, 12, and 13.

Among these, the nodes with exactly three edges connected to the center node 10 are: 1, 2, and 9. 

So, the possible 3-stars involving the center node 10 are:
<10, (1, 2, 13)>
<10, (1, 7, 13)>
<10, (1, 6, 14)>
<10, (2, 4, 6)>
<10, (2, 7, 13)>
<10, (9, 14, 0)>
<10, (9, 11, 8)>

There are a total of 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The count of 3-stars in this graph is [7].
