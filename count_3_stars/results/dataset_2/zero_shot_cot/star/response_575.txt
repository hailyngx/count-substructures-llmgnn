Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 8, 12)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 12)>
<4, (5, 6, 12)>
<5, (1, 4, 10)>
<6, (0, 3, 12)>
<7, (3, 9, 11)>
<8, (0, 1, 10)>
<9, (2, 7, 14)>
<10, (5, 8, 14)>
<11, (7, 11, 13)>
<12, (0, 3, 4)>
<13, (8, 11, 14)>
<14, (9, 10, 13)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [15].
