Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's analyze each node and its neighbors to see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 0: (1, 2, 7)
- Node 1: (0, 7, 9)
- Node 2: (0, 4, 6)
- Node 3: No 3-stars
- Node 4: (2, 5, 8)
- Node 5: (4, 6, 8)
- Node 6: (2, 5, 7)
- Node 7: (0, 1, 6)
- Node 8: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 9: (1, 6, 8)

Based on the analysis, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
