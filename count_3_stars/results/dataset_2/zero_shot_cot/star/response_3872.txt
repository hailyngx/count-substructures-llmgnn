Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (0, 9, 5)>
