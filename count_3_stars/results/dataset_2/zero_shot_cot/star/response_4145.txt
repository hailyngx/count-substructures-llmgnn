Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 11) (7, 9) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 6) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 19) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (18, 14) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 1) (12, 6) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 8) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (15, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (5, 10, 16)>
2. <1, (6, 10, 19)>
3. <2, (5, 11, 16)>
4. <3, (8, 13, 17)>
5. <4, (11, 15, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 2, 17)>
7. <6, (1, 8, 12)>
8. <9, (7, 11, 13)>
9. <10, (0, 1, 17)>
10. <11, (4, 2, 15)>
11. <13, (3, 9, 14)>
12. <14, (1, 13, 18)>
13. <15, (11, 14, 18)>
14. <16, (0, 2, 19)>
15. <17, (5, 10, 3)>
16. <18, (14, 15, 8)>
17. <19, (1, 16, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
