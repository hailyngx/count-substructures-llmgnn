Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star pattern. 

Examining the connections in the graph, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (5, 9, 10)>
<1, (4, 10, 12)>
<2, (10, 0, 1)>
<3, (8, 10, 13)>
<4, (0, 1, 14)>
<5, (11, 6, 9)>
<6, (5, 2, 3)>
<7, (12, 13, 8)>
<8, (3, 13, 12)>
<9, (5, 10, 6)>
<10, (9, 0, 12)>
<11, (5, 12, 11)>
<12, (10, 1, 7)>
<13, (8, 12, 3)>
<14, (4, 11, 1)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the total count of 3-stars is [14].
