Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes (candidates to be centers of 3-stars). 
- Node 0 is connected to 5 other nodes: 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes: 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes: 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 1, 4, and 7.

Step 2: Check if nodes connected to the potential center form a 3-star.
- For node 0: Check if nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 form a 3-star.
  <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- For node 1: Check if nodes 0, 4, 6, and 8 form a 3-star.
  <1, (0, 4, 8)>
- For node 3: Check if nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8 form a 3-star.
  <3, (2, 5, 6)>
- For node 6: Check if nodes 1, 2, 3, and 5 form a 3-star.
  <6, (1, 2, 3)>
- For node 9: Check if nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7 form a 3-star.
  <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars found in Step 2.
