Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 1) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
Initially, we can identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as these are potential central nodes of 3-stars. We find that nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, and 12 meet this criteria.

Next, we can find the leaves (nodes connected to the potential central node) connected to each of these central nodes. To form a valid 3-star, each of these leaves must not be directly connected to each other to avoid counting the same 3-star multiple times.

Let's go through the possible 3-stars involving these central nodes and their leaves to find the unique 3-stars:

For node 0: 
- Leaves: 1, 3, 6, 10, 11
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 10, 11)>, <0, (3, 6, 11)>

For node 2: 
- Leaves: 1, 7, 9, 14
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 9, 14)>, <2, (7, 9, 14)>

For node 4: 
- Leaves: 5, 9, 11, 14
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (5, 9, 11)>, <4, (5, 9, 14)>, <4, (11, 9, 14)>

For node 5: 
- Leaves: 1, 4, 8, 12
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 12)>, <5, (8, 4, 12)>

For node 7: 
- Leaves: 0, 6, 12, 2
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 6, 12)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 12, 2)>

For node 10: 
- Leaves: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Unique 3-stars: <10, (0, 2, 8)>, <10, (0, 8, 9)>, <10, (2, 8, 9)>

For node 11: 
- Leaves: 0, 3, 4, 6
- Unique 3-stars: <11, (0, 3, 4)>, <11, (0, 3, 6)>, <11, (4, 6, 3)>

For node 12: 
- Leaves: 3, 5, 7
- Unique 3-stars: <12, (3, 5, 7)>, <12, (3, 5, 12)>, <12, (3, 7, 12)>

Calculating the total count of unique 3-stars, we have 21 unique 3-stars in total. Thus, the final answer is [21].
