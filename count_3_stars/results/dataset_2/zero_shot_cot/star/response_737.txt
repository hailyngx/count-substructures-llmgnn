Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (19, 13) (2, 1) (2, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (14, 15) (14, 7) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 2) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 17, and 0: <3, (15, 17, 0)>
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 13, and 14: <15, (3, 13, 14)>
- Node 4 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 7 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 10 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 11 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9: <17, (3, 6, 9)>
- Node 8 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 12 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 18 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 1 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 19 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 2 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 17: <6, (3, 11, 17)>
- Node 0 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 14 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 9 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 5 is not a central node in any 3-star.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 15, 18, and 19: <13, (15, 18, 19)>
- Node 16 is not a central node in any 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars identified are: <<3, (15, 17, 0)>, <15, (3, 13, 14)>, <17, (3, 6, 9)>>.
