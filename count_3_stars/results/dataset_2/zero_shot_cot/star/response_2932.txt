Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 7) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- <1, (6, 9, 8)>
- <4, (9, 3, 11)>
- <5, (3, 7, 12)>
- <10, (6, 9, 0)>
- <13, (6, 9, 10)>
- <14, (8, 2, 1)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [6].
