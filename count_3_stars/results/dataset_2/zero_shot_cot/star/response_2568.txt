Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will start by identifying the possible 3-stars. 

1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1)
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 1)>

2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 7)
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>

3. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0)
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>

4. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 3)
<4, (9, 3, -)>

5. Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 7)
<8, (2, 1, 7)>

6. Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 3)
<2, (5, 6, 8)>

7. Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 1)
<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<0, (6, 2, 3)>
<0, (6, 1, 3)>

8. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3)
<7, (9, 8, 0)>

9. Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 0), (3, 7)
<3, (6, 4, 2)>
<3, (6, 4, 0)>
<3, (6, 2, 0)>
<3, (6, 7, 0)>

10. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 0)
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 0)>

Now, we count the total unique 3-stars:
