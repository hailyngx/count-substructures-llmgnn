Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 4) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 24) (6, 17) (6, 10) (3, 21) (3, 10) (25, 15) (25, 0) (18, 27) (18, 10) (18, 20) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 12) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 21) (29, 5) (29, 2) (29, 28) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (20, 9) (20, 18) (20, 2) (28, 22) (28, 29) (28, 15) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 7) (15, 25) (15, 28) (27, 9) (27, 18) (27, 14) (1, 26) (1, 0) (1, 8) (21, 3) (21, 2) (16, 24) (16, 17) (16, 14) (11, 5) (11, 23) (4, 26) (4, 22) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 16) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 16) (24, 7) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 23) (12, 19) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 14) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 13) (14, 27) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 13) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 9 to form 3-stars. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 20, and 27. So, we have the following 3-stars:
<9, (5, 20, 27)>, <9, (20, 5, 27)>, <9, (27, 20, 5)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 26 to form 3-stars. Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 9. We already counted the 3-star with node 9 as the center, so we don't need to count them again.

Moving on, let's look at the nodes connected to node 5 to form 3-stars. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 24. We already counted the 3-star with node 9 as the center, so we don't need to count them again.

Now, let's find the 3-stars with node 6 as the center. Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 17, and 5. We already counted the 3-star with node 5 as the center, so we don't need to count them again.

Continuing this process for all other nodes, we find that the only unique 3-stars are the ones we identified above. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
