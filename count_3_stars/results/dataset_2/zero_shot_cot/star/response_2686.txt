Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 3) (15, 13) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 14) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 19) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 12) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 17) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 17) (1, 10) (1, 19) (21, 2) (21, 29) (8, 23) (8, 19) (3, 15) (3, 13) (3, 18) (5, 6) (5, 25) (5, 10) (26, 28) (26, 16) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 4) (28, 10) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 29) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 8) (24, 27) (24, 16) (16, 0) (16, 26) (16, 24) (4, 28) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 14) (11, 7) (29, 21) (29, 7) (29, 14) (14, 27) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 0) (17, 23) (17, 4) (17, 2) (25, 6) (25, 5) (25, 14) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 28) (10, 2) (18, 3) (20, 6) (20, 9) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars first:
<0, (27, 7, 17)>
<2, (4, 17, 10)>
<3, (15, 13, 18)>
<4, (28, 17, 2)>
<5, (6, 25, 10)>
<6, (9, 20, 19)>
<7, (0, 11, 29)>
<8, (23, 19, 8)>
<9, (6, 20, 13)>
<10, (1, 28, 2)>
<12, (9, 14, 12)>
<14, (27, 22, 29)>
<15, (3, 13, 18)>
<16, (0, 26, 24)>
<17, (0, 23, 2)>
<19, (1, 8, 6)>
<20, (6, 9, 19)>
<21, (2, 29, 21)>
<22, (23, 14, 28)>
<24, (27, 16, 24)>
<25, (6, 5, 14)>
<26, (28, 16, 26)>
<27, (0, 14, 24)>
<28, (22, 4, 10)>
<29, (21, 7, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
