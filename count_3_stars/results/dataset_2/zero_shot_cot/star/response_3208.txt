Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (15, 14) (15, 16) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 18) (17, 6) (17, 18) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 17) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 12) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 13) (18, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

After examining the edges, we can identify the following 3-star graphs:
<0, (7, 9, 10)>
<3, (9, 14, 19)>
<4, (5, 10, 19)>
<5, (4, 10, 16)>
<7, (0, 16, 18)>
<9, (0, 12, 16)>
<10, (0, 4, 5)>
<11, (1, 2, 13)>
<12, (2, 9, 19)>
<13, (1, 14, 18)>
<14, (3, 13, 19)>
<15, (14, 16, 17)>
<16, (5, 7, 9)>
<18, (7, 13, 17)>
<19, (2, 4, 12)>

Counting the number of unique 3-star graphs, we find 15 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the answer is [15].
