Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 4) (11, 14) (11, 8) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 10) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 14)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 10, 13)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 13)>
<7, (10, 12, 14)>
<8, (3, 10, 14)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<10, (2, 7, 14)>
<11, (8, 11, 14)>
