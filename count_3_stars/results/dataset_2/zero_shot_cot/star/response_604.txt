Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 5:
   - <5, (9, 6, 2)>
   - <5, (9, 6, 3)>
   - <5, (9, 8, 2)>
   - <5, (9, 8, 3)>

2. Node 9:
   - <9, (5, 6, 1)>
   - <9, (5, 6, 4)>

3. Node 6:
   - <6, (5, 9, 1)>
   - <6, (5, 9, 4)>
   - <6, (4, 7, 0)>

4. Node 4:
   - <4, (6, 7, 1)>
   - <4, (6, 7, 8)>

5. Node 7:
   - <7, (4, 3, 2)>
   - <7, (4, 8, 2)>

6. Node 8:
   - <8, (5, 9, 0)>
   - <8, (5, 9, 7)>
   - <8, (4, 7, 0)>

7. Node 0:
   - <0, (6, 8, 1)>

8. Node 1:
   - <1, (9, 6, 4)>
   - <1, (9, 4, 3)>

9. Node 3:
   - <3, (5, 9, 7)>
   - <3, (5, 9, 4)>
   - <3, (4, 7, 2)>

10. Node 2:
   - <2, (5, 7, 8)>
   - <2, (7, 4, 3)>

The unique 3-stars found are: <<5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 6, 3)>, <5, (9, 8, 2)>, <5, (9, 8, 3)>, <9, (5, 6, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 4)>, <6, (5, 9, 1)>, <6, (5, 9, 4)>, <6, (4, 7, 0)>, <4, (6, 7, 1)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (4, 3, 2)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <8, (5, 9, 0)>, <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 0)>, <0, (6, 8, 1)>, <1, (9, 6, 4)>, <1, (9, 4, 3)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (4, 7, 2)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 4, 3)>>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
