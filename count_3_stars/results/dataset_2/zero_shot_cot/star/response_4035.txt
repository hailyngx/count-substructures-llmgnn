Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (18, 22) (18, 4) (22, 18) (22, 29) (22, 21) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 28) (11, 19) (11, 17) (11, 20) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 7) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 17) (21, 3) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 0) (21, 12) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 28) (0, 21) (0, 16) (0, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 25) (14, 26) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 29) (26, 25) (2, 15) (2, 27) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 21) (12, 13) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 19) (28, 9) (8, 15) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 29) (7, 20) (29, 22) (29, 26) (29, 7) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 13) (1, 9) (20, 11) (20, 26) (20, 7) (23, 1) (23, 25) (25, 16) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 23) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 1) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 27) (24, 17) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 24) (27, 3) (27, 2) (27, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify sets of nodes that form 3-stars.

Let's list the 3-stars based on the given edges:

1. <3, (15, 21, 28)>
2. <4, (18, 16, 17)>
3. <5, (19, 12, 7)>
4. <7, (5, 6, 29)>
5. <10, (21, 26, 28)>
6. <11, (19, 17, 20)>
7. <12, (5, 21, 13)>
8. <13, (12, 1, 27)>
9. <16, (4, 0, 25)>
10. <17, (11, 4, 24)>
11. <19, (11, 5, 28)>
12. <21, (3, 22, 10)>
13. <22, (18, 29, 21)>
14. <26, (10, 14, 20)>
15. <27, (3, 2, 13)>
16. <28, (3, 19, 9)>
17. <29, (22, 26, 7)>
18. <1, (25, 23, 13)>
19. <9, (0, 28, 1)>
20. <25, (16, 26, 1)>
21. <24, (17)>

There are a total of 21 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [21].
