Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars. We know that each 3-star consists of a center node and three leaf nodes. We will list all the possible 3-stars that can be formed in this graph.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

<0, (6, 3, 4)>
<1, (8, 7, 2)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (6, 0, 5)>
<4, (6, 0, 8)>
<5, (8, 4, 3)>
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 9, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (7, 8, 4)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
