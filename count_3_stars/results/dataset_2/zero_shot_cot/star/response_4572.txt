Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every 3-star present. 

Let's list down the 3-stars we find in the graph:
<0, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 7)>
<3, (4, 6, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<5, (9, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
