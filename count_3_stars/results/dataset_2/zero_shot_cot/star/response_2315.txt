Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 4) (23, 6) (5, 21) (5, 16) (6, 23) (6, 11) (6, 19) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 20) (4, 23) (4, 27) (4, 25) (18, 9) (18, 25) (18, 13) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 26) (29, 21) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 28) (11, 0) (11, 8) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 17) (14, 22) (14, 0) (27, 4) (27, 24) (27, 2) (1, 10) (15, 26) (15, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 24) (10, 20) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 21) (16, 25) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 0) (21, 16) (21, 20) (9, 7) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 0) (17, 0) (26, 29) (26, 15) (2, 27) (2, 10) (20, 22) (20, 12) (20, 28) (20, 10) (20, 21) (19, 6) (19, 24) (24, 27) (24, 10) (24, 19) (13, 18) (13, 9) (25, 4) (25, 18) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 8) (8, 22) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (17, 21, 28)>
<1, (2, 10, 24)>
<2, (1, 10, 27)>
<3, (0, 17, 21)>
<4, (23, 25, 27)>
<5, (16, 21, 29)>
<6, (11, 19, 23)>
<7, (9, 11, 12)>
<8, (15, 22, 25)>
<9, (7, 13, 18)>
<13, (9, 18, 25)>
<14, (0, 22, 27)>
<15, (8, 22, 26)>
<16, (5, 21, 28)>
<18, (9, 13, 25)>
<19, (6, 24, 27)>
<20, (10, 21, 28)>
<21, (0, 16, 28)>
<22, (0, 14, 20)>
<23, (4, 6, 22)>
<24, (10, 19, 27)>
<25, (8, 16, 28)>
<26, (15, 29, 26)>
<27, (4, 19, 24)>
<28, (5, 16, 25)>
<29, (5, 21, 26)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
[26]
