Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 16) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 12) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 15) (15, 13) (15, 11) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 6) (0, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (6, 8) (6, 17) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (14, 4) (14, 16) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 14) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:

Node 0: 18, 4, 10
Node 1: 9, 3, 4
Node 2: 17, 7
Node 3: 1, 11, 16
Node 4: 1, 0, 14
Node 5: 9, 13, 7
Node 6: 8, 17
Node 7: 5, 2, 12, 19, 10
Node 8: 18, 6
Node 9: 5, 16, 1
Node 10: 0, 7
Node 11: 3, 13, 19, 15
Node 12: 7, 3
Node 13: 5, 17, 11, 15
Node 14: 4, 16
Node 15: 13, 11
Node 16: 9, 3, 19, 14
Node 17: 2, 18, 13, 6
Node 18: 0, 17, 8
Node 19: 7, 11, 16

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 13, 7)>
<9, (5, 16, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 11, 16)>
<4, (1, 0, 14)>
<2, (17, 7, 6)>
<7, (5, 2, 12)>
<8, (18, 6, 17)>
<17, (2, 13, 6)>
<0, (18, 10, 4)>
<10, (0, 7, 11)>
<6, (8, 17, 7)>
<11, (3, 13, 19)>
<12, (7, 3, 19)>
<13, (5, 17, 11)>
<14, (4, 16)>
<15, (13, 11)>
<16, (9, 3, 19)>
<18, (0, 17, 8)>
<19, (7, 11, 16)>
