Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (17, 1) (17, 5) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 18) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 18) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 6) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (6, 15) (6, 19) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (4, 11) (4, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star involves one central node connected to three other nodes, we can start by checking each node if it is connected to exactly three other nodes.

After examining the graph and the edges provided, we can identify the 3-star structures:

<0, (2, 12, 14)>
<1, (5, 17, 18)>
<3, (7, 11, 15)>
<4, (11, 16, 16)>
<5, (17, 18, 19)>
<6, (15, 19, 6)>
<8, (10, 13, 8)>
<9, (14, 15, 16)>
<10, (11, 13, 8)>
<12, (14, 0, 18)>
<13, (2, 19, 10)>
<14, (12, 1, 9)>
<15, (3, 6, 9)>
<16, (9, 4, 16)>
<17, (5, 1, 18)>
<18, (17, 1, 5)>
<19, (5, 13, 6)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is therefore: [17].
