Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. (6, 1, 2, 6)
2. (9, 3, 13, 9)
3. (4, 7, 8, 4)
4. (7, 10, 14, 7)
5. (8, 0, 14, 8)
6. (3, 11, 14, 3)
7. (0, 12, 4, 0)
8. (1, 2, 14, 1)
9. (5, 4, 8, 5)
10. (2, 0, 3, 2)
11. (13, 12, 4, 13)
12. (10, 3, 5, 10)

Count of 3-stars: [12]
Unique 3-stars: 
<6, (1, 2, 6)>
<9, (3, 13, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 4)>
<7, (10, 14, 7)>
<8, (0, 14, 8)>
<3, (11, 14, 3)>
<0, (12, 4, 0)>
<1, (2, 14, 1)>
<5, (4, 8, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 2)>
<13, (12, 4, 13)>
<10, (3, 5, 10)>
