Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 10: <8, (4, 14, 10)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 12, 7, and 8: <13, (12, 7, 8)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 11, and 3: <10, (8, 11, 3)>
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 9: <11, (10, 14, 9)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 9: <4, (8, 12, 9)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 5, and 14: <6, (10, 5, 14)>
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 14, and 1: <0, (4, 14, 1)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6: <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 5, and 9: <3, (10, 5, 9)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 13, 6, and 14: <7, (13, 6, 14)>
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 4, and 3: <12, (13, 4, 3)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 0, and 14: <1, (8, 0, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars: [12]
