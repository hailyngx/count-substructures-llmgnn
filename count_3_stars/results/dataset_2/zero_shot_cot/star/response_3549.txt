Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 27) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 3) (29, 8) (6, 24) (6, 27) (6, 0) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 4) (26, 23) (26, 3) (26, 0) (0, 6) (0, 26) (0, 7) (0, 23) (0, 19) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 20) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 27) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 16) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 23) (21, 4) (21, 16) (21, 22) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 12) (24, 23) (23, 26) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 24) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 27) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 13) (19, 20) (3, 17) (3, 26) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 20) (20, 7) (20, 19) (20, 11) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 8) (27, 9) (27, 6) (27, 1) (27, 13) (8, 29) (8, 10) (8, 12) (25, 2) (22, 21) (2, 4) (2, 25) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (6, 26, 23)>
2. <1, (15, 10, 27)>
3. <2, (4, 25, 2)>
4. <3, (17, 26, 3)>
5. <4, (18, 21, 2)>
6. <5, (12, 15, 5)>
7. <6, (0, 26, 27)>
8. <7, (9, 14, 7)>
9. <8, (29, 10, 8)>
10. <11, (13, 12, 11)>
11. <13, (9, 11, 13)>
12. <16, (7, 15, 16)>
13. <19, (0, 14, 19)>
14. <20, (7, 19, 20)>
15. <21, (16, 22, 21)>
16. <23, (0, 16, 23)>
17. <24, (6, 16, 24)>
18. <27, (1, 13, 27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
