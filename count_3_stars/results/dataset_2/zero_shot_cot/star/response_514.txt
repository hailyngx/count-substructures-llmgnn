Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 7 has edges to nodes 4, 0, and 3.
- Node 9 has edges to nodes 7, 1, and 6.
- Node 6 has edges to nodes 1, 9, and 5.
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 7, 6, and 8.
- Node 0 has edges to nodes 4, 7, and 6.
- Node 2 has edges to nodes 7, 3, and 5.

Next, let's list the 3-stars:
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<9, (7, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (7, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<2, (7, 3, 5)>

There are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
