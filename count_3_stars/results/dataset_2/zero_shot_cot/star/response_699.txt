Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as potential center nodes of 3-stars. 
From the given edges, the nodes with 3 edges are: 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 1, 2, 8 (8 nodes in total). 

Now, let's check each potential center node with its connected nodes to see if they form a 3-star. 
Let's list all the 3-stars we find:
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 6)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<6, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<8, (9, 6, 3)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars listed above: 
[8]
