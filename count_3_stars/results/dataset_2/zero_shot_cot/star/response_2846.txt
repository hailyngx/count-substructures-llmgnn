Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 10) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 7) (1, 14) (1, 13) (5, 15) (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 12) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 16) (10, 6) (13, 1) (13, 18) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 13) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, we have found a 3-star. 

2. List the unique 3-stars:

<5, (9, 11, 15)>
<7, (2, 10, 17)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
<10, (6, 7, 14)>
<14, (1, 12, 10)>
<15, (0, 3, 12)>
<17, (4, 7, 19)>
<18, (0, 13, 3)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
