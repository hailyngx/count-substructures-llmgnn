Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 6) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Find all nodes with 3 edges (leaf nodes):
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 13, 12, and 11.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 4, 14, and 10.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 10, 4, and 12.
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 11 and 13.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 13, 4, and 14.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 8, 14, and 7.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 0, 11, and 12.
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 9 and 2.
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 8, 11, and 6.

2. Identify 3-star configurations:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 12, and 11: <5, (13, 12, 11)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 14, and 10: <9, (4, 14, 10)>
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star as it is missing a required edge.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 4, and 14: <8, (13, 4, 14)>
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star as it is missing an edge with one of its adjacent nodes.

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [3]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
