Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 21) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (22, 9) (22, 10) (24, 7) (24, 13) (26, 6) (26, 0) (26, 12) (4, 9) (4, 28) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 8) (16, 28) (16, 19) (28, 4) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 19) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 21) (10, 22) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 19) (0, 9) (0, 26) (0, 3) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 29) (18, 1) (18, 20) (18, 13) (6, 26) (6, 15) (29, 14) (29, 11) (12, 26) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 24) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 12) (2, 27) (2, 15) (2, 3) (2, 21) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 7) (20, 27) (20, 18) (20, 5) (25, 8) (25, 21) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 25) (5, 15) (5, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node in each potential 3-star. The central node must have exactly 3 edges connected to it. We can easily identify these nodes as nodes with degree 3 in the graph.

The nodes with degree 3 in the given graph are: 1, 15, and 29.

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars for each central node:

For node 1:
Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 11, and 18.

For node 15:
Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 6, and 5.

For node 29:
Node 29 is connected to nodes 14, 11, and 0.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].


The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (17, 11, 18)>
<15, (10, 6, 5)>
<29, (14, 11, 0)>
