Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 27) (8, 13) (8, 29) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 28) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 11) (20, 10) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 23) (7, 22) (12, 7) (12, 1) (1, 12) (26, 24) (26, 28) (26, 23) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 6) (28, 18) (24, 26) (24, 14) (24, 25) (24, 21) (17, 9) (17, 22) (21, 20) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 19) (2, 22) (2, 19) (22, 7) (22, 17) (22, 2) (22, 15) (14, 13) (14, 24) (14, 10) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 18) (16, 27) (15, 22) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 29) (15, 11) (19, 21) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (18, 28) (18, 23) (18, 15) (18, 25) (18, 3) (3, 5) (3, 20) (3, 18) (10, 20) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 27) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 15) (27, 9) (27, 16) (27, 10) (29, 8) (29, 15) (25, 24) (25, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes, creating potential 3-star structures.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 17, and 27.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 0, 21, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 12, and 23.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 5. (Note: This node connection creates a loop which is not a valid 3-star structure.)

Counting the number of valid 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 11, 3)>
- <9, (5, 17, 27)>
- <20, (0, 21, 3)>
- <7, (0, 12, 23)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
