Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (10, 6) (10, 0) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 1) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking at each node's connections.

From the given edges, we can list the 3-stars as follows:
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 14)>
<6, (9, 7, 10)>
<7, (6, 8, 11)>
<12, (9, 13, 14)>
<2, (13, 14, 11)>
<8, (6, 7, 11)>
<0, (5, 2, 14)>
<14, (9, 12, 2)>
<10, (6, 0, 13)>
<11, (7, 2, 8)>
<1, (5, 11, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<13, (6, 12, 2)>
<3, (5, 6, 12)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars listed above, which is 15.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
