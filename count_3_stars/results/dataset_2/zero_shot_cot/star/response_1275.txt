Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 19) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 17) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 8) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 15) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 5) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (15, 9) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 5) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 11) (5, 15) (13, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are directly connected to node 6:

<6, (12, 13)>

Next, we'll find all the nodes directly connected to node 9:

<9, (4, 15, 11, 19)>

Now, let's look at the nodes directly connected to node 1:

<1, (11, 4, 19, 12)>

Then, we'll list all the nodes directly connected to node 3:

<3, (17, 8)>

Moving on to the nodes directly connected to node 4:

<4, (9, 1, 7, 14, 16)>

Next, let's find all the nodes directly connected to node 7:

<7, (4, 12)>

Then, we'll list all the nodes directly connected to node 10:

<10, (17, 19, 14)>

Now, let's look at the nodes directly connected to node 17:

<17, (3, 10, 0, 12, 8)>

Moving on to the nodes directly connected to node 2:

<2, (5)>

Next, let's find all the nodes directly connected to node 8:

<8, (3, 17, 16)>

Then, we'll list all the nodes directly connected to node 0:

<0, (17, 5)>

Moving on to the nodes directly connected to node 14:

<14, (4, 10)>

Next, let's find all the nodes directly connected to node 16:

<16, (4, 8, 5)>

Now, let's look at the nodes directly connected to node 19:

<19, (9, 1, 10, 15)>

Moving on to the nodes directly connected to node 11:

<11, (9, 1, 5)>

Finally, we'll list all the nodes directly connected to node 15:

<15, (9, 12, 19, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars we found:
