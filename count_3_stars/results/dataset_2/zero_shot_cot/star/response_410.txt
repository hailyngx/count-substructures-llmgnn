Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (8, 1, 14)>
<7, (9, 6, 5)>
<6, (9, 11, 0)>
<9, (7, 6, 8)>
<10, (11, 8, 2)>
<11, (6, 10, 14)>
<8, (9, 10, 11)>
<0, (6, 5, -)>
<14, (4, 11, 12)>
<3, (13, 2, 5)>
<1, (4, 8, 14)>
<2, (10, 3, 1)>
<12, (9, 14, 3)>
<13, (9, 11, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
