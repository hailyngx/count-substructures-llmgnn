Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 6) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (8, 10, 1)>
<1, (5, 9, 13)>
<2, (8, 6, 3)>
<3, (2, 6, 14)>
<4, (5, 8, 13)>
<5, (1, 9, 7)>
<6, (12, 2, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 12)>
<8, (0, 10, 13)>
<9, (5, 1, 11)>
<10, (8, 0, 14)>
<11, (9, 14, 6)>
<12, (7, 12, 14)>
<13, (8, 4, 1)>
<14, (12, 10, 3)>

Now, to find the total number of 3-stars, we count the unique 3-stars we have identified.
