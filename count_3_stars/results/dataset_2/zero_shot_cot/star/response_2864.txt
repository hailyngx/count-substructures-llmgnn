Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 13) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, we can calculate the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 1
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 6
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 4
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 3

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<8, (1, 9, 5)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<6, (11, 10, 7)>
<0, (14, 3, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
