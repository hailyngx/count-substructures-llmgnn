Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 21) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 5) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 0) (9, 6) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (22, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 25) (12, 6) (12, 20) (12, 13) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 29) (28, 3) (28, 8) (13, 12) (26, 18) (26, 25) (26, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 23) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 28) (3, 21) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 3) (21, 19) (8, 11) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 29) (23, 18) (23, 10) (23, 29) (23, 15) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 15) (1, 25) (1, 29) (1, 19) (2, 25) (20, 27) (20, 12) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 23) (15, 24) (5, 27) (5, 22) (5, 24) (19, 21) (19, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-star graphs. 
- Node 11 has neighbors 7, 8, and 16.
- Node 27 has neighbors 0, 3, and 20.
- Node 10 has neighbors 7, 17, and 23.
- Node 4 has neighbors 14, 18, and 29.
- Node 25 has neighbors 1, 2, and 21.
- Node 8 has neighbors 11, 26, and 28.
- Node 15 has neighbors 0, 6, 14, and 24.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: 
<11, (7, 8, 16)>
<27, (0, 3, 20)>
<10, (7, 17, 23)>
<4, (14, 18, 29)>
<25, (1, 2, 21)>
<8, (11, 26, 28)>
<15, (0, 6, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
