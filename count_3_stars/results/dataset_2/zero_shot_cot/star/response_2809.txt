Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 18) (7, 0) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 1) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 1) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (10, 6) (10, 3) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 3) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 3) (1, 19) (1, 16) (1, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the graph. Let's identify them:
<9, (2, 13, 16)>
<15, (8, 16, 17)>
<1, (4, 14, 19)>
<3, (4, 6, 10)>
Results: [4]
