Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 6) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (0, 10) (14, 11) (14, 16) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 9) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 19) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 19) (3, 9) (15, 2) (15, 17) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 9) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 19)>
<7, (12, 9, 17)>
<9, (1, 3, 13)>
<17, (7, 13, 15)>
