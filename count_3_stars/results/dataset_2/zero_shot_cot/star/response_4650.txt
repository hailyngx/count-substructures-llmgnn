Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 16) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 10) (12, 3) (13, 18) (0, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

Node 14 is a central node connected to nodes 17, 1, and 7. <14, (17, 1, 7)>
Node 17 is a central node connected to nodes 14, 0, and 7. <17, (14, 0, 7)>
Node 10 is a central node connected to nodes 11, 12, and 8. <10, (11, 12, 8)>
Node 11 is a central node connected to nodes 10, 9, and 6. <11, (10, 9, 6)>
Node 8 is a central node connected to nodes 10, 11, and 4. <8, (10, 11, 4)>
Node 6 is a central node connected to nodes 11, 1, and 16. <6, (11, 1, 16)>
Node 9 is a central node connected to nodes 11, 18, and 15. <9, (11, 18, 15)>
Node 18 is a central node connected to nodes 9, 13, and 0. <18, (9, 13, 0)>
Node 3 is a central node connected to nodes 6, 7, and 12. <3, (6, 7, 12)>
Node 16 is a central node connected to nodes 8, 6, and 19. <16, (8, 6, 19)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
[9]
