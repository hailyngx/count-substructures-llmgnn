Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 24) (9, 16) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 21) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 15) (28, 8) (28, 11) (29, 14) (29, 10) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 15) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 27) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (21, 4) (21, 0) (21, 12) (0, 21) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 2) (23, 11) (23, 13) (23, 18) (14, 29) (14, 22) (14, 18) (26, 10) (26, 17) (2, 7) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 27) (22, 14) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 25) (10, 8) (10, 29) (10, 26) (19, 22) (19, 20) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 24) (16, 3) (24, 9) (24, 4) (24, 16) (24, 17) (1, 2) (1, 25) (20, 19) (20, 27) (18, 13) (18, 23) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 21) (12, 3) (25, 22) (25, 1) (17, 5) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 27) (3, 4) (3, 16) (3, 12) (27, 5) (27, 2) (27, 20) (27, 17) (15, 8) (15, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-stars. These nodes either have degree 3 or are connected to a node with degree 3.

Nodes with degree 3: 4, 8, 13, 16, 21, 24. 
Nodes connected to nodes with degree 3: 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (8, 21, 24)>
<8, (4, 15, 28)>
<13, (5, 16, 23)>
<16, (9, 13, 24)>
<21, (0, 4, 12)>
<24, (4, 16, 17)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: 6
