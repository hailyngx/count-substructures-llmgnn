Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the occurrences of 3-stars. 

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes: 3, 6, 8, 13, 14
   - Node 2 is connected to 5 other nodes: 6, 8, 9, 13, 14
   - Node 4 is connected to 2 other nodes: 7, 12
   - Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes: 6, 12, 13
   - Node 7 is connected to 5 other nodes: 3, 4, 10, 11, 14
   - Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 10, 11

2. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we find the combinations that meet this criteria:
   - <1, (3, 6, 8)>
   - <1, (3, 8, 13)>
   - <1, (6, 8, 13)>
   - <1, (8, 13, 14)>
   - <2, (6, 8, 13)>
   - <5, (6, 12, 13)>
   - <7, (3, 10, 14)>
   - <9, (2, 10, 11)>

3. Total number of 3-stars found: 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
