Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 
Given that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them by looking for nodes with exactly three edges. 
Calculating the degree of each node in the graph:

Node 0: 4 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 2: 3 edges
Node 3: 3 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 4 edges
Node 6: 4 edges
Node 7: 5 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 9: 5 edges

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we find [3].
