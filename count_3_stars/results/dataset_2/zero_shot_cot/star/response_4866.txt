Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-star configurations:

<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (9, 8, 1)>
<7, (9, 3, 1)>
<6, (9, 8, 0)>
<8, (4, 6, 0)>
<0, (6, 8, 3)>
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<2, (9, 0, 3)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
