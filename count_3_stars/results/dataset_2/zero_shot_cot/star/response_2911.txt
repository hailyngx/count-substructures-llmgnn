Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 11) 

Response:
The number of edges in this graph is given as 60. Since each 3-star consists of 4 nodes connected by 3 edges, counting the number of 3-stars can help verify if we have 60 edges.

Let's list out the 3-stars in the given graph and count them.
<1, (3, 9, 12)>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 13)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (2, 10, 11)>
<8, (4, 9, 13)>
<9, (1, 8, 14)>
<10, (7, 9, 14)>
<11, (6, 11, 14)>
<12, (0, 7, 14)>
<13, (3, 7, 8)>
<14, (10, 11, 12)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
