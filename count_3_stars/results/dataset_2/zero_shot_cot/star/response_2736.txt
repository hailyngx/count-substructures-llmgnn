Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 18) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 9) (17, 5) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 12) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 16) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (1, 10) (1, 16) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 9) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (19, 11) (19, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list them:
<3, (15, 10, 5)>
<15, (3, 9, 18)>
<14, (0, 6, 8)>
<17, (9, 5, 0)>
<10, (3, 8, 1)>
<11, (19, 0, 13)>
<2, (5, 7, N/A)>
<18, (15, 7, 12)>
<6, (14, 11, 13)>
<7, (2, 18, 12)>
<12, (18, 7, 0)>
<0, (14, 11, 7)>
<1, (10, 16, N/A)>
<8, (14, 10, 9)>
<9, (15, 17, 8)>
<4, (9, N/A, N/A)>
<19, (11, 7, N/A)>
<13, (11, 6, N/A)>
<16, (14, 6, 1)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars: 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
