Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars. 
Given that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<6, (9, 5, 2)>
<9, (8, 13, 1)>
<8, (9, 13, 2)>
<13, (9, 8, 4)>
<5, (6, 11, 10)>
<2, (6, 8, 13)>
<7, (13, 0, 3)>
<12, (6, 4, 10)>
<0, (7, 10, 3)>
<4, (13, 12, 10)>
<10, (5, 12, 0)>
<11, (6, 5, 12)>
<14, (8, 11, X)> (There's only one edge connected to 14, so the third leaf node cannot be determined)

Therefore, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
