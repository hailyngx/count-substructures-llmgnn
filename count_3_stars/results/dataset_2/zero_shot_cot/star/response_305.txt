Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Center node 0: 3-star with leaves 1, 7, and 2 (<0, (1, 7, 2)>)
- Center node 2: 3-star with leaves 5, 8, and 0 (<2, (5, 8, 0)>)
- Center node 3: 3-star with leaves 9, 4, and 1 (<3, (9, 4, 1)>)
- Center node 5: 3-star with leaves 9, 2, and 0 (<5, (9, 2, 0)>)
- Center node 6: 3-star with leaves 9, 4, and 1 (<6, (9, 4, 1)>)
- Center node 7: 3-star with leaves 9, 4, and 0 (<7, (9, 4, 0)>)
- Center node 9: 3-star with leaves 5, 6, and 8 (<9, (5, 6, 8)>)

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7] 3-stars.
