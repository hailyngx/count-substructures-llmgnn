Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 10) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 10) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:
- From node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 11)
- From node 9: (9, 5)
- From node 7: (7, 11), (7, 14), (7, 1)
- From node 12: (12, 14), (12, 0), (12, 11)
- From node 6: (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 8)
- From node 2: (2, 1), (2, 10), (2, 14)
- From node 11: (11, 5), (11, 7), (11, 12), (11, 2)
- From node 0: (0, 5), (0, 12), (0, 6)
- From node 3: (3, 12), (3, 6), (3, 0)
- From node 1: (1, 7), (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 13)
- From node 8: (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 1)
- From node 14: (14, 5), (14, 7), (14, 12), (14, 2)
- From node 4: (4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 13)
- From node 10: (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 8), (10, 4)
- From node 13: (13, 1), (13, 4)

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 6, 11)>
<7, (11, 14, 1)>
<12, (14, 0, 11)>
<6, (5, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 10, 14)>
<11, (5, 7, 12)>
<0, (5, 12, 6)>
<3, (12, 6, 0)>
<1, (7, 2, 0)>
<8, (6, 3, 1)>
<14, (5, 7, 12)>
<4, (5, 3, 13)>
<10, (2, 3, 8)>
<13, (1, 4)>

There are total [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
