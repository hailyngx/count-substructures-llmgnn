Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 27) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 15) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 18) (27, 1) (27, 28) (27, 3) (10, 26) (17, 19) (17, 2) (17, 7) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 29) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 23) (26, 21) (26, 10) (9, 25) (9, 4) (9, 28) (22, 1) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 25) (3, 27) (3, 11) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 20) (13, 19) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 18) (15, 1) (15, 21) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 29) (28, 27) (28, 9) (28, 16) (28, 4) (28, 18) (14, 11) (14, 12) (24, 5) (24, 16) (24, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 29) (7, 6) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 7) (25, 9) (25, 22) (25, 23) (25, 4) (6, 7) (6, 23) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 20) (20, 5) (20, 4) (20, 18) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 6) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 20) (18, 12) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the graph are:

<1, (15, 22, 27)>
<21, (0, 26, 15)>
<0, (21, 22, 18)>
<27, (1, 28, 3)>
<10, (26, 21, 0)>
<17, (19, 2, 7)>
<2, (17, 7, -)>
<8, (29, -1, -2)>
<19, (17, 13, 23)>
<9, (25, 4, 28)>
<16, (22, 28, 24)>
<11, (3, 14, 13)>
<5, (13, 24, 20)>
<14, (11, 12, -)>
<6, (7, 23, -3)>
<20, (5, 4, 18)>
<12, (14, 18, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
