Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 15) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 13) (1, 3) (1, 24) (21, 7) (21, 11) (21, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 17) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 26) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 28) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 19) (25, 27) (25, 3) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 23) (11, 21) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 29) (14, 21) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 27) (17, 6) (17, 5) (22, 4) (22, 15) (24, 1) (24, 6) (24, 29) (24, 20) (20, 24) (20, 29) (20, 2) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 20) (6, 17) (6, 24) (4, 0) (4, 22) (28, 0) (28, 8) (28, 7) (28, 2) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 16) (18, 27) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 15) (23, 9) (23, 10) (15, 9) (15, 22) (15, 18) (16, 14) (16, 2) (16, 19) (5, 17) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 16) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 13, 14, and 28: <8, (13, 14, 28)>
2. Node 10 can form a 3-star with nodes 11, 18, and 23: <10, (11, 18, 23)>
3. Node 11 can form a 3-star with nodes 10, 14, and 29: <11, (10, 14, 29)>
4. Node 13 can form a 3-star with nodes 8, 10, and 12: <13, (8, 10, 12)>
5. Node 14 can form a 3-star with nodes 8, 16, and 21: <14, (8, 16, 21)>
6. Node 18 can form a 3-star with nodes 10, 15, and 27: <18, (10, 15, 27)>
7. Node 19 can form a 3-star with nodes 7, 12, and 16: <19, (7, 12, 16)>
8. Node 24 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 29: <24, (1, 6, 29)>
9. Node 27 can form a 3-star with nodes 12, 17, and 25: <27, (12, 17, 25)>

Thus, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
