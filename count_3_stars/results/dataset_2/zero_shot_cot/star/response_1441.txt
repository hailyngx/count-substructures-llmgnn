Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars:
<5, (9, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<6, (9, 2, 0)>
<1, (9, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<2, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (6, 5, 3)>
<7, (1, 9, 3)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total, therefore the answer is [10].
