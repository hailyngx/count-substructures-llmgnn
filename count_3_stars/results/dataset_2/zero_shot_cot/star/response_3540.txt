Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 11) (14, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-star graphs found in the graph:

<3, (0, 12, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 13)>
<10, (5, 9, 0)>
<12, (3, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
