Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. **Identify Nodes Connected to Exactly Three Other Nodes:**
   - Node 9: (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7)
   - Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 0), (1, 7)
   - Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8)
   - Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 5)
   - Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 0)
   - Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 7), (5, 0)
   - Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 7)
   - Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 5)

2. **Identify 3-Stars:**
   - <9, (8, 4, 3)>
   - <1, (2, 5, 0)>
   - <4, (9, 7, 8)>
   - <7, (9, 1, 4)>
   - <8, (6, 9, 3)>
   - <5, (6, 1, 7)>
   - <2, (1, 3, 7)>
   - <0, (6, 1, 7)>

3. **Count the Number of Unique 3-Stars:**
   - Number of 3-stars = 8

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
