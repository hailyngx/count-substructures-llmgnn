Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 27) (16, 6) (20, 24) (25, 1) (25, 18) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 14) (27, 16) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 19) (8, 16) (8, 24) (8, 0) (23, 1) (23, 3) (15, 26) (15, 5) (15, 21) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 22) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 6) (26, 4) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 10) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 22) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (3, 23) (3, 7) (3, 14) (2, 22) (2, 9) (22, 19) (22, 1) (22, 2) (22, 21) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 29) (5, 15) (28, 4) (28, 10) (6, 16) (6, 26) (6, 0) (6, 18) (14, 12) (14, 3) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (21, 12) (21, 27) (21, 15) (21, 22) (29, 24) (4, 26) (4, 13) (4, 28) (18, 25) (18, 6) (10, 13) (10, 28) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes which have exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes will serve as potential central nodes for 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes with 3 neighbors are:
- Node 6 (neighbors: 16, 26, 0)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 16, 24, 0)
- Node 12 (neighbors: 27, 13, 21)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 12, 26, 4)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 11, 8, 6)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 11, 1, 9)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 12, 27, 15)
- Node 22 (neighbors: 19, 1, 2)
- Node 24 (neighbors: 20, 8, 29)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 15, 19, 6)
- Node 27 (neighbors: 16, 12, 21)

Next, we will count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

- Node 6: 1 3-star (6, 16, 26, 0)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 16, 24, 0)
- Node 12: 1 3-star (12, 27, 13, 21)
- Node 13: 1 3-star (13, 12, 26, 4)
- Node 16: 1 3-star (16, 11, 8, 6)
- Node 17: 0 3-stars
- Node 21: 1 3-star (21, 12, 27, 15)
- Node 22: 0 3-stars
- Node 24: 1 3-star (24, 20, 8, 29)
- Node 26: 1 3-star (26, 15, 19, 6)
- Node 27: 1 3-star (27, 16, 12, 21)

Finally, summing up all the 3-stars we found, we get:
