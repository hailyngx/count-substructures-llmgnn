Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (7, 6, 2)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<6, (4, 9, 8)>
<9, (7, 6, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (7, 9, 1)>
<8, (7, 6, 1)>
<5, (3, 2, -)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [8].
