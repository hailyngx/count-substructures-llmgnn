Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- For node 0: (0, 5, 8), (0, 2, 3) [<0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>]
- For node 1: (1, 4, 9), (1, 7, 8) [<1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>]
- For node 2: (2, 5, 6), (2, 0, 7) [<2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 2)>]
- For node 3: (3, 4, 7), (3, 0, -) [<3, (4, 7, -)>]
- For node 4: (4, 9, 1), (4, 6, 7), (4, 1, 3) [<4, (1, 3, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>]
- For node 5: (5, 6, 2), (5, 0, 8) [<5, (2, 6, 7)>]
- For node 6: (6, 5, 2), (6, 9, 4), (6, 2, 8) [<6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 9, 6)>]
- For node 7: (7, 4, 1), (7, 3, 2) [<7, (1, 4, 7)>]
- For node 8: (8, 9, 6), (8, 0, 1) [<8, (1, 6, 9)>]
- For node 9: (9, 6, 4), (9, 8, 1), (9, 4, -) [<9, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>]

Therefore, there are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [14].
