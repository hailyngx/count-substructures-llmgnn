Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 4, 7, 14, 10, 11, 6, 9, 2, 18, 0 as they have degrees greater than 2:
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 2, 7, 11, 15 
- Node 7 is connected to 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 14 is connected to 11, 16, 17
- Node 17 is connected to 5, 10, 14
- Node 10 is connected to 15, 17
- Node 11 is connected to 3, 4, 13, 14
- Node 6 is connected to 9, 12, 19
- Node 9 is connected to 6, 8, 12
- Node 2 is connected to 1, 4, 13
- Node 18 is connected to 12, 15
- Node 0 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 16

Next, let's list the 3-stars:
<4, (0, 2, 15)>
<4, (7, 11, 15)>
<4, (11, 13, 15)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<14, (16, 11, 17)>
<17, (5, 10, 14)>
<17, (10, 14, 5)>
<10, (15, 17, 14)>
<11, (3, 13, 14)>
<6, (9, 12, 6)>
<9, (8, 6, 12)>
<2, (1, 4, 13)>
<18, (15, 12, 18)>
<0, (1, 3, 16)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars found in the graph.
