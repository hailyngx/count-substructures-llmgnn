Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-star structures in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-star structures in this graph:

<5, (1, 4, 0)>
<9, (6, 8, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (9, 1, 4)>
<0, (5, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 9 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
