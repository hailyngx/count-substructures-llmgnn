Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 5) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 0) (13, 6) (23, 15) (23, 8) (23, 4) (26, 28) (26, 14) (26, 21) (28, 26) (28, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 16) (19, 21) (19, 6) (19, 9) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 9) (16, 13) (16, 1) (21, 26) (21, 19) (21, 2) (21, 17) (29, 1) (2, 21) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 11) (5, 27) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 24) (3, 12) (17, 21) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 11) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 17) (9, 25) (25, 9) (25, 12) (22, 14) (24, 13) (24, 3) (24, 10) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 18) (6, 20) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 24) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 12) (4, 23) (18, 6) (20, 2) (20, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a single node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
<15, (27, 1, 23)>
<27, (15, 3, 5)>
<13, (8, 16, 24)>
<23, (15, 8, 4)>
<26, (28, 14, 21)>
<0, (13, 7, 6)>
<7, (8, 0, 6)>
<1, (15, 29, 16)>
<21, (26, 19, 2)>
<2, (21, 5, 20)>
<5, (27, 2, 12)>
<3, (27, 17, 24)>
<17, (21, 3, 9)>
<9, (28, 19, 14)>
<12, (5, 3, 25)>
<24, (13, 3, 10)>
<6, (13, 7, 19)>
<11, (2, 17, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: [18]
