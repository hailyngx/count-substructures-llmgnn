Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 10) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (1, 6, 2)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<8, (4, 9, 14)>
<13, (11, 5, 0)>
<12, (10, 3, 14)>
