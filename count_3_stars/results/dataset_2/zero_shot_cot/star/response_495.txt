Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<4, (7, 8, 6)>
