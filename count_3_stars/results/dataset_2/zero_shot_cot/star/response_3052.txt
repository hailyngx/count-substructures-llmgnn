Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we will look for each node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's list the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 4)
- Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 0)
- Node 4: (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 5)
- Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 1), (9, 7)

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 have exactly 3 edges connected to them, making them the centers of 3-stars. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (1, 5, 2)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (3, 2, 5)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
