Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 16) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 19) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 7) (13, 16) (13, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 14) (9, 8) (9, 18) (17, 19) (17, 15) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 10) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 15) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 16) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 19)>
<3, (1, 0, 12)>
<4, (1, 6, 18)>
<7, (0, 11, 15)>
<12, (2, 10, 16)>
