Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 11) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 19) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 6) (15, 10) (15, 8) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph based on the given edges:
<5, (9, 13, 8)>
<9, (5, 11, 10)>
<14, (17, 10, 15)>
<17, (14, 10, 10)>  (this star contains a duplicate node 10)
<10, (14, 11, 15)>
<11, (9, 10, 7)>
<8, (5, 15, 0)>
<13, (5, 16, 3)>
<4, (12, 19, 3)>
<7, (11, 12, 16)>
<12, (10, 4, 3)>
<0, (19, 0, 0)> (this star contains a duplicate node 0)
<2, (7, 19, 3)>
<1, (10, 6, 1)>
<15, (10, 8, 0)>
<6, (11, 1, 19)>
<16, (13, 7, 19)>
<19, (4, 0, 2)>
<3, (13, 4, 12)>
<18, (7, 3, 7)>

Counting all the identified unique 3-stars, we get a total of [19] 3-star graphs.
