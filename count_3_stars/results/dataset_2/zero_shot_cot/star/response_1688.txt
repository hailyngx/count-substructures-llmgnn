Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
After analyzing the given graph, we can list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 10, 12)>
<1, (0, 9, 14)>
<2, (5, 6, 14)>
<3, (5, 11, 12)>
<4, (8, 10, 13)>
<5, (2, 3, 12)>
<6, (2, 10, 14)>
<7, (1, 5, 14)>
<8, (4, 13, 10)>
<9, (1, 3, 12)>
<10, (1, 4, 6)>
<11, (3, 5, 7)>
<12, (0, 3, 5)>
<13, (4, 8, 9)>
<14, (1, 2, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph gives us a total of [14].
