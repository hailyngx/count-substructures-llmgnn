Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 22) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 26) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 26) (8, 25) (8, 0) (8, 26) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 27) (12, 25) (12, 15) (12, 9) (28, 11) (28, 19) (5, 21) (5, 27) (13, 21) (20, 23) (20, 22) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 19) (1, 17) (1, 19) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 23) (27, 5) (27, 25) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 24) (19, 14) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 1) (21, 5) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 2) (6, 23) (6, 29) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 22) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 21) (29, 14) (29, 25) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 7) (26, 17) (26, 8) (26, 29) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 3) (10, 18) (18, 16) (18, 21) (18, 10) (2, 15) (2, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 16.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 19, and 21.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 22, and 24.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 21, and 27.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 23, 29, and 27.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 22, and 28.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 19, and 29.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 12, and 24.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 16, and 21.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 29.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- There are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. Thus, the answer is [10].

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (8, 9, 16)>
<1, (17, 19, 21)>
<3, (4, 22, 24)>
<5, (13, 21, 27)>
<6, (23, 29, 27)>
<11, (16, 22, 28)>
<14, (17, 19, 29)>
<15, (2, 12, 24)>
<18, (10, 16, 21)>
<25, (8, 12, 29)>
