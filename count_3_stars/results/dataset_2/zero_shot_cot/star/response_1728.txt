Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (12, 7) (12, 15) (12, 3) (2, 18) (5, 6) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 3) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 14) (1, 4) (1, 6) (9, 13) (9, 18) (9, 3) (3, 12) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 19) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 17) (16, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected in the specific 3-star pattern.

Let's find the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 3, 7, and 10. <0, (3, 7, 10)>
2. Node 4 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 1, 8, and 15. <4, (1, 8, 15)>
3. Node 6 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 1, 5, and 11. <6, (1, 5, 11)>
4. Node 12 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 3, 7, and 15. <12, (3, 7, 15)>
5. Node 14 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 6, 16, and 18. <14, (6, 16, 18)>
6. Node 17 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 10, 11, and 16. <17, (10, 11, 16)>
7. Node 18 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 2, 9, and 14. <18, (2, 9, 14)>

There are total [7] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
