Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique 3-stars. 

Analyzing the graph:

- Node 5 has edges with nodes 9, 4, 0, 3, 10, and 14.
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 5, 8, 2, and 1.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 5, 7, 0, 14, and 11.

Considering the above connections, we find the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<5, (9, 4, 10)>
<5, (9, 4, 14)>

Thus, there are [4] 3-stars in total.
