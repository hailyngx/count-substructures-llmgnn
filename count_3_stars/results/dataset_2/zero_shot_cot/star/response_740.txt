Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 5) (4, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 15) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 15) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 18) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 2) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 18) (16, 9) (16, 3) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars and then count them.

All possible 3-stars:
<0, (10, 12, 18)>
<1, (10, 11, 14)>
<2, (7, 8, 15)>
<2, (11, 13, 2)>
<3, (5, 16, 17)>
<4, (19, 5, 15)>
<5, (3, 12, 18)>
<6, (15, 19, 6)>
<7, (2, 8, 15)>
<8, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (16, 19, 9)>
<10, (0, 11, 14)>
<11, (1, 2, 10)>
<12, (0, 5, 15)>
<14, (1, 10, 19)>
<15, (2, 6, 12)>
<16, (3, 9, 18)>
<17, (3, 5, 14)>
<18, (0, 5, 16)>
<19, (4, 14, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [20]
