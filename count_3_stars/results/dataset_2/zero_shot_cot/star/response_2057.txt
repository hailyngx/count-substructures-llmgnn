Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 14) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 14, 13)>
<2, (0, 10, 17)>
<3, (1, 16, 4)>
<4, (3, 5, 16)>
<5, (4, 8, 12)>
<6, (2, 10, 14)>
<10, (2, 6, 15)>
<12, (5, 19, 18)>
<13, (1, 8, 14)>
<14, (1, 13, 15)>
<15, (10, 14, 18)>
<16, (1, 3, 8)>
<17, (2, 7, 13)>
<18, (12, 15, 19)>
<19, (8, 10, 12)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
