Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 20) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 25) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 27) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 27) (17, 21) (1, 26) (1, 19) (3, 28) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 20) (25, 23) (13, 11) (13, 4) (22, 20) (12, 5) (12, 21) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 10) (27, 19) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 15) (29, 17) (29, 4) (29, 18) (19, 1) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 6) (24, 9) (24, 26) (10, 27) (10, 7) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 23) (28, 3) (28, 18) (21, 17) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 23) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 19) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 6) (7, 18) (4, 13) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 23) (8, 20) (8, 21) (23, 25) (23, 0) (23, 21) (23, 4) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify the nodes with degree 3 (connected to exactly three other nodes):
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 13, 6, 20, 25.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 20, 23.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 11, 25, 8, 22.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 11, 14, 19, 7.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 14, 17, 10, 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 1, 27, 26, 4, 6.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 17, 4, 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 29, 15, 28, 7.

2. For each of the identified nodes, list the unique 3-stars:
- <11, (16, 13, 6)>
- <11, (16, 6, 20)>
- <11, (16, 6, 25)>
- <11, (13, 6, 20)>
- <11, (13, 6, 25)>
- <11, (20, 6, 25)>
- <25, (11, 16, 20)>
- <25, (11, 16, 23)>
- <25, (11, 20, 23)>
- <20, (11, 25, 8)>
- <20, (11, 25, 22)>
- <6, (11, 14, 19)>
- <6, (11, 19, 7)>
- <27, (14, 17, 10)>
- <27, (14, 17, 19)>
- <27, (17, 10, 19)>
- <19, (1, 27, 26)>
- <19, (1, 27, 4)>
- <19, (1, 26, 6)>
- <19, (27, 26, 4)>
- <19, (27, 4, 6)>
- <29, (17, 4, 18)>
- <18, (29, 15, 28)>
- <18, (29, 15, 7)>
- <18, (15, 28, 7)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [24]
