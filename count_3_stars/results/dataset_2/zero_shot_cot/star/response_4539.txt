Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in the graph given. To count the number of unique 3-stars, we need to consider nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Looking at the connections, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<9, (8, 1, 7)>
<1, (9, 6, 3)>
<3, (1, 4, 0)>
<4, (5, 3, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 0)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<2, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (9, 8, 2)>
<0, (5, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
