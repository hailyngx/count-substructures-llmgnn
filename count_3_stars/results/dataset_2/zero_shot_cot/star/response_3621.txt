Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:

- Node 0: 6, 2, 7
- Node 1: 9, 3, 5, 7
- Node 2: 9, 1, 4, 7, 0
- Node 3: 6, 1, 7, 5, 4
- Node 4: 9, 3, 5, 2
- Node 5: 6, 1, 3, 4
- Node 6: 9, 5, 3, 0
- Node 7: 1, 3, 2, 8, 0
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 6, 4, 2, 1

Now, letâ€™s count the number of 3-star configurations:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, 5: <1, (9, 3, 5)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, 7: <3, (6, 1, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, 3: <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, 2: <7, (1, 3, 2)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 2: <9, (1, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
