Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 6) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (11, 16, 15)>
<1, (11, 12, 13)>
<2, (4, 17, 14)>
<3, (14, 9, 5)>
<4, (8, 2, 6)>
<5, (13, 15, 14)>
<6, (8, 10, 18)>
<7, (12, 13, 14)>
<8, (4, 6, 18)>
<9, (3, 17, 1)>
<10, (6, 8, 18)>
<11, (1, 19, 15)>
<12, (7, 1, 13)>
<13, (5, 1, 7)>
<14, (3, 5, 7)>
<15, (0, 11, 18)>
<16, (0, 11, 15)>
<17, (2, 9, 19)>
<18, (8, 6, 15)>
<19, (11, 17, 1)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [19].
