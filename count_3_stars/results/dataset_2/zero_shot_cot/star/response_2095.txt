Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes that have degree 4.
Nodes with degree 4: 4, 9, 13

Step 2: For each node with degree 4, determine if it forms a 3-star. A 3-star is formed if the node is connected to three other nodes that are not directly connected to each other.

For node 4:
(4, 5, 13, 12) - This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center. <4, (5, 13, 12)>
(4, 12, 14, 3) - This also forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center. <4, (12, 14, 3)>

For node 9:
(9, 5, 13, 1) - This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center. <9, (5, 13, 1)>
(9, 10, 2, 1) - This also forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center. <9, (10, 2, 1)>

For node 13:
(13, 5, 9, 1) - This forms a 3-star with node 13 as the center. <13, (5, 9, 1)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars.
Number of 3-stars = 4

Therefore, the answer is [4].
