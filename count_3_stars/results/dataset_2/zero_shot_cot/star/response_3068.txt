Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (4, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (9, 7, 14)>
2. <1, (11, 7, 12)>
3. <2, (10, 8, 14)>
4. <3, (6, 8, 14)>
5. <4, (11, 8, 1)>
6. <6, (9, 14, 10)>
7. <7, (10, 12, 1)>
8. <8, (11, 2, 3)>
9. <9, (6, 0, 2)>
10. <10, (7, 11, 6)>
11. <11, (10, 1, 13)>
12. <12, (7, 13, 1)>
13. <13, (12, 11, 3)>
14. <14, (2, 8, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
