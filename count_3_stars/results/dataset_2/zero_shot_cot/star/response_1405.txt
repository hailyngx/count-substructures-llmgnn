Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (0, 17) (0, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 2) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes with exactly three neighboring nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 14, 17)>
<2, (6, 15, 19)>
<3, (1, 10, 16)>
<4, (12, 16, 19)>
<5, (8, 13, 19)>
<6, (2, 17, 19)>
<8, (5, 7, 13)>
<9, (10, 12, 16)>
<10, (3, 9, 11)>
<12, (4, 9, 16)>
<13, (5, 8, 19)>
<14, (0, 17, 18)>
<15, (2, 10, 16)>
<16, (3, 4, 9)>
<17, (0, 6, 14)>
<19, (4, 6, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
