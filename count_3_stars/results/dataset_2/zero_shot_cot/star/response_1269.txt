Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 15) (3, 1) (3, 5) (15, 26) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 21) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 0) (17, 27) (6, 10) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 21) (28, 4) (28, 22) (28, 19) (28, 18) (29, 9) (29, 20) (29, 27) (29, 21) (22, 26) (22, 28) (22, 5) (22, 0) (20, 4) (20, 17) (20, 29) (25, 17) (25, 16) (27, 17) (27, 29) (16, 25) (16, 21) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 19) (21, 15) (21, 8) (21, 29) (21, 16) (23, 19) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 19) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 16) (18, 19) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 23) (19, 12) (19, 18) (24, 12) (24, 13) (24, 5) (24, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 24) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 22) (5, 3) (5, 22) (5, 24) (5, 10) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 13) (13, 14) (13, 24) (13, 10) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (1, 5, 2)>
<4, (7, 28, 20)>
<7, (4, 2, 28)>
<8, (6, 21, 16)>
<12, (16, 24, 19)>
<13, (14, 10, 24)>
<14, (26, 17, 13)>
<15, (26, 0, 18)>
<16, (25, 21, 12)>
<17, (20, 25, 0)>
<18, (15, 28, 19)>
<19, (28, 23, 12)>
<20, (29, 17, 4)>
<21, (15, 8, 29)>
<22, (26, 5, 0)>
<24, (12, 5, 13)>
<25, (16, 17, 0)>
<26, (22, 14, 15)>
<28, (22, 18, 19)>
<29, (9, 27, 21)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we have [(20)].
