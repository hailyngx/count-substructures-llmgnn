Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all sets of four nodes where one is connected to the other three. Then, we determine if the remaining nodes are connected to each other or not. 

Let's start by identifying the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 9, 11, 2, 14, 3, 1
- Node 1: 6, 9, 0, 5, 13
- Node 2: 9, 8, 14, 0
- Node 3: 10, 0, 5
- Node 4: 7, 12, 10, 14
- Node 5: 11, 8, 3, 12, 1
- Node 6: 9, 1, 8
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 7, 6, 2, 5, 12
- Node 9: 6, 2, 1, 0
- Node 10: 4, 11, 3, 14
- Node 11: 10, 0, 13, 5
- Node 12: 4, 8, 13, 5
- Node 13: 11, 12, 1
- Node 14: 4, 10, 2, 0

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

1. <0, (9, 11, 2)> [1]
2. <1, (6, 9, 0)> [2]
3. <2, (9, 8, 14)> [3]
4. <3, (10, 0, 5)> [4]
5. <4, (7, 12, 10)> [5]
6. <5, (11, 8, 3)> [6]
7. <6, (9, 1, 8)> [7]
8. <8, (7, 6, 2)> [8]
9. <9, (6, 2, 1)> [9]
10. <10, (4, 11, 3)> [10]
11. <11, (10, 0, 13)> [11]
12. <12, (4, 8, 13)> [12]
13. <13, (11, 12, 1)> [13]
14. <14, (4, 10, 2)> [14]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
