Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 8) (7, 5) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 16) (15, 14) (15, 12) (15, 4) (19, 13) (19, 10) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 13) (6, 12) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 15) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (10, 16) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph. We will then count the total number of unique 3-stars.

1. Node 1 has connections to nodes 3, 12, and 8: <1, (3, 12, 8)>
2. Node 2 has connections to nodes 8, 16, and 4: <2, (8, 16, 4)>
3. Node 4 has connections to nodes 2, 9, and 15: <4, (2, 9, 15)>
4. Node 5 has connections to nodes 7, 11, and 10: <5, (7, 11, 10)>
5. Node 13 has connections to nodes 14, 17, and 19: <13, (14, 17, 19)>
6. Node 16 has connections to nodes 2, 9, and 18: <16, (2, 9, 18)>
7. Node 18 has connections to nodes 17, 11, and 16: <18, (17, 11, 16)>
  
Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
