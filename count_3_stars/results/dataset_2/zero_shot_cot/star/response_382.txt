Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 18) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 18) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0: {6, 3, 9}
- Node 1: {15, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {10, 5, 11}
- Node 3: {19, 14, 0}
- Node 4: {8, 5, 16}
- Node 5: {17, 4, 2}
- Node 7: {13, 10, 5}
- Node 8: {13, 4, 14}
- Node 10: {17, 7, 2}
- Node 11: {19, 2, 9}
- Node 12: {17, 8, 18}
- Node 13: {15, 8, 7}
- Node 15: {13, 1, 16}
- Node 16: {4, 15, 18}
- Node 17: {10, 12, 5}
- Node 18: {12, 16, 3}
- Node 19: {11, 3, 14}

Next, let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 3, 9)>
<1, (15, 6, 9)>
<2, (10, 5, 11)>
<3, (19, 14, 0)>
<4, (8, 5, 16)>
<5, (17, 4, 2)>
<7, (13, 10, 5)>
<8, (13, 4, 14)>
<10, (17, 7, 2)>
<11, (19, 2, 9)>
<12, (17, 8, 18)>
<13, (15, 8, 7)>
<15, (13, 1, 16)>
<16, (4, 15, 18)>
<17, (10, 12, 5)>
<18, (12, 16, 3)>
<19, (11, 3, 14)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
