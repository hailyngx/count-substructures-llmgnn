Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 15) (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 19) (1, 29) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (25, 15) (25, 21) (8, 13) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 18) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 21) (12, 22) (12, 15) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 15) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 11) (23, 17) (10, 16) (10, 22) (10, 20) (21, 16) (21, 25) (21, 12) (24, 18) (24, 14) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 0) (17, 6) (17, 23) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 29) (19, 6) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 2) (27, 8) (27, 2) (27, 29) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 24) (22, 12) (22, 10) (28, 12) (28, 2) (28, 20) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 18) (18, 13) (18, 24) (18, 5) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 1) (20, 10) (20, 28) 

Response:
First, we identify all the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 
We see that nodes 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, and 29 satisfy this condition.

Let's count the number of 3-stars by considering each of the identified nodes as the center:

For node 13: (8, 15, 18), (7, 13, 14), (27, 13, 15) <13, (8, 15, 18)>, <13, (7, 13, 14)>, <13, (27, 13, 15)>
For node 14: (13, 18, 24), (7, 14, 29), (15, 14, 12) <14, (13, 18, 24)>, <14, (7, 14, 29)>, <14, (15, 14, 12)>
For node 15: (12, 21, 15), (26, 15, 25), (13, 15, 14), (15, 2, 27), (15, 12, 22) <15, (12, 21, 15)>, <15, (26, 15, 25)>, <15, (13, 15, 14)>, <15, (15, 2, 27)>, <15, (15, 12, 22)>
For node 16: (10, 21, 16), (4, 16, 11), (16, 10, 22), (16, 4, 21) <16, (10, 21, 16)>, <16, (4, 16, 11)>, <16, (16, 10, 22)>, <16, (16, 4, 21)>
For node 21: (25, 21, 12), (12, 21, 16), (21, 16, 4) <21, (25, 21, 12)>, <21, (12, 21, 16)>, <21, (21, 16, 4)>
For node 29: (27, 29, 7), (5, 29, 1), (29, 7, 14) <29, (27, 29, 7)>, <29, (5, 29, 1)>, <29, (29, 7, 14)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 11.
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
