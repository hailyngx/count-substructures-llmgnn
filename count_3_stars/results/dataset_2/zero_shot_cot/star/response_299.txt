Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 17) (9, 18) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 11) (0, 1) (16, 5) (16, 17) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 6) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 11) (3, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 12) (6, 2) (6, 7) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 17) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (18, 9, 12)>
<5, (19, 16, 17)>
<7, (8, 15, 6)>
<11, (15, 14, 12)>
<12, (18, 11, 17)>
<13, (10, 3, 2)>
<14, (4, 8, 5)>
<15, (10, 7, 11)>
<17, (19, 16, 12)>
<18, (2, 9, 3)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, which is [10].
