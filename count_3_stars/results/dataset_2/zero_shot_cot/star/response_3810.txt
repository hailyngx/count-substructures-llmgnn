Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 17) (15, 11) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 18) (19, 8) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 13) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 18) (12, 3) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 11) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 16) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 17) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 9) (9, 14) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors to determine the potential center nodes of 3-stars. These nodes will be our central nodes. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 15, 7, 16)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 8, 5, 13)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 15, 10, 12)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 16, 14, 13)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 16, 14, 11)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 10, 2)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 19, 5, 1)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 15, 6, 18)
- Node 13 (neighbors: 1, 4, 18)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 6, 9, 4)
- Node 15 (neighbors: 3, 0, 17)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 0, 18, 4)
- Node 18 (neighbors: 8, 16, 10, 13, 11)

Next, for each potential center node found above, we will check if they form 3-stars with their neighbors. We will consider all possible combinations of the center nodes and their corresponding neighbors. 

By examining the connections, we find that the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (15, 7, 16)>
<1, (8, 5, 13)>
<3, (15, 10, 12)>
<4, (16, 14, 13)>
<6, (16, 14, 11)>
<7, (0, 10, 2)>
<16, (0, 18, 4)>

Therefore, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
