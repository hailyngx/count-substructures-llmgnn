Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) 

Response:
Let's first identify the center nodes in the graph. The nodes with degree 3 will be the central nodes. From the given edge list, we can see that nodes 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 have degree 3.

Now, let's identify the leaves for each central node to form 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Leaves: 14, 8, 4
<6, (14, 8, 4)>

For node 8:
- Leaves: 6, 10, 4
<8, (6, 10, 4)>

For node 9:
- Leaves: 2, 14, 3
<9, (2, 14, 3)>

For node 10:
- Leaves: 11, 12, 8
<10, (11, 12, 8)>

For node 11:
- Leaves: 10, 13, 7
<11, (10, 13, 7)>

For node 13:
- Leaves: 6, 11, 4
<13, (6, 11, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [6].
