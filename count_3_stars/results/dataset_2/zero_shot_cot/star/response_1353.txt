Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 27) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 2) (27, 16) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 1) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 2) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 26) (25, 28) (25, 10) (15, 20) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 18) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 19) (29, 13) (24, 26) (24, 7) (26, 25) (26, 24) (9, 25) (9, 21) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 22) (8, 7) (19, 29) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 23) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (21, 16) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 14) (5, 8) (5, 2) (14, 21) (2, 0) (2, 20) (2, 5) (2, 22) (22, 16) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 10) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 27) (1, 18) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 17) (23, 4) (6, 10) (10, 25) (10, 22) (10, 6) (18, 27) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 1) (13, 27) (13, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the edges provided:

<11, (16, 7, 1)>
<16, (11, 21, 22)>
<0, (27, 28, 2)>
<27, (16, 0, 18)>
<20, (25, 15, 12)>
<25, (20, 9, 26)>
<15, (20, 12, 17)>
<17, (29, 28, 12)>
<29, (17, 7, 19)>
<24, (26, 7, 0)>
<26, (25, 24, 7)>
<9, (25, 21, 0)>
<8, (11, 19, 5)>
<19, (29, 8, 7)>
<4, (12, 23, 0)>
<12, (20, 17, 4)>
<21, (16, 0, 9)>
<5, (8, 2, 0)>
<14, (21, 0, 0)>
<2, (0, 20, 5)>
<22, (16, 8, 2)>
<7, (11, 29, 24)>
<1, (11, 27, 18)>
<28, (0, 25, 17)>
<23, (4, 0, 0)>
<6, (10, 0, 0)>
<10, (25, 22, 6)>
<18, (27, 17, 12)>
<13, (27, 29, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
