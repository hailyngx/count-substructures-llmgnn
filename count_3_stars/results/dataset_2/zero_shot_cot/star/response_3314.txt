Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 26) (9, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 10) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 21) (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 12) (15, 28) (23, 26) (23, 21) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 25) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 21) (11, 25) (4, 22) (4, 20) (4, 17) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 1) (18, 29) (26, 5) (26, 23) (26, 18) (20, 4) (20, 29) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 18) (29, 20) (29, 16) (29, 10) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 1) (10, 27) (10, 29) (10, 21) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 10) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (22, 25) (12, 15) (12, 2) (12, 22) (12, 24) (12, 28) (7, 17) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 12) (24, 17) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 24) (17, 28) (28, 15) (28, 19) (28, 12) (28, 17) (25, 2) (25, 11) (25, 22) (16, 6) (16, 29) (16, 14) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

- <0, (3, 24, 27)>
- <2, (12, 22, 25)>
- <4, (17, 20, 22)>
- <8, (13, 14, 16)>
- <10, (21, 27, 29)>
- <11, (21, 25, 3)>
- <15, (1, 12, 29)>
- <18, (1, 26, 29)>
- <19, (1, 20, 28)>
- <21, (10, 11, 13)>
- <23, (21, 26, 1)>
- <24, (0, 12, 27)>
- <28, (12, 17, 19)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [13].
