Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 8) (0, 27) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 8) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 21) (20, 18) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 15) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 5) (10, 1) (10, 24) (17, 29) (17, 15) (28, 6) (28, 13) (28, 23) (29, 17) (29, 19) (6, 0) (6, 28) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 19) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 15) (23, 27) (23, 28) (23, 26) (26, 11) (26, 25) (26, 23) (26, 21) (3, 18) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 14) (24, 16) (24, 10) (1, 20) (1, 10) (14, 20) (14, 5) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 18) (8, 21) (19, 25) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 9) (21, 22) (21, 26) (21, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (13, 28) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star.

Let's start by listing the adjacent nodes for each node:
- Node 0: {27, 9, 13, 6}
- Node 1: {20, 10}
- Node 2: {22, 5, 15}
- Node 3: {18}
- Node 4: {11, 7, 19}
- Node 5: {7, 2, 14}
- Node 6: {0, 28}
- Node 7: {4, 19, 5}
- Node 8: {11, 16, 18, 21}
- Node 9: {0, 22, 19}
- Node 10: {1, 24}
- Node 11: {16, 8, 4, 26}
- Node 13: {0, 18, 28}
- Node 14: {20, 5}
- Node 15: {25, 17, 2}
- Node 16: {11, 24, 8}
- Node 17: {29, 15}
- Node 18: {22, 20, 3, 13, 8}
- Node 19: {25, 4, 7, 29, 9}
- Node 20: {18, 25, 1, 14}
- Node 21: {8, 22, 26}
- Node 22: {27, 18, 9, 2, 21}
- Node 23: {27, 28, 26}
- Node 24: {16, 10}
- Node 25: {20, 26, 19, 15}
- Node 26: {11, 25, 23, 21}
- Node 27: {0, 22, 23}
- Node 28: {6, 13, 23}
- Node 29: {17, 19}

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<27, (0, 22, 23)>
<25, (20, 19, 26)>
<22, (27, 18, 9)>
<19, (25, 4, 29)>
<18, (22, 20, 8)>
<16, (11, 24, 8)>
<15, (25, 17, 2)>
<13, (0, 18, 28)>
<11, (16, 8, 4)>
<10, (1, 24, 16)>
<9, (0, 22, 19)>
<8, (16, 11, 18)>
<7, (4, 19, 5)>
<6, (0, 28, 27)>
<5, (7, 2, 14)>
<4, (11, 7, 19)>
<3, (18)>
<2, (22, 5, 15)>
<1, (20, 10, 24)>

Count of 3-stars: [19]
