Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 12) (15, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 16) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 17) (17, 2) (17, 1) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 18) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 0) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 14) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's go step by step:

1. List all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 10.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 17.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 15, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 19, 11.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 0.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 17.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 19, 0.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 13, 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 19, 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 5, 11.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 18, 16.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 13, 16.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 2, 1.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- <2, (6, 8, 17)>
- <8, (4, 2, 10)>
- <11, (3, 15, 9)>
- <5, (13, 19, 11)>
- <13, (5, 10, 0)>
- <1, (4, 7, 17)>
- <16, (7, 19, 0)>
- <10, (8, 13, 18)>
- <18, (10, 19, 14)>
- <14, (6, 5, 11)>
- <12, (3, 8, 19)>
- <19, (5, 18, 16)>
- <0, (5, 13, 16)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get 13. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
