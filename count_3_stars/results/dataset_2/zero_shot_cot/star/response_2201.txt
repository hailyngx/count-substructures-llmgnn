Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the 3-stars and then count the unique ones:

<1, (6, 2, 3)>
<2, (6, 1, 5)>
<3, (9, 1, 4)>
<4, (9, 3, 7)>
<5, (4, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 2, 0)>
<7, (9, 3, 4)>
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
<9, (8, 3, 4)>
<10, (8, 5, 0)>
<11, (5, 4, 8)>
<12, (5, 8, 2)>
<13, (2, 5, 6)>
<14, (2, 6, 1)>
<15, (6, 2, 1)>
<16, (0, 5, 6)>
<17, (0, 6, 1)>
<18, (0, 5, 7)>
<19, (7, 3, 4)>
<20, (7, 4, 9)>
<21, (4, 8, 9)>

There are [21] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
