Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 19) (19, 5) (19, 11) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 18) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 16) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 0) (6, 15) (6, 14) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes can be the central nodes of the 3-stars.
- Node 2 has edges to nodes 15, 4, and 0.
- Node 4 has edges to nodes 15, 5, and 1.
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 9, 19, and 4.
- Node 7 has edges to nodes 17, 11, and 16.
- Node 9 has edges to nodes 5, 8, and 13.
- Node 11 has edges to nodes 10, 7, and 19.
- Node 13 has edges to nodes 9, 14, and 17.
- Node 15 has edges to nodes 3, 6, and 2.
- Node 16 has edges to nodes 5, 17, and 7.
- Node 17 has edges to nodes 14, 13, and 7.

For each of these nodes, we can form a 3-star graph and count the total number of such graphs.

Let's calculate all the 3-stars:

<2, (15, 4, 0)>
<4, (15, 5, 1)>
<5, (9, 19, 4)>
<7, (17, 11, 16)>
<9, (5, 8, 13)>
<11, (10, 7, 19)>
<13, (9, 14, 17)>
<15, (3, 6, 2)>
<16, (5, 17, 7)>
<17, (14, 13, 7)>

The final answer is therefore [10].
