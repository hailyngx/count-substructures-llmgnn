Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 21) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 23) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 16) (13, 25) (13, 4) (13, 1) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 1) (25, 13) (25, 7) (25, 4) (25, 28) (16, 29) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 25) (28, 16) (28, 12) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 22) (9, 8) (9, 15) (18, 26) (18, 14) (18, 10) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 27) (2, 19) (2, 15) (22, 17) (22, 8) (22, 27) (11, 7) (11, 0) (3, 6) (27, 26) (27, 22) (27, 20) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 20) (19, 29) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 12) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 21) (4, 13) (4, 25) (4, 15) (12, 5) (12, 28) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 24) (14, 16) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 14) (20, 27) (20, 24) (20, 21) (21, 5) (21, 15) (21, 20) (10, 18) (10, 24) (23, 6) 

Response:
First, identify all the nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a potential 3-star structure. 

The nodes that fit this criteria are: 
- Node 5 
- Node 6 
- Node 7 
- Node 13 
- Node 16 
- Node 17 
- Node 25 
- Node 26 
- Node 28 

For each of these nodes, check if they are connected to exactly 3 other distinct nodes. 
Count the number of 3-stars accordingly. 

[<5, (0, 12, 21)>, <6, (3, 23, 5)>, <7, (1, 11, 15)>, <13, (1, 4, 25)>, <16, (14, 28, 29)>, <17, (22, 26, 29)>, <25, (4, 7, 28)>, <26, (18, 27, 17)>, <28, (12, 16, 25)>]
