Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 25) (22, 10) (22, 15) (22, 29) (23, 3) (23, 28) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 13) (20, 0) (20, 7) (20, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 27) (2, 14) (18, 9) (18, 14) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 28) (26, 13) (26, 5) (26, 11) (26, 8) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 11) (5, 26) (5, 8) (19, 8) (19, 9) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 29) (29, 1) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 11) (8, 26) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 25) (16, 21) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 27) (6, 1) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 28) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 28) (12, 3) (11, 21) (11, 26) (11, 7) (11, 29) (15, 22) (3, 23) (3, 20) (3, 12) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (25, 21) (25, 8) (4, 17) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 16) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 24) (28, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0: 20, 7, 13
Node 1: 21, 6, 29, 27
Node 2: 10, 17, 27, 14
Node 3: 23, 20, 12
Node 4: 17
Node 5: 26, 8
Node 6: 1, 24
Node 7: 0, 20, 11
Node 8: 26, 5, 19, 25
Node 9: 18, 19, 29
Node 10: 22, 17, 2
Node 11: 21, 26, 7, 29
Node 12: 16, 24, 28, 3
Node 13: 0, 26, 28
Node 14: 2, 18, 16
Node 15: 22
Node 16: 21, 12, 14, 27
Node 17: 10, 2, 4
Node 18: 9, 14
Node 19: 8, 9
Node 20: 0, 7, 3
Node 21: 1, 16, 11, 25
Node 22: 10, 15, 29
Node 23: 3, 28
Node 24: 6, 12, 28
Node 25: 21, 8
Node 26: 13, 5, 11, 8
Node 27: 1, 2, 16
Node 28: 23, 13, 24, 12
Node 29: 1, 22, 9, 11

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[(1)]

<1, (21, 6, 29)>
<21, (1, 16, 11)>
<22, (10, 15, 29)>
<26, (13, 5, 11)>
<29, (1, 22, 9)> 

Count of 3-stars: [5]
