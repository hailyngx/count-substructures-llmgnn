Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each instance of a 3-star. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.
2. For each potential center, check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes and those nodes are not directly connected to each other. This will form a valid 3-star.
3. Keep track of each unique 3-star found.

Let's start by listing the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 14, 10, 11, 5, 1
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 3, 11, 12, 7

Now, we will look at each potential center and check for valid 3-stars:

1. For Node 0:
- <0, (9, 14, 10)> [1]
- <0, (9, 11, 5)> [2]
- <0, (9, 14, 11)> [3]
- <0, (9, 5, 1)> [4]
- <0, (14, 11, 1)> [5]

2. For Node 2:
- <2, (5, 3, 11)> [6]
- <2, (5, 7, 12)> [7]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
