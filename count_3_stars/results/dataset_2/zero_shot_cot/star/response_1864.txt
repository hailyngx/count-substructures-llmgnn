Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 13) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 16) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 15) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 12) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 18) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 0) (6, 12) (6, 14) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (4, 13) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (15, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Starting from node 0: 
- <0, (16, 14, 15)>

2. Moving to node 1: 
- <1, (12, 10, 18)>
- <1, (10, 7, 1)>

3. Moving to node 2: 
- <2, (16, 8, 2)>
- <2, (8, 14, 2)>
- <2, (14, 0, 2)>

4. Moving to node 3: 
- <3, (5, 11, 3)>
- <3, (11, 18, 3)>
- <3, (18, 13, 3)>

5. Moving to node 4: 
- <4, (13, 4, 19)>

6. Moving to node 5: 
- <5, (9, 17, 3)>
- <5, (17, 13, 5)>

7. Moving to node 6: 
- <6, (12, 14, 6)>

8. Moving to node 7: 
- <7, (16, 10, 8)>
- <7, (10, 1, 7)>
- <7, (1, 12, 7)>

9. Moving to node 8: 
- <8, (9, 7, 8)>
- <8, (7, 2, 8)>
- <8, (2, 8, 11)>

10. Moving to node 9: 
- <9, (5, 8, 17)>

11. Moving to node 10: 
- <10, (7, 1, 16)>

12. Moving to node 11: 
- <11, (3, 8, 18)>

13. Moving to node 12: 
- <12, (13, 1, 18)>

14. Moving to node 13: 
- <13, (17, 19, 13)>

15. Moving to node 14: 
- <14, (2, 6, 15)>

16. Moving to node 15: 
- <15, (14, 0, 15)>

17. Moving to node 16: 
- <16, (7, 0, 2)>

18. Moving to node 17: 
- <17, (5, 13, 18)>

19. Moving to node 18: 
- <18, (12, 3, 11)>

20. Moving to node 19: 
- <19, (13, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [20].
