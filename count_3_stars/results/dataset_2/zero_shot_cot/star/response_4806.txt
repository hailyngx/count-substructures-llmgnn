Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
[There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (6, 9, 4)>
<3, (0, 8, 5)>
