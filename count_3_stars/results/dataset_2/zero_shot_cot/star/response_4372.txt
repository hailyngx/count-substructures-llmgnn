Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes can serve as the centers of 3-stars.
2. For each node identified in step 1, check if the 3 neighbors are connected to each other. If they form a 3-star configuration, count it.

Let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (11, 1, 13)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<4, (10, 14, -)>
<7, (6, 2, -)>
<10, (4, 11, 12)>
<11, (9, 10, 3)>
<8, (5, 11, 13)>
<13, (9, 8, 12)>
<1, (9, 6, 2)>
<3, (6, 11, 8)>
<0, (13, 1, 2)>
<14, (4, 10, 11)>
<2, (5, 7, 10)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
