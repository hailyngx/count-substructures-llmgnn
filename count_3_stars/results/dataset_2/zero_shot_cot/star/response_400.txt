Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with degrees 3 are: 2, 8, and 1.

Now, for each of these nodes, let's identify the 3-stars:
- For node 2:
    - (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3) forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center. <2, (5, 1, 3)>

- For node 8:
    - (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 3) forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center. <8, (2, 1, 3)>

- For node 1:
    - (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 9) forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center. <1, (6, 2, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the graph.
