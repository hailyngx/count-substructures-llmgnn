Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 14) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 2) (14, 11) (14, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
1. <5, (4, 6, 9)>
2. <9, (4, 8, 13)>
3. <8, (1, 3, 9)>
4. <13, (0, 4, 9)>
5. <10, (0, 5, 12)>
6. <11, (2, 12, 14)>
7. <6, (3, 5, 13)>
8. <3, (6, 8, 11)>
9. <0, (1, 10, 13)>
10. <7, (0, 3, 6)>
11. <1, (0, 8, 9)>
12. <2, (4, 11, 12)>
13. <12, (0, 2, 10)>
14. <14, (3, 11, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
