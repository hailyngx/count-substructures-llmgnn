Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
We need to find all the 3-stars in this graph. 

Let's start by looking at each node and checking if it is the center of a 3-star. 

- Node 0: (0, 6, 2), (0, 6, 1)
- Node 1: (1, 9, 2), (1, 9, 13)
- Node 2: (2, 1, 0), (2, 1, 4)
- Node 3: No 3-star centered at node 3
- Node 4: (4, 6, 12), (4, 6, 2)
- Node 5: No 3-star centered at node 5
- Node 6: (6, 4, 0), (6, 4, 2)
- Node 7: (7, 8, 1), (7, 8, 12)
- Node 8: (8, 7, 12), (8, 7, 13)
- Node 9: (9, 11, 1)
- Node 10: No 3-star centered at node 10
- Node 11: No 3-star centered at node 11
- Node 12: (12, 7, 8), (12, 7, 4)
- Node 13: (13, 6, 8), (13, 6, 1)
- Node 14: (14, 4, 5), (14, 4, 3)

Therefore, the identified 3-stars are:
<0, 6, 2>, <0, 6, 1>, <1, 9, 2>, <1, 9, 13>, <2, 1, 0>, <2, 1, 4>, <4, 6, 12>, <4, 6, 2>, <7, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 12>, <8, 7, 12>, <8, 7, 13>, <9, 11, 1>, <12, 7, 8>, <12, 7, 4>, <13, 6, 8>, <13, 6, 1>, <14, 4, 5>, <14, 4, 3>

Count of 3-stars found: [18]
