Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 16) (8, 4) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 19) (28, 13) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 1) (26, 19) (26, 17) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 20) (2, 22) (2, 14) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 29) (22, 7) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 29) (0, 23) (16, 4) (16, 14) (6, 18) (24, 5) (24, 13) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 20) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 22) (7, 29) (29, 22) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 11) (25, 9) (13, 28) (13, 24) (23, 0) (23, 1) (23, 20) (1, 19) (1, 23) (17, 26) (17, 11) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 17) (27, 3) (20, 9) (20, 10) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 14) (14, 5) (14, 21) (14, 2) (14, 16) (14, 20) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. We will list these unique 3-stars and count them in the end.

Here are the 3-star patterns found in the graph:

<5, (9, 14, 24)>
<9, (5, 18, 25)>
<15, (3, 4, 19)>
<4, (15, 8, 16)>
<21, (28, 10, 11)>
<28, (21, 0, 19)>
<19, (15, 26, 1)>
<10, (21, 7, 18)>
<22, (2, 29, 7)>
<0, (28, 22, 29)>
<16, (4, 14, 0)>
<13, (24, 28, 0)>
<23, (0, 1, 20)>
<1, (19, 23, 26)>
<17, (26, 11, 5)>
<27, (3, 7, 15)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [16].
