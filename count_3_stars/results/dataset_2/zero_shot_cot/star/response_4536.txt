Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 19) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 16) (3, 9) (3, 15) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 18) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 13) (29, 12) (29, 4) (14, 23) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 16) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 1) (13, 29) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 27) (22, 26) (22, 11) (23, 14) (23, 11) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 11) (20, 10) (21, 8) (21, 0) (21, 24) (24, 21) (24, 4) (24, 5) (4, 29) (4, 14) (4, 24) (4, 27) (27, 13) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 6) (11, 22) (11, 23) (11, 20) (11, 19) (1, 8) (1, 13) (6, 27) (28, 18) (28, 25) (7, 29) (7, 13) (7, 27) (7, 16) (16, 26) (16, 17) (16, 7) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 11) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 15) (18, 28) (18, 10) (18, 5) (25, 8) (25, 28) (12, 29) (12, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 21, 12, 19
Node 1: 8, 13
Node 2: 29, 10
Node 3: 9, 15, 20
Node 4: 29, 14, 24, 27
Node 5: 24, 18
Node 6: 27
Node 7: 29, 13, 27, 16
Node 8: 13, 25, 21, 1
Node 9: 3, 19
Node 10: 26, 2, 14, 20, 18
Node 11: 22, 23, 20, 19
Node 12: 29, 0
Node 13: 29, 8, 1, 7, 27
Node 14: 29, 4, 10
Node 15: 3, 20, 18
Node 16: 26, 17, 7
Node 17: 16
Node 18: 15, 28, 10, 5
Node 19: 9, 0, 11
Node 20: 3, 15, 11, 10
Node 21: 8, 0, 24
Node 22: 26, 11
Node 23: 14, 11
Node 24: 21, 4, 5
Node 25: 8, 28
Node 26: 22, 10, 16
Node 27: 13, 4, 7, 6
Node 28: 18, 25
Node 29: 2, 7, 13, 12, 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (29, 10, 14)>
<2, (29, 10, 18)>
<2, (29, 10, 20)>
<2, (29, 10, 4)>
<4, (14, 29, 4)>
<4, (14, 29, 24)>
<4, (14, 29, 27)>
<7, (29, 13, 27)>
<8, (13, 1, 8)>
<13, (1, 13, 7)>
<13, (1, 13, 27)>
<13, (7, 13, 27)>
<14, (10, 29, 4)>
<15, (3, 20, 15)>
<18, (10, 20, 18)>
<18, (10, 18, 5)>
<18, (15, 18, 28)>
<18, (5, 18, 28)>
<19, (9, 19, 0)>
<20, (10, 20, 11)>
<20, (11, 20, 3)>
<20, (11, 20, 15)>
<20, (20, 3, 15)>
<22, (26, 22, 11)>
