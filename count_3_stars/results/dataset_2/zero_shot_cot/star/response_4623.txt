Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step.

1. Identify nodes with three edges (these nodes can be centers of 3-stars):
- Node 10 is connected to 5, 13, and 16.
- Node 13 is connected to 5, 10, and 11.
- Node 2 is connected to 1, 12, and 14.
- Node 18 is connected to 4, 15, and 19.
- Node 15 is connected to 1, 4, and 18.
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 12, and 13.
- Node 19 is connected to 2, 7, and 11.

2. Build the 3-stars using the identified central nodes and their neighbors:
- <10, (5, 13, 16)>
- <13, (5, 10, 11)>
- <2, (1, 12, 14)>
- <18, (4, 15, 19)>
- <15, (1, 4, 18)>
- <3, (0, 12, 13)>
- <19, (2, 7, 11)>

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
