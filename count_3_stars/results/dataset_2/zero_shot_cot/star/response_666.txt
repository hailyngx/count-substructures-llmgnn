Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its connections:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, and 2.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 8, and 0.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 0, and 3.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 2.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 0, 3, 6.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, 1, 4.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 1, 2.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 8.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 1.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 3, 1.

From the information given, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 1, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 6)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 4, 1)>
<7, (0, 8, 7)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars gives a total of 10 3-stars. 
Therefore, the answer is [10].
