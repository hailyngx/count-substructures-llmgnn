Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 21) (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 12) (6, 11) (23, 22) (23, 25) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 2) (14, 0) (14, 25) (28, 9) (28, 29) (1, 17) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 4) (29, 0) (29, 28) (29, 15) (29, 4) (29, 10) (3, 26) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 16) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 21) (17, 1) (17, 24) (21, 22) (21, 11) (8, 20) (8, 24) (8, 12) (25, 23) (25, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 3) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 2) (24, 17) (24, 8) (24, 19) (2, 0) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 15) (19, 24) (19, 10) (7, 5) (7, 26) (7, 27) (15, 29) (15, 2) (15, 18) (10, 13) (10, 29) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 4) (27, 7) (18, 13) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 15) (4, 0) (4, 26) (4, 29) (4, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 14, 20)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (0, 15, 16)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (10, 11, 16)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 10, 26)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (12, 20, 24)>
6. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (12, 28, 5)>
7. Node 10 forms two 3-stars: <10, (3, 19, 29)> and <10, (4, 10, 13)>
8. Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (3, 21, 6)>
9. Node 12 forms a 3-star: <12, (8, 16, 9)>
10. Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (18, 10, 22)>
11. Node 15 forms a 3-star: <15, (18, 2, 29)>
12. Node 16 forms a 3-star: <16, (2, 12, 18)>
13. Node 18 forms four 3-stars: <18, (13, 15, 20)>, <18, (16, 18, 12)>, <18, (18, 15, 18)>, <18, (4, 10, 13)>
14. Node 20 forms a 3-star: <20, (18, 0, 8)>
15. Node 22 forms a 3-star: <22, (21, 23, 13)>
16. Node 24 forms a 3-star: <24, (19, 8, 24)>
17. Node 26 forms a 3-star: <26, (4, 27, 3)>
18. Node 29 forms two 3-stars: <29, (4, 15, 29)> and <29, (10, 28, 29)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in brackets:
