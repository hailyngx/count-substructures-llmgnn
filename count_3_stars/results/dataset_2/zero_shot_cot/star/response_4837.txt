Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 18) (6, 24) (9, 14) (9, 13) (2, 5) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 28) (29, 17) (29, 11) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 5) (20, 0) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 26) (18, 15) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 21) (22, 4) (22, 26) (22, 1) (26, 2) (26, 4) (26, 22) (26, 13) (26, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 26) (13, 10) (13, 27) (27, 3) (27, 4) (27, 13) (28, 2) (28, 10) (21, 3) (21, 0) (21, 17) (21, 19) (21, 25) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 23) (11, 1) (23, 17) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 12) (8, 19) (8, 12) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 1) (7, 23) (7, 19) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 21) (25, 7) (24, 6) (24, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 17) (1, 2) (1, 22) (1, 11) (1, 19) (1, 24) (14, 9) (14, 7) (10, 13) (10, 28) (12, 23) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph. We know that a 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the list of edges and identify the 3-stars one by one: 

1. <3, (15, 21, 27)>
2. <15, (3, 0, 18)>
3. <21, (3, 17, 19)>
4. <27, (3, 4, 13)>
5. <13, (3, 9, 26)>
6. <0, (15, 20, 5)>
7. <5, (2, 0, 17)>
8. <17, (29, 21, 19)>
9. <29, (17, 11, 0)>
10. <4, (27, 22, 26)>
11. <18, (15, 17, 5)>
12. <22, (4, 26, 1)>
13. <26, (2, 4, 13)>
14. <2, (5, 26, 1)>
15. <20, (0)>
16. <9, (14, 13)>
17. <14, (9, 7)>
18. <6, (24)>
19. <29, (17, 11, 0)>
20. <11, (29, 26, 23)>
21. <23, (17, 11, 7)>
22. <8, (19, 12)>
23. <19, (17, 21, 8)>
24. <7, (23, 19, 25)>
25. <25, (21, 7)>
26. <24, (6, 1)>
27. <10, (13, 28)>
28. <12, (23, 8)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars found in the graph: [28]
