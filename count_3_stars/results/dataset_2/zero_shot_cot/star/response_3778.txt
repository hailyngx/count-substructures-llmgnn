Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (6, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (18, 10) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 19) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 12) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 7) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 13) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 16) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 18) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 19) (17, 2) (17, 0) (14, 7) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of times each node appears as a central node in a 3-star.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars with each node as the center:
- Node 11: (1, 3, 8)
- Node 16: (1, 12, 13)
- Node 5: (4, 10, 15)
- Node 12: (5, 13, 15)
- Node 10: (6, 5, 18)
- Node 4: (3, 5, 4)
- Node 18: (5, 10, 10)
- Node 2: (7, 8, 17)
- Node 8: (2, 11, 11)
- Node 3: (0, 4, 19)
- Node 15: (5, 9, 12)
- Node 1: (7, 11, 16)
- Node 7: (1, 2, 14)
- Node 9: (0, 15, 19)
- Node 13: (0, 12, 16)
- Node 6: (6, 10, 10)
- Node 0: (11, 13, 19)
- Node 17: (0, 2, 17)
- Node 14: (1, 7, 7)
- Node 19: (0, 9, 0)

Counting the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 11: 3
- Node 16: 3
- Node 5: 1
- Node 12: 1
- Node 10: 1
- Node 4: 1
- Node 18: 1
- Node 2: 1
- Node 8: 2
- Node 3: 1
- Node 15: 1
- Node 1: 1
- Node 7: 1
- Node 9: 1
- Node 13: 1
- Node 6: 1
- Node 0: 2
- Node 17: 1
- Node 14: 1
- Node 19: 2

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is:
[18]

<13, (0, 12, 16)>
<6, (6, 10, 10)>
<0, (11, 13, 19)>
<17, (0, 2, 17)>
<14, (1, 7, 7)>
