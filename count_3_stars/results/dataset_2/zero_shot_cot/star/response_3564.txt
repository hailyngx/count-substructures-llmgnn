Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 4) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 14, 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 10.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 12, 1, 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 3, 10, 13, 11.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 12, 1, 10, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 0, 14, 13, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 14, 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 2, 11, 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, 1, 6, 4, 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 4.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 0, 6.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 3, 10, 4.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 0, 8, 10.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

[Total number of 3-stars: 6]
<0, (7, 12, 14)>
<2, (9, 5, 11)>
<4, (6, 1, 10)>
<7, (12, 0, 14)>
<9, (5, 2, 9)>
<13, (0, 7, 13)>
