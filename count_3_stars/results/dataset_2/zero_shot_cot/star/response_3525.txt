Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 10) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step. 

Step 1: Identify all nodes with exactly 3 adjacent edges.
- Node 5 has 4 adjacent edges: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 4)
- Node 9 has 4 adjacent edges: (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 12)
- Node 10 has 4 adjacent edges: (10, 3), (10, 6), (10, 12), (10, 4)
- Node 2 has 4 adjacent edges: (2, 5), (2, 11), (2, 14), (2, 4)
- Node 8 has 5 adjacent edges: (8, 11), (8, 7), (8, 14), (8, 3), (8, 1)
- Node 6 has 5 adjacent edges: (6, 5), (6, 10), (6, 7), (6, 0), (6, 13)
- Node 0 has 4 adjacent edges: (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 14), (0, 1)
- Node 14 has 5 adjacent edges: (14, 11), (14, 2), (14, 8), (14, 0), (14, 13)
- Node 3 has 4 adjacent edges: (3, 10), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 4)
- Node 1 has 4 adjacent edges: (1, 9), (1, 12), (1, 8), (1, 0)

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars based on the information above.

- Possible 3-stars involving Node 5: <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <5, (9, 4, 2)>
- Possible 3-stars involving Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 12)>, <9, (5, 1, 12)>
- Possible 3-stars involving Node 10: None
- Possible 3-stars involving Node 2: None
- Possible 3-stars involving Node 8: <8, (11, 7, 1)>, <8, (11, 7, 14)>, <8, (11, 3, 1)>, <8, (11, 3, 14)>, <8, (7, 3, 1)>, <8, (7, 3, 14)>
- Possible 3-stars involving Node 6: None
- Possible 3-stars involving Node 0: None
- Possible 3-stars involving Node 14: None
- Possible 3-stars involving Node 3: None
- Possible 3-stars involving Node 1: None

Based on the possible 3-stars identified above, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [2]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
