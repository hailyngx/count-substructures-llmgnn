Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 20) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (14, 17) (14, 20) (14, 15) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 27) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 26) (27, 5) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 25) (20, 13) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 12) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 29) (28, 17) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (21, 6) (21, 24) (13, 20) (13, 29) (13, 12) (13, 16) (26, 27) (26, 15) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 22) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 26) (11, 8) (11, 12) (23, 24) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 3) (5, 27) (5, 29) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 4) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 19) (12, 25) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 24) (24, 21) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 9) (1, 24) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 16) (22, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the list of edges and identify the unique 3-stars:

<6, (21, 20, 0)>
<9, (3, 1, 19)>
<14, (17, 20, 15)>
<27, (0, 26, 5)>
<25, (20, 7, 19)>
<10, (14, 17, 15)>
<18, (2, 15, 29)>
<28, (17, 29, 2)>
<13, (20, 29, 12)>
<2, (10, 18, 7)>
<8, (11, 19, 16)>
<16, (13, 8, 4)>
<12, (25, 13, 11)>
<24, (21, 23, 1)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars we found:
