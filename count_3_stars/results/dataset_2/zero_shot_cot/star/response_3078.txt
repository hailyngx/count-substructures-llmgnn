Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 0) (7, 9) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 15) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 5) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (19, 6) (19, 8) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaf nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
1. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
2. <2, (0, 15, 18)>
3. <3, (1, 13, 17)>
4. <4, (1, 8, 12)>
5. <5, (1, 13, 17)>
6. <6, (9, 11, 19)>
7. <7, (0, 9, 0)>
8. <8, (0, 4, 8)>
9. <9, (6, 12, 18)>
10. <10, (11, 12, 13)>
11. <11, (6, 10, 18)>
12. <12, (4, 10, 9)>
13. <13, (1, 3, 10)>
14. <14, (0, 16, 0)>
15. <15, (2, 18, 0)>
16. <16, (14, 17, 9)>
17. <17, (3, 5, 16)>
18. <18, (9, 11, 15)>
19. <19, (6, 8, 19)>

Since each 3-star is unique, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
