Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 12) (12, 17) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 1) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (16, 4) (16, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- 3 is connected to 15, 2, and itself. <3, (15, 2, 3)>
- 15 is connected to 3, 0, and 19. <15, (3, 0, 19)>
- 4 is connected to 10, 16, and itself. <4, (10, 16, 4)>
- 7 is connected to 6, 19, and 14. <7, (6, 19, 14)>
- 8 is connected to 13, 14, and 17. <8, (13, 14, 17)>
- 13 is connected to 8, 19, and 9. <13, (8, 19, 9)>
- 18 is connected to 17, 1, and itself. <18, (17, 1, 18)>
- 5 is connected to 19, 1, and 17. <5, (19, 1, 17)>
- 11 is connected to 14, 0, and 2. <11, (14, 0, 2)>
- 6 is connected to 7, 17, and 16. <6, (7, 17, 16)>
- 12 is connected to 17, 9, and itself. <12, (17, 9, 12)>
- 10 is connected to 4, 14, and 1. <10, (4, 14, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
