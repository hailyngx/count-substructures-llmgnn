Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 0: (0, 2, 4), (0, 5, 7), (0, 4, 7), (0, 5, 7) 
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 8), (1, 4, 7), (1, 7, 9)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 6), (2, 0, 8)
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 9), (3, 5, 7), (3, 8, 9)
5. Node 4: (4, 0, 7), (4, 1, 7), (4, 7, 9)
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 7), (5, 3, 7)
7. Node 6: (6, 2, 3)
8. Node 7: (7, 0, 4), (7, 1, 4), (7, 4, 9), (7, 5, 3), (7, 8, 9)
9. Node 8: (8, 1, 3), (8, 2, 0), (8, 3, 9), (8, 7, 9)
10. Node 9: (9, 0, 1), (9, 1, 7), (9, 3, 8), (9, 7, 4)

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 0)>, <1, (3, 8, 1)>, <1, (4, 7, 1)>, <1, (7, 9, 1)>, <2, (0, 6, 2)>, <2, (0, 8, 2)>, <3, (1, 9, 3)>, <3, (5, 7, 3)>, <3, (8, 9, 3)>, <4, (0, 7, 4)>, <4, (1, 7, 4)>, <4, (7, 9, 4)>, <5, (0, 7, 5)>, <5, (3, 7, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (4, 9, 7)>, <7, (5, 3, 7)>, <7, (8, 9, 7)>, <8, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 0, 8)>, <8, (3, 9, 8)>, <8, (7, 9, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 4, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 29.
