Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 14) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the possible 3-stars, represented as <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)>:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (12, 13, 7)>
<3, (9, 13, 14)>
<4, (6, 10, 13)>
<6, (4, 13, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 10)>
<8, (0, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 10)>
<10, (0, 5, 9)>
<11, (1, 7, 12)>
<12, (2, 11, 13)>
<13, (2, 3, 12)>
<14, (3, 7, 14)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
