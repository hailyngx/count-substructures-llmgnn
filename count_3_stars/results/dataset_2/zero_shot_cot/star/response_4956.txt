Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 19) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 17) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 2) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 17) (10, 13) (10, 3) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 19) (14, 15) (14, 19) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars in the graph. Here are the unique 3-stars listed:

<2, (8, 12, 6)>
<3, (4, 10, 19)>
<4, (7, 5, 3)>
<5, (4, 18, 11)>
<6, (2, 12, 16)>
<7, (4, 11, 19)>
<8, (13, 2, 9)>
<9, (8, 1, 17)>
<10, (13, 3, 10)>
<11, (7, 18, 0)>
<12, (13, 16, 17)>
<13, (8, 12, 10)>
<14, (15, 19, 14)>
<15, (19, 14, 15)>
<16, (1, 12, 0)>
<17, (9, 1, 0)>
<18, (8, 11, 5)>
<19, (7, 15, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
