Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars in the graph. Since a 3-star has a center node that is connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges.

Here are the nodes with three edges:
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 0), (3, 6)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 7)

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (5, 4, 8)>
<3, (5, 0, 6)>
<6, (5, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
