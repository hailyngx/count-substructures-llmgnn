Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 27) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (20, 2) (25, 6) (25, 24) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 21) (8, 7) (5, 12) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 15) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 13) (29, 20) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 12) (2, 20) (2, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 17) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 23) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 27) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 17) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 12) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 15) (24, 25) (24, 6) (24, 9) (14, 6) (22, 20) (22, 0) (22, 27) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 10) (9, 23) (23, 0) (23, 9) (23, 19) (27, 16) (27, 2) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 13) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 21) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (18, 20) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 10) (13, 28) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 18) 

Response:
The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph can be found by looking for nodes that have 3 edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's count them step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify nodes with 3 edges connected.
- Node 6 has 3 edges: (25, 6), (6, 24), (6, 14).
- Node 8 has 3 edges: (4, 8), (8, 21), (8, 7).
- Node 9 has 3 edges: (4, 9), (9, 24), (9, 10).
- Node 10 has 3 edges: (9, 10), (10, 3), (10, 18).
- Node 12 has 3 edges: (5, 12), (15, 12), (12, 21).
- Node 16 has 3 edges: (11, 16), (16, 7), (16, 27).
- Node 17 has 3 edges: (11, 17), (17, 26), (17, 15).
- Node 20 has 3 edges: (20, 29), (2, 20), (20, 18).
- Node 21 has 3 edges: (8, 21), (21, 19), (21, 12).
- Node 22 has 3 edges: (20, 22), (22, 0), (22, 27).
- Node 27 has 3 edges: (2, 27), (27, 22), (27, 13).
- Node 28 has 3 edges: (28, 29), (28, 26), (28, 13).
- Node 29 has 3 edges: (29, 12), (29, 26), (29, 20).

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars.
- There are 12 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Step 3: List the unique 3-stars.
- <6, (25, 24, 14)>
- <8, (4, 21, 7)>
- <9, (4, 24, 10)>
- <10, (9, 3, 18)>
- <12, (5, 15, 21)>
- <16, (11, 7, 27)>
- <17, (11, 26, 15)>
- <20, (29, 2, 18)>
- <21, (8, 19, 12)>
- <22, (20, 0, 27)>
- <27, (2, 22, 13)>
- <28, (29, 26, 13)>
