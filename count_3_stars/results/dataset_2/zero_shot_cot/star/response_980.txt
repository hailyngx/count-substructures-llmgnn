Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 22) (3, 25) (3, 27) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 15) (25, 21) (20, 25) (20, 23) (0, 21) (0, 15) (0, 11) (4, 12) (4, 26) (4, 2) (18, 19) (18, 8) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 1) (28, 7) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 16) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 6) (24, 26) (24, 5) (24, 29) (1, 17) (1, 28) (1, 8) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 22) (5, 26) (5, 24) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 4) (23, 20) (23, 26) (23, 13) (23, 27) (16, 6) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 9) (7, 28) (7, 11) (11, 0) (11, 7) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 10) (21, 25) (21, 0) (21, 15) (21, 29) (15, 25) (15, 0) (15, 21) (15, 29) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 27) (10, 5) (10, 8) (22, 17) (22, 12) (27, 3) (27, 23) (27, 9) (13, 23) (29, 24) (29, 21) (29, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 28, and 8.
   - Node 3, node 16, and node 26 have 4 connections each, so they do not form 3-stars.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - There are 3 instances of 3-stars in the given graph.

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
   - <1, (17, 28, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
