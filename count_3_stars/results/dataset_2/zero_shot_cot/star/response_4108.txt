Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (6, 16) (6, 8) (10, 11) (2, 5) (2, 8) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 13) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 18) (13, 7) (15, 8) (15, 7) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 13) (7, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (3, 0) (3, 12) (19, 9) (19, 0) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <2, (5, 8, 13)>
2. <4, (11, 14, 18)>
3. <5, (2, 9, 13)>
4. <8, (6, 15, 16)>
5. <9, (5, 18, 19)>
6. <11, (4, 14, 18)>
7. <12, (1, 3, 17)>
8. <13, (5, 7, 18)>
9. <14, (1, 11, 18)>
10. <15, (7, 8, 16)>
11. <16, (0, 6, 8)>
12. <17, (0, 4, 12)>
13. <18, (4, 9, 13)>
14. <19, (0, 9, 19)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in total. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
