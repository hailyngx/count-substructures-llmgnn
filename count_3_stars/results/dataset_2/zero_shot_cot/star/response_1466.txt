Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 5) (10, 15) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 7) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 12) (12, 3) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 16) (7, 11) (7, 9) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<3, (15, 11, 0)>
<18, (2, 12, 1)>
<4, (17, 12, 9)>
<1, (2, 18, 0)>
<5, (4, 19, 11)>
<12, (18, 4, 13)>
<16, (10, 8, 0)>

Now count the total number of 3-stars: [7].
