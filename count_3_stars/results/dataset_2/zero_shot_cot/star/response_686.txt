Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 1) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 25) (22, 23) (22, 16) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 28) (17, 22) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 24) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 4) (29, 24) (13, 17) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 28) (26, 13) (26, 18) (3, 19) (3, 8) (11, 1) (11, 19) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 25) (18, 26) (18, 8) (16, 21) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 0) (16, 27) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 0) (4, 29) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 1) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 2) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 25) (2, 12) (2, 19) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 20) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 14) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 4) (15, 14) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 29) (25, 21) (25, 5) (25, 0) (27, 17) (27, 16) (20, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 16
- Node 29

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<16, (21, 22, 27)>
<16, (21, 22, 28)>
<16, (21, 27, 28)>
<16, (22, 27, 28)>
<16, (22, 16, 28)>
<16, (27, 16, 28)>
<29, (17, 24, 4)>
<29, (17, 24, 5)>
<29, (17, 24, 29)>
<29, (17, 5, 29)>
<29, (24, 5, 29)>

So, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
