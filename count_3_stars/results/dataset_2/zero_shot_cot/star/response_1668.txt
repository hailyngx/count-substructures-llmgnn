Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
There are <6, (9, 7, 2)>, <9, (1, 6, 0)>, <1, (9, 3, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, *)>, <4, (6, 8, 5)>, <8, (6, 1, 4)>, <2, (6, 1, 0)>, <0, (9, 2, *)>, and <7, (6, 9, 5)> 3-stars in this graph.
Thus, there are [9] 3-stars in total.
