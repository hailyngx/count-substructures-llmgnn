Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 13) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 12) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 4) (2, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 0) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 19) (15, 12) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (18, 7) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 16) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 3) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 7, and 4. <11, (16, 7, 4)>
2. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 7, and 3. <16, (11, 7, 3)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 14, and 10. <6, (9, 14, 10)>
4. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 17, and 12. <14, (6, 17, 12)>
5. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 1, and 12. <17, (14, 1, 12)>
6. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 15, and 4. <10, (6, 15, 4)>
7. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 15, and 7. <5, (16, 15, 7)>
8. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 0, and 4. <13, (9, 0, 4)>
9. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 0, and an additional node (not in the given edge list).
10. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 17, and 15.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
