Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 6:
   - (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0)
   <6, (9, 5, 1)>, <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>

2. Node 9:
   - (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0)
   <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 0)>

3. Node 4:
   - (4, 9), (4, 5), (4, 1)
   <4, (9, 5, 1)>

4. Node 8:
   - (8, 2), (8, 7)
   No 3-stars centered at node 8.

5. Node 5:
   - (5, 6), (5, 4), (5, 1), (5, 3)
   <5, (6, 4, 1)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>

6. Node 2:
   - (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 3), (2, 0)
   <2, (6, 8, 3)>, <2, (6, 3, 0)>

7. Node 0:
   - (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 2), (0, 7)
   <0, (6, 9, 2)>, <0, (6, 2, 7)>, <0, (9, 2, 7)>

8. Node 7:
   - (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 1)
   <7, (9, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 0, 1)>, <7, (8, 0, 1)>

9. Node 1:
   - (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 7)
   No 3-stars centered at node 1.

10. Node 3:
   - (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 2)
   No 3-stars centered at node 3.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 5, 1)>, <6, (9, 1, 3)>, <6, (9, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 4, 1)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 1, 0)>, <4, (9, 5, 1)>, <5, (6, 4, 1)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <2, (6, 8, 3)>, <2, (6, 3, 0)>, <0, (6, 9, 2)>, <0, (6, 2, 7)>, <0, (9, 2, 7)>, <7, (9, 8, 0)>, <7, (9, 0, 1)>, <7, (8, 0, 1)>.
