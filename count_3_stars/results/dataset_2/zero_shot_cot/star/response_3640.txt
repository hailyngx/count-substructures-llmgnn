Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique sets of nodes that form 3-stars.

Let's start by examining each node in the graph to see if it is the central node of a 3-star. A 3-star has the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

- Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 8, 6, 1 -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 2, 0 -> Central node of a 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 2)>
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 1 -> Central node of a 3-star: <2, (5, 9, 4)>
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 4, 8 -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 8, 0, 3, 1, 2 -> Central node of a 3-star: <4, (8, 0, 3)>
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, 8, 1 -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 5, 0 -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 2, 1 -> Not a central node of a 3-star
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 5, 4, 0, 3 -> Central node of a 3-star: <8, (5, 4, 0)>
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 2, 1, 0 -> Not a central node of a 3-star

Based on the analysis above, we have found the following 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 9, 2)>
- <2, (5, 9, 4)>
- <4, (8, 0, 3)>
- <8, (5, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
