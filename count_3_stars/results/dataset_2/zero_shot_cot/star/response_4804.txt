Let's first identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. 
- Node 13 is connected to 4 other nodes: 22, 26, 1, and 14.
- Node 22 is connected to 3 other nodes: 13, 10, and 24.
- Node 5 is connected to 2 other nodes: 9 and 28.
- Node 9 is connected to 4 other nodes: 5, 6, 18, and 23.
- Node 15 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 17, and 16.
- Node 27 is connected to 1.
- Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes: 9, 2, 18, and 12.
- Node 14 is connected to 2 other nodes: 13 and 17.
- Node 17 is connected to 4 other nodes: 15, 14, 20, and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes: 13, 27, and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes: 1, 11, 0, and 29.
- Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes: 8, 19, 25, and 21.
- Node 8 is connected to 2 other nodes: 4 and 0.
- Node 21 is connected to 3 other nodes: 4, 28, and 25.
- Node 28 is connected to 4 other nodes: 5, 21, 16, and 7.
- Node 19 is connected to 3 other nodes: 4, 26, and 29.
- Node 26 is connected to 4 other nodes: 13, 19, 10, and 11.
- Node 11 is connected to 3 other nodes: 17, 3, and 29.
- Node 16 is connected to 4 other nodes: 15, 28, 12, and 24.
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: 15, 3, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to 1 other node: 28.
- Node 12 is connected to 3 other nodes: 6, 16, and 29.
- Node 18 is connected to 3 other nodes: 9, 6, and 10.
- Node 10 is connected to 3 other nodes: 22, 26, and 18.
- Node 23 is connected to 3 other nodes: 9, 2, and 29.
- Node 24 is connected to 2 other nodes: 22 and 16.
- Node 29 is connected to 5 other nodes: 3, 19, 11, 12, and 23.
- Node 25 is connected to 2 other nodes: 4 and 21.
- Node 2 is connected to 2 other nodes: 6 and 23.

Now let's identify the 3-stars in the graph by finding central nodes with exactly 3 leaf nodes connected to them:
- <13, (22, 26, 1)> 
- <22, (13, 10, 24)> 
- <6, (9, 2, 18)> 
- <9, (5, 6, 18)> 
- <17, (15, 14, 20)> 
- <28, (5, 21, 16)> 
- <4, (8, 19, 25)> 
- <26, (19, 10, 11)> 
- <16, (15, 12, 24)> 
- <3, (1, 0, 29)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
