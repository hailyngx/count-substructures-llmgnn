Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should first identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify all the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (11, 14, 1)>
2. <1, (13, 7, 14)>
3. <2, (9, 11, 12)>
4. <3, (7, 5, 8)>
5. <4, (6, 12, 14)>
6. <5, (6, 8, 10)>
7. <6, (5, 9, 10)>
8. <7, (1, 3, 2)>
9. <8, (3, 5, 14)>
10. <9, (6, 13, 10)>
11. <10, (5, 6, 14)>
12. <11, (0, 2, 9)>
13. <12, (2, 4, 7)>
14. <13, (1, 2, 9)>
15. <14, (0, 1, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique 3-stars identified above. 
Thus, the final answer is [15].
