Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<5, (9, 4, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<3, (5, 1, 6)>
