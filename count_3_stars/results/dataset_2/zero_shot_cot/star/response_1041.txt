Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 12) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 10) (2, 29) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 0) (3, 25) (3, 13) (3, 12) (25, 2) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 8) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 15) (18, 6) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 21) (8, 25) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (7, 25) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 15) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 21) (6, 18) (6, 1) (21, 4) (21, 26) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 20) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 28) (17, 0) (19, 4) (19, 8) (27, 25) (27, 1) (1, 6) (1, 27) (1, 28) (14, 15) (10, 16) (10, 4) (10, 26) (10, 28) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 9) (5, 20) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 14) (28, 2) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 10) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 5) (24, 22) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-star structures. 

The nodes with three connections are:
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 9, 20, 28)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 8, 19, 21)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 9, 17, 25)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 16, 26, 28)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 3, 11, 15)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 3, 17, 18)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 12, 14, 23)
- Node 16 (connected to nodes 10, 17, 7)
- Node 17 (connected to nodes 0, 13, 7)
- Node 19 (connected to nodes 4, 8, 27)
- Node 20 (connected to nodes 2, 5, 13)
- Node 22 (connected to nodes 23, 24, 26)
- Node 25 (connected to nodes 2, 3, 8)
- Node 26 (connected to nodes 10, 21, 22)
- Node 28 (connected to nodes 1, 2, 10)
- Node 29 (connected to nodes 0, 2)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
- <2, (9, 20, 28)>
- <4, (8, 19, 21)>
- <7, (9, 17, 25)>
- <10, (16, 26, 28)>
- <12, (3, 11, 15)>
- <13, (3, 17, 18)>
- <15, (12, 14, 23)>
- <16, (10, 17, 7)>
- <17, (0, 13, 7)>
- <19, (4, 8, 27)>
- <20, (2, 5, 13)>
- <22, (23, 24, 26)>
- <25, (2, 3, 8)>
- <26, (10, 21, 22)>
- <28, (1, 2, 10)>
- <29, (0, 2)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
