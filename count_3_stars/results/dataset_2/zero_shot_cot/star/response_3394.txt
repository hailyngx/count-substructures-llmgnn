Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 9, 5, 3, and 8. It forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 5, 3)>.

2. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 6, 4, 3, and 1. It forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 3)>.

3. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 9, 8, 5, and 1. It forms a 3-star: <4, (9, 8, 5)>.

4. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 6, 4, and 3. It does not form a 3-star.

5. Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 6, 4, and 1. It does not form a 3-star.

6. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 2, and 1. It does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 0, 1, and 3. It forms a 3-star: <2, (4, 0, 1)>.

8. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 6, 9, 8, and 2. It forms a 3-star: <3, (6, 9, 2)>.

From the identified 3-stars, we have <6, (9, 5, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 3)>, <4, (9, 8, 5)>, and <3, (6, 9, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
