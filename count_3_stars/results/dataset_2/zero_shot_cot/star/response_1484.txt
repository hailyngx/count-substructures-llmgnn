Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 8) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 14) (4, 9) (13, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: {2, 5, 7, 17}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 11}
- Node 2: {0, 8, 12, 15}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 8, 10, 18}
- Node 4: {9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 15, 16}
- Node 6: {1, 7, 9, 12}
- Node 7: {0, 6, 11}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 10, 12}
- Node 9: {4, 6, 15}
- Node 10: {3, 8, 15}
- Node 11: {1, 7, 13}
- Node 12: {2, 6, 8, 17}
- Node 13: {11}
- Node 14: {18, 19}
- Node 15: {2, 5, 9, 10}
- Node 16: {5}
- Node 17: {0, 12, 18}
- Node 18: {3, 14, 17}
- Node 19: {14}

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:
- <0, (2, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 11)>
- <2, (0, 8, 12)>
- <3, (1, 5, 18)>
- <5, (0, 3, 15)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 6, 11)>
- <8, (2, 3, 10)>
- <9, (4, 6, 15)>
- <10, (3, 8, 15)>
- <11, (1, 7, 13)>
- <12, (2, 6, 8)>
- <15, (2, 5, 9)>
- <16, (5)>

Count of 3-star structures: [14]
