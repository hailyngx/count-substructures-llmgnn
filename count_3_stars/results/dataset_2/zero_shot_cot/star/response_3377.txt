Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 4) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 13) (21, 7) (21, 17) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 3) (5, 20) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (7, 21) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 27) (6, 28) (6, 19) (6, 4) (28, 6) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 18) (19, 6) (19, 26) (19, 12) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (17, 1) (17, 21) (17, 2) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 27) (3, 5) (25, 5) (25, 22) (25, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 17) (20, 5) (20, 8) (20, 14) (15, 11) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 14) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (29, 16) (29, 24) (18, 28) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 10) (27, 23) (27, 8) (27, 18) (27, 13) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 12) (10, 13) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 10) (14, 25) (14, 20) (14, 15) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 10) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

To form a 3-star, we need a central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <2, (1, 17, 26)>
2. <4, (16, 6, 0)>
3. <5, (9, 24, 25)>
4. <6, (28, 19, 4)>
5. <8, (9, 26, 20)>
6. <10, (9, 12, 13)>
7. <11, (16, 15, 29)>
8. <15, (22, 23, 14)>
9. <17, (1, 21, 2)>
10. <18, (28, 8, 27)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
