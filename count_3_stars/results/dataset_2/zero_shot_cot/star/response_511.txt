Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 13) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 10) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all sets of vertices that form 3-star structures.

There are several 3-star structures in this graph:

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 14, 3)>
<4, (7, 14, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 12)>
<1, (9, 2, 3)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<6, (5, 4, 13)>
<12, (7, 2, 10)>
<0, (9, 1, 3)>
<14, (9, 4, 10)>
<2, (5, 1, 6)>
<11, (13, 8)>
<8, (5, 1, 3)>
<13, (6, 2, 11)>
<10, (12, 14, 8)>

Hence, there are a total of [15] unique 3-stars in the graph.
