Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's do this step by step:

1. The central nodes in each potential 3-star will be the nodes with degree 3. We will start by finding all nodes with degree 3.

Nodes with degree 3 are: 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, 2, and 0.

2. For each central node found in step 1, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star. 

Based on the provided edges, the 3-stars in the graph are:

<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (6, 0, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 3, 8)>
<8, (9, 1, 7)>
<2, (6, 3, 0)>
<0, (6, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
