Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 4, 7, 6, 5, 1, 0, 14, and 12.

We will now count the number of 3-stars in the graph: 

1. For node 4:
<4, (7, 11, 3)> 

2. For node 7:
<7, (4, 10, 8)>

3. For node 6:
<6, (1, 10, 12)>

4. For node 5:
<5, (8, 13, 3)>

5. For node 1:
<1, (6, 8, 5)>

6. For node 0:
<0, (6, 10, 5)>

7. For node 14:
<14, (4, 11, 12)>

8. For node 12:
<12, (6, 2, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
