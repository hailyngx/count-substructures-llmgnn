Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 11) (4, 8) (4, 20) (7, 3) (7, 5) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 22) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 5) (25, 16) (21, 16) (8, 4) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 2) (23, 1) (5, 7) (5, 25) (5, 29) (6, 24) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (1, 23) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 11) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 19) (11, 27) (11, 26) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 24) (28, 10) (16, 25) (16, 21) (16, 17) (24, 6) (24, 28) (24, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 19) (22, 27) (22, 3) (22, 14) (22, 29) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 17) (20, 4) (20, 9) (20, 12) (12, 14) (12, 20) (10, 28) (2, 23) (2, 11) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 24) (29, 5) (29, 22) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 15, 8, 6, 14
- Node 1 has neighbors: 23, 26
- Node 2 has neighbors: 23, 11, 17
- Node 3 has neighbors: 7, 25, 22, 18
- Node 5 has neighbors: 7, 25, 29
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 23, 28, 0
- Node 9 has neighbors: 25, 20, 19
- Node 11 has neighbors: 27, 26, 2
- Node 14 has neighbors: 26, 0, 22, 19, 12
- Node 15 has neighbors: 27, 0, 13
- Node 16 has neighbors: 25, 21, 17
- Node 17 has neighbors: 6, 16, 2, 18
- Node 19 has neighbors: 6, 14, 9
- Node 22 has neighbors: 27, 3, 14, 29
- Node 23 has neighbors: 8, 18, 2, 1
- Node 25 has neighbors: 3, 9, 16, 5
- Node 26 has neighbors: 1, 14, 11
- Node 27 has neighbors: 15, 22, 11
- Node 28 has neighbors: 8, 24, 10

2. Identify all 3-star patterns:
- <0, (15, 8, 6)>
- <0, (15, 8, 14)>
- <0, (15, 6, 14)>
- <0, (8, 6, 14)>
- <3, (7, 25, 22)>
- <14, (26, 0, 22)>
- <17, (6, 16, 2)>
- <19, (6, 14, 9)>
- <22, (27, 3, 29)>

After listing the unique 3-star patterns, we count a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
