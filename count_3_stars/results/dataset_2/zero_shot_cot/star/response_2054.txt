Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) 

Response:
Let's first find the nodes that are connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 1, and 0.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Possible 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (2, 8, 1)> (1)
- Possible 3-star centered at node 9: <9, (4, 3, 1)> (2)
- Possible 3-star centered at node 4: <4, (9, 7, 1)> (3)
- Possible 3-star centered at node 7: <7, (4, 0, 1)> (4)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
