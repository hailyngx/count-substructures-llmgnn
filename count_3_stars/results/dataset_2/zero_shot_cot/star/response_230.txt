Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step.

Step 1: Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
Based on the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 0 (connected to 1, 5, 6)
- Node 2 (connected to 1, 4, 6)
- Node 7 (connected to 5, 8, 10)
- Node 11 (connected to 2, 8, 13)
- Node 12 (connected to 0, 1, 9)
- Node 13 (connected to 1, 3, 11)
- Node 14 (connected to 2, 9, 10)

Step 2: Count the number of unique 3-stars involving the identified nodes.
Now, let's find the unique 3-stars involving the identified nodes:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<7, (5, 8, 10)>
<11, (2, 8, 13)>
<12, (0, 1, 9)>
<13, (1, 3, 11)>
<14, (2, 9, 10)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
The total number of unique 3-stars is [7].

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [7].
