Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<7, (4, 6, 3)>
<1, (4, 3, 2)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 8)>
<8, (7, 1, 6)>
<9, (1, 3, 0)>
<0, (4, 3, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
