Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 18) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 4) (8, 17) (8, 13) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (10, 14) (10, 17) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 16) (11, 5) (15, 9) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 12) (7, 14) (7, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that have exactly three edges are:
- Node 1 (edges: (1, 6), (1, 19), (1, 18))
- Node 12 (edges: (12, 13), (12, 2), (12, 16))
- Node 15 (edges: (15, 9), (15, 16), (15, 16))
- Node 18 (edges: (18, 17), (18, 1), (18, 4))

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph.

For Node 1:
- Central node: 1
- Leaves: 6, 19, 18
<1, (6, 19, 18)>

For Node 12:
- Central node: 12
- Leaves: 13, 2, 16
<12, (13, 2, 16)>

For Node 15:
- Central node: 15
- Leaves: 9, 16, 16
<15, (9, 16, 16)>

For Node 18:
- Central node: 18
- Leaves: 17, 1, 4
<18, (17, 1, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
