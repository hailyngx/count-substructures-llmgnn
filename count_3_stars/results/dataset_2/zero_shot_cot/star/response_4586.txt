Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 24) (27, 18) (7, 21) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 20) (21, 8) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 28) (8, 21) (8, 23) (8, 11) (23, 8) (28, 21) (28, 22) (28, 26) (28, 25) (26, 28) (26, 25) (26, 0) (26, 17) (9, 29) (9, 2) (29, 9) (29, 13) (29, 0) (29, 3) (19, 17) (19, 12) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 17) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 14) (1, 25) (1, 12) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (25, 28) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 10) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 29) (20, 21) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 16) (3, 29) (3, 5) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 29) (16, 18) (16, 20) (16, 6) (14, 24) (14, 2) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (6, 20) (6, 16) (5, 15) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 10) (4, 11) (4, 17) (12, 15) (12, 19) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
1. Node 15 is connected to nodes 27, 0, and 5.
2. Node 27 is connected to nodes 15, 24, and 18.
3. Node 7 is connected to nodes 21, 2, and 13.
4. Node 21 is connected to nodes 7, 28, and 20.
5. Node 18 is connected to nodes 27, 22, and 16.
6. Node 22 is connected to nodes 18, 28, and 16.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 21, 23, and 11.
8. Node 23 is connected to nodes 8, 11, and 4.
9. Node 28 is connected to nodes 21, 22, and 26.
10. Node 26 is connected to nodes 28, 25, and 0.
11. Node 9 is connected to nodes 29, 2, and 13.
12. Node 29 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 0.
13. Node 20 is connected to nodes 21, 6, and 10.
14. Node 10 is connected to nodes 25, 20, and 5.
15. Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 29, and 9.
16. Node 16 is connected to nodes 18, 20, and 6.
17. Node 11 is connected to nodes 8, 24, and 4.
18. Node 25 is connected to nodes 28, 26, and 1.
19. Node 0 is connected to nodes 15, 26, and 29.
20. Node 3 is connected to nodes 29, 5, and 2.
21. Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 17, and 24.
22. Node 12 is connected to nodes 15, 19, and 1.
23. Node 17 is connected to nodes 26, 19, and 11.
24. Node 6 is connected to nodes 20, 16, and 21.
25. Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and 3.
26. Node 1 is connected to nodes 25, 12, and 19.
27. Node 14 is connected to nodes 24, 2, and 3.

After identifying all the nodes with exactly three connections, we count the number of 3-stars present in the graph, which is 27. 

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
Unique 3-stars: <7, (21, 2, 13)>, <21, (7, 28, 20)>, <18, (27, 22, 16)>, <22, (18, 28, 16)>, <8, (21, 23, 11)>, <23, (8, 11, 4)>, <28, (21, 22, 26)>, <26, (28, 25, 0)>, <9, (29, 2, 13)>, <29, (9, 13, 0)>, <20, (21, 6, 10)>, <10, (25, 20, 5)>, <13, (7, 29, 9)>, <16, (18, 20, 6)>, <11, (8, 24, 4)>, <25, (28, 26, 1)>, <0, (15, 26, 29)>, <3, (29, 5, 2)>, <4, (11, 17, 24)>, <12, (15, 19, 1)>.
