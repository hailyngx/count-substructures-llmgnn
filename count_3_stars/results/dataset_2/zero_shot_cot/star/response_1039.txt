Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 25) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 4) (25, 23) (25, 3) (25, 2) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 15) (8, 21) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 19) (26, 14) (26, 16) (26, 27) (26, 4) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 26) (4, 21) (27, 26) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 13) (20, 14) (20, 5) (20, 10) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 12) (29, 11) (11, 29) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 27) (14, 20) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (10, 27) (10, 20) (19, 22) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 28) (17, 28) (17, 7) (28, 19) (28, 17) (28, 12) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 15) (6, 16) (24, 13) (15, 8) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 13) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 21) (9, 0) (9, 15) (21, 22) (21, 8) (21, 4) (21, 2) (5, 20) (5, 0) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 6) (16, 2) (12, 29) (12, 28) (13, 27) (13, 0) (13, 24) (13, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<2, (25, 19, 21)>
<4, (1, 26, 21)>
<8, (23, 29, 15)>
<14, (1, 26, 27)>
<15, (8, 7, 9)>
<16, (26, 29, 6)>
<19, (22, 1, 2)>
<21, (22, 8, 4)>
<25, (23, 3, 2)>
<27, (26, 14, 10)>
<29, (8, 16, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
