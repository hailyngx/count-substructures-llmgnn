Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 29) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 4) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 28) (14, 17) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 27) (17, 11) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 29) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 8) (27, 17) (27, 12) (4, 22) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 24) (8, 12) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 15) (28, 6) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 19) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 9) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 9) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 21) (10, 19) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 7) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 23) (2, 16) (7, 10) (7, 25) (7, 26) (25, 7) (0, 10) (0, 23) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 20) (11, 13) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 26) (20, 1) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 26) (23, 2) (23, 0) (26, 7) (26, 11) (26, 16) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 12) (24, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by examining each node to see if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by listing the nodes that are connected to three other nodes:

- Node 13: Connected to nodes 22, 29, 11
- Node 22: Connected to nodes 13, 18, 2
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 15, 21, 4
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 3, 19, 28
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 14, 16, 5
- Node 27: Connected to nodes 17, 12, 11
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 12, 4, 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 8, 28, 11
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 17, 18, 19
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 15, 5, 2
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 3, 10, 9
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 19, 21, 0
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 22, 19, 23
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 14, 11, 20
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 13, 17, 6, 1, 26

From the list above, we can see that nodes 13, 22, 3, 15, 5, and 1 form 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars: 
<13, (22, 29, 11)>
<22, (13, 18, 2)>
<3, (15, 21, 4)>
<15, (3, 19, 28)>
<5, (17, 18, 19)>
<1, (14, 11, 20)>
