Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the 3-stars. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 2, 5)
2. Node 1: (1, 3, 8)
3. Node 2: (2, 0, 9)
4. Node 3: (3, 1, 7)
5. Node 4: (4, 3, 8)
6. Node 5: (5, 1, 8)
7. Node 6: (6, 0, 5)
8. Node 7: (7, 3, 4)
9. Node 8: (8, 1, 4)
10. Node 9: (9, 2, 4)

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars identified. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (2, 5, 0)>
<1, (3, 8, 1)>
<2, (0, 9, 2)>
<3, (1, 7, 3)>
<4, (3, 8, 4)>
<5, (1, 8, 5)>
<6, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (3, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 9)>
