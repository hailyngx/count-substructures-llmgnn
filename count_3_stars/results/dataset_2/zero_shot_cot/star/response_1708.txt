Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 10) (17, 23) (17, 15) (20, 22) (20, 11) (25, 27) (25, 18) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 16) (10, 29) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 29) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 9) (1, 15) (1, 23) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 2) (21, 14) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 9) (0, 29) (0, 19) (16, 10) (16, 24) (16, 3) (16, 27) (26, 5) (26, 2) (26, 12) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 2) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 18) (27, 13) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 22) (8, 7) (3, 16) (7, 8) (7, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 8) (18, 25) (18, 27) (18, 7) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 19) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 24) (4, 9) (9, 28) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 19) (19, 0) (19, 23) (19, 9) (19, 12) (13, 24) (13, 27) (11, 20) (11, 6) (29, 10) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 12) (12, 26) (12, 19) (12, 29) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edge list, we can count the 3-stars based on the connected nodes. Let's identify and count the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<2, (15, 2, 26)>
<4, (9, 4, 19)>
<5, (6, 5, 29)>
<6, (28, 6, 11)>
<7, (18, 7, 8)>
<8, (28, 8, 15)>
<9, (4, 9, 19)>
<10, (17, 10, 21)>
<11, (20, 11, 6)>
<12, (29, 12, 26)>
<13, (24, 13, 27)>
<14, (21, 14, 23)>
<15, (17, 15, 2)>
<16, (24, 16, 27)>
<17, (15, 17, 23)>
<18, (7, 18, 25)>
<19, (12, 19, 29)>
<20, (22, 20, 11)>
<21, (10, 21, 27)>
<22, (8, 22, 20)>
<23, (1, 23, 14)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
