Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 9, and 12
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, 7, 4, and 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 2, 11, and 14
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 14, and 4
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 10, 12, and 9
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 11, 10
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 0, 8, 13, and 4
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 11, 12, and 7
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 14, 8, and 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 8
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 14, and 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 8
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 0, 8
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 2, 11, 10, and 13

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (3, 9, 12)>
<3, (1, 5, 11)>
<5, (3, 6, 14)>
<6, (4, 5, 14)>
<0, (2, 9, 10)>
<2, (4, 5, 13)>
<8, (2, 9, 12)>
<11, (3, 5, 14)>
<9, (1, 8, 0)>
<10, (4, 0, 14)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
