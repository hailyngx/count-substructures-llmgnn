Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we can identify the central nodes by checking the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. Then, we can determine the leaves connected to each central node to form the 3-stars.

Let's start by listing the central nodes:

1. Node 0 (Edges: 0-5, 0-9, 0-4)
2. Node 3 (Edges: 3-5, 3-1, 3-7)
3. Node 7 (Edges: 7-5, 7-3, 7-8)

Now, let's list the 3-stars using the central nodes and their connected leaves:

<0, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
