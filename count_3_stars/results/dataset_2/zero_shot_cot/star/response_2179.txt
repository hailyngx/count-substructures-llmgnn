Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 19) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 16) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 8) (19, 12) (19, 5) (19, 15) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 14) (8, 6) (16, 14) (16, 18) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 17) (9, 7) (9, 10) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 1) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 7) (1, 18) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
