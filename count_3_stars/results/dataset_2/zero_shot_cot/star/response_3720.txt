Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 29) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 6) (2, 17) (29, 15) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 8) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 26) (20, 5) (25, 6) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 16) (22, 11) (10, 17) (10, 28) (10, 5) (17, 2) (17, 10) (17, 16) (1, 26) (1, 23) (26, 21) (26, 1) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 16) (28, 29) (28, 10) (28, 19) (28, 24) (13, 26) (13, 19) (5, 7) (5, 20) (5, 10) (5, 19) (19, 28) (19, 13) (19, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 18) (11, 22) (11, 0) (11, 24) (11, 8) (24, 28) (24, 11) (24, 27) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 8) (27, 14) (27, 24) (12, 21) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 25) (6, 23) (4, 23) (23, 2) (23, 1) (23, 6) (23, 4) (8, 29) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (6, 29, 17)>
<6, (2, 15, 23)>
<7, (5, 9, 18)>
<14, (0, 16, 26)>
<16, (8, 14, 18)>
<17, (2, 10, 16)>
<18, (7, 9, 16)>
<19, (5, 13, 28)>
<23, (1, 4, 6)>
<26, (1, 13, 14)>
<28, (10, 19, 24)>
<29, (2, 8, 28)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
