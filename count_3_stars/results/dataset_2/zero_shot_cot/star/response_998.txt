Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as these nodes can potentially be the central nodes of the 3-stars. Nodes with degree 3 are nodes: 8, 9, 11, and 14.

Now, let's determine the possible 3-star patterns for each of these central nodes:

For central node 8:
Connections: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 0), (8, 12)
[<8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>]

For central node 9:
Connections: (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 8), (9, 14)
[<9, (4, 10, 11)>, <9, (4, 10, 14)>]

For central node 11:
Connections: (11, 14), (11, 9), (11, 13), (11, 2)
[<11, (14, 9, 13)>]

For central node 14:
Connections: (14, 3), (14, 10), (14, 11), (14, 2), (14, 0), (14, 9)
[<14, (3, 10, 11)>]

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have: [<8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>, <9, (4, 10, 11)>, <9, (4, 10, 14)>, <11, (14, 9, 13)>, <14, (3, 10, 11)>]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
