Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connecting to them, forming a 3-star structure. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 5 has 3 edges: (5, 2), (5, 11), (5, 3)
- Node 1 has 3 edges: (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 14)
- Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 12)
- Node 0 has 3 edges: (0, 10), (0, 12), (0, 12)

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
- From the identified nodes above, we have the following 3-stars:
<5, (2, 11, 3)>
<1, (3, 11, 14)>
<4, (3, 7, 12)>
<0, (10, 12, 0)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: [4]

Therefore, the final answer (number of 3-stars) is [4].
