Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 4) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 2) (0, 17) (0, 5) (7, 19) (7, 17) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 17) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (12, 6) (12, 4) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 13) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 15) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 19) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 1) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 14) 

Response:
At first, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes with exactly three incident edges will be the central nodes. From the given list of edges, the nodes with three incident edges are: 6, 19, and 4.

Now let's find all possible 3-stars in the graph with these central nodes:

For the central node 6:
- <6, (1, 12, 8)>
- <6, (1, 12, 4)>

For the central node 19:
- <19, (7, 8, 17)>
- <19, (7, 8, 18)>
- <19, (17, 18, 5)>
- <19, (18, 13, 5)>

For the central node 4:
- <4, (9, 12, 13)>
- <4, (9, 12, 15)>
- <4, (9, 15, 16)>
- <4, (12, 13, 18)>
- <4, (12, 13, 1)>
- <4, (12, 15, 8)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [11].
