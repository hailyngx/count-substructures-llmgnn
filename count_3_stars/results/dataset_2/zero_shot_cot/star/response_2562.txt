Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaf nodes connected to it. We can do this by examining each node and counting how many edges it shares with other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 2), (0, 8) -> Central node: 0
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <0, (5, 9, 2)>
    - <0, (5, 9, 8)>

2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 8) -> Central node: 1
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <1, (3, 2, 4)>
    - <1, (3, 2, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 8)>

3. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 0) -> Central node: 2
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <2, (9, 1, 4)>
    - <2, (9, 1, 0)>
    - <2, (9, 4, 0)>

4. Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 7) -> Central node: 3
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <3, (9, 1, 7)>

5. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 2) -> Central node: 4
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <4, (9, 1, 6)>
    - <4, (9, 1, 2)>
    - <4, (9, 6, 2)>

6. Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0), (5, 7) -> Central node: 5
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <5, (6, 8, 0)>
    - <5, (6, 8, 7)>
    - <5, (6, 0, 7)>

7. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 4), (6, 8) -> Central node: 6
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <6, (5, 7, 4)>
    - <6, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <6, (5, 4, 8)>

8. Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 6) -> Central node: 7
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <7, (5, 9, 3)>
    - <7, (5, 9, 6)>
    - <7, (5, 3, 6)>

9. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 1), (8, 6), (8, 0) -> Central node: 8
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <8, (5, 1, 6)>
    - <8, (5, 1, 0)>
    - <8, (5, 6, 0)>

10. Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0) -> Central node: 9
    Possible 3-stars:
    - <9, (4, 2, 3)>
    - <9, (4, 2, 7)>
    - <9, (4, 2, 0)>
    - <9, (4, 3, 7)>
    - <9, (4, 3, 0)>
    - <9, (4, 7, 0)>

There are a total of 23 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the count of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
