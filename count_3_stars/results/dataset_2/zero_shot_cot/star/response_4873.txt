Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 18) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 14) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 18) (7, 6) (7, 19) (12, 16) (12, 17) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 8) (18, 13) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (13, 3) (13, 18) (0, 10) (0, 8) (15, 16) (15, 17) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 8) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, identify all nodes with 3 edges incident to each one. These are potential central nodes for 3-stars. 
Nodes with 3 incident edges: 11, 16, 3, 10, 9, 18, 6, 19, 2, and 14.

Next, check if these nodes indeed form a 3-star by having exactly 3 adjacent nodes. 
- Node 11: (16, 10, 19)
- Node 16: (11, 12, 15)
- Node 3: (1, 6, 13)
- Node 10: (11, 0, 14)
- Node 9: (16, 10, 4)
- Node 18: (3, 4, 8)
- Node 6: (3, 7, 5)
- Node 19: (11, 4, 8)
- Node 2: (1, 6, 14)
- Node 14: (10, 2)

Hence, we found 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <11, (16, 10, 19)>, <16, (11, 12, 15)>, <3, (1, 6, 13)>, <10, (11, 0, 14)>, <9, (16, 10, 4)>, <18, (3, 4, 8)>, and <6, (3, 7, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
