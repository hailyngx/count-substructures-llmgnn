Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 2) (27, 24) (27, 20) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 21) (22, 23) (22, 15) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 25) (23, 28) (2, 0) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 4) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 23) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 4) (28, 10) (21, 3) (21, 28) (11, 17) (11, 29) (19, 5) (19, 24) (19, 13) (19, 20) (9, 2) (9, 29) (9, 10) (29, 11) (29, 9) (29, 25) (29, 4) (7, 18) (7, 16) (7, 15) (16, 7) (26, 23) (26, 8) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 7) (15, 25) (17, 6) (17, 11) (20, 27) (20, 19) (20, 14) (20, 10) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (24, 0) (24, 27) (24, 19) (24, 25) (25, 23) (25, 29) (25, 15) (25, 24) (8, 1) (8, 26) (8, 12) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 10) (4, 5) (4, 28) (4, 29) (10, 28) (10, 9) (10, 20) (10, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (15, 24, 2)>
<2, (0, 18, 13)>
<5, (1, 6, 19)>
<6, (5, 28, 17)>
<9, (2, 29, 10)>
<10, (28, 9, 20)>
<13, (2, 19, 14)>
<14, (20, 13, 10)>
<15, (22, 7, 25)>
<17, (6, 11, 28)>
<19, (5, 24, 13)>
<20, (27, 19, 10)>
<23, (22, 26, 25)>
<24, (27, 19, 25)>
<25, (23, 29, 15)>
<28, (23, 21, 4)>
<29, (11, 25, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get the total number of 3-stars in the given graph as [16].
