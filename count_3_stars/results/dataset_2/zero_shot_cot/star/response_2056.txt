Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 4) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 3) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 6
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 6
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3

Now, let's find the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 12)>
<0, (3, 7, 12)>
<0, (5, 6, 14)>
<0, (2, 7, 10)>
<0, (3, 7, 10)>
<1, (4, 7, 11)>
<4, (1, 6, 14)>
<5, (0, 6, 14)>
<6, (0, 5, 13)>
<7, (0, 2, 12)>
<8, (2, 9, 13)>
<9, (8, 13, 14)>
<10, (0, 7, 12)>
<11, (1, 3, 14)>
<12, (0, 7, 10)>
<13, (8, 9, 6)>
<14, (5, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
