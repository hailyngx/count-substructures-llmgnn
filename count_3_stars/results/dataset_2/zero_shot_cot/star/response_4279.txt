Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 11) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, satisfying the definition of a 3-star.

1. Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 13), (4, 14), (4, 2)
   - <4, (7, 13, 14)>
   - <4, (7, 2, 13)>

2. Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 9), (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 8)
   - <7, (4, 9, 5)>
   - <7, (4, 1, 8)>
   - <7, (5, 6, 1)> (Note: 6 is indirectly connected to node 7 through node 5)

3. Node 5: (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 12)
   - <5, (7, 6, 12)>

4. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 11), (6, 12), (6, 8)
   - <6, (5, 11, 12)>

5. Node 12: (12, 5), (12, 6), (12, 3), (12, 13), (12, 8)
   - <12, (5, 6, 3)>
   - <12, (5, 6, 13)>
   - <12, (5, 6, 8)>

6. Node 8: (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 10), (8, 12)
   - <8, (7, 6, 3)>

7. Node 9: (9, 7), (9, 0), (9, 14), (9, 10)
   - <9, (7, 0, 14)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9, as counted inside brackets.]
