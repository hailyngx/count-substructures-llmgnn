Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 8) (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 18) (21, 17) (8, 15) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 26) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 21) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 17) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (2, 3) (2, 26) (2, 28) (19, 1) (19, 26) (19, 0) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 2) (26, 19) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 27) (29, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 25) (7, 10) (7, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (18, 21) (18, 23) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 20) (4, 14) (4, 6) (12, 21) (12, 25) (12, 0) (24, 27) (24, 17) (27, 9) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 5) (20, 9) (20, 18) (5, 27) (5, 25) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 28) (17, 21) (17, 23) (17, 24) (17, 27) (0, 19) (0, 29) (0, 12) (28, 1) (28, 2) (28, 25) (16, 10) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. 3-star with center node 1: <1, (10, 19, 21)>
2. 3-star with center node 10: <10, (1, 11, 16)>
3. 3-star with center node 11: <11, (10, 14, 18)>
4. 3-star with center node 12: <12, (0, 21, 25)>
5. 3-star with center node 14: <14, (4, 11, 18)>
6. 3-star with center node 15: <15, (8, 9, 26)>
7. 3-star with center node 17: <17, (21, 23, 24)>
8. 3-star with center node 18: <18, (11, 14, 20)>
9. 3-star with center node 21: <21, (1, 17, 23)>
10. 3-star with center node 25: <25, (5, 12, 14)>
11. 3-star with center node 26: <26, (2, 13, 19)>
12. 3-star with center node 27: <27, (5, 9, 24)>
13. 3-star with center node 28: <28, (1, 2, 25)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
