Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 9) (15, 12) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 5) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (16, 2) (16, 1) (16, 18) (18, 10) (18, 5) (18, 16) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 9) (6, 13) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<3, (7, 10, 19)>
<7, (4, 8, 17)>
<9, (2, 3, 14)>
<10, (11, 13, 18)>
<11, (1, 4, 10)>
<12, (9, 14, 15)>
<13, (6, 10, 18)>
<14, (9, 12, 19)>
<16, (1, 2, 18)>
<1, (11, 16, 17)>
<2, (8, 9, 16)>
<4, (7, 11, 14)>
<5, (0, 18, 19)>
<6, (13, 15, 17)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 15. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
