Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 4) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 10) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

Let's first identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 13, 6
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 13, 6
- Node 3 has neighbors: 7, 10, 5
- Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 2, 5
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 2, 10
- Node 8 has neighbors: 14, 11, 3
- Node 9 has neighbors: 11, 1, 4
- Node 12 has neighbors: 14, 8, 6

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 13, 6)>
<2, (1, 13, 6)>
<3, (7, 10, 5)>
<4, (3, 2, 5)>
<6, (0, 2, 10)>
<8, (14, 11, 3)>
<9, (11, 1, 4)>
<12, (14, 8, 6)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
