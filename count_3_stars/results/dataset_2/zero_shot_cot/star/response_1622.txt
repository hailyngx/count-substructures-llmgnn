The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 24) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 29) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 17) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 2) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 10) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 26) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 6) (23, 25) (23, 15) (0, 20) (0, 5) (0, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 29) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 10) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 29) (29, 22) (29, 5) (29, 17) (29, 18) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 11) (26, 22) (26, 7) (26, 3) (26, 15) (9, 22) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 27) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 18) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 19) (24, 13) (24, 7) (19, 25) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 14) (15, 23) (15, 26) (15, 16) (2, 20) (2, 1) (4, 13) (4, 19) (10, 25) (10, 6) (10, 9) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 27) (27, 9) (27, 18) (14, 13) (14, 19) 

Response:
Let's first identify all 3-star configurations in the given graph using the information provided.

1. From the list of edges, we can see the connections for each node:
- Node 0: (0, 20), (0, 5), (0, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 17), (1, 11), (1, 2)
- Node 2: (2, 20), (2, 1)
- Node 3: (3, 26)
- Node 4: (4, 13), (4, 19)
- Node 5: (5, 0), (6, 5), (5, 18), (5, 29)
- Node 6: (6, 8), (6, 5), (6, 10)
- Node 7: (7, 21), (7, 12), (7, 24), (7, 26)
- Node 8: (8, 20), (8, 11), (8, 6)
- Node 9: (9, 22), (9, 0), (9, 10), (9, 27)
- Node 10: (10, 25), (10, 6), (10, 9)
- Node 11: (11, 1), (11, 8), (11, 12), (11, 19)
- Node 12: (12, 7), (12, 18), (12, 11)
- Node 13: (13, 22), (13, 4), (13, 24), (13, 14)
- Node 14: (14, 13), (14, 19)
- Node 15: (15, 23), (15, 26), (15, 16)
- Node 16: (16, 28), (16, 15)
- Node 17: (17, 21), (17, 1), (17, 29)
- Node 18: (18, 5), (18, 29), (18, 12), (18, 28), (18, 27)
- Node 19: (19, 25), (19, 11), (19, 4), (19, 14)
- Node 20: (20, 0), (20, 8), (20, 2)
- Node 21: (21, 7), (21, 17)
- Node 22: (22, 13), (22, 26), (22, 9), (22, 29)
- Node 23: (23, 25), (23, 15)
- Node 24: (24, 13), (24, 7)
- Node 25: (25, 19), (25, 23), (25, 10)
- Node 26: (26, 22), (26, 7), (26, 3), (26, 15)
- Node 27: (27, 9), (27, 18)
- Node 28: (28, 18), (28, 16)
- Node 29: (29, 22), (29, 5), (29, 17), (29, 18)

2. Now, let's identify the 3-star configurations:
- From the connections above, we find that Node 13, 22, 4, 24, 7, 21, 2, 1, 26, 9, and 20 have the potential to be the central nodes of 3-stars.

3. Counting the number of 3-star configurations:
By examining the connections, we find that there are <13, (22, 4, 24)>, <22, (13, 26, 9)>, and <7, (21, 12, 24)> as the unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
