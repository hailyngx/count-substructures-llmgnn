Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 28) (22, 14) (22, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 17) (6, 20) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 19) (1, 5) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 7) (12, 4) (29, 17) (29, 11) (4, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 25) (16, 25) (16, 18) (16, 10) (28, 13) (28, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 23) (3, 13) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 27) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 24) (23, 14) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 24) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 11) (15, 26) (15, 8) (20, 6) (20, 7) (20, 18) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 15) (8, 11) (25, 14) (25, 19) (25, 16) (25, 18) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 20) (18, 25) (24, 10) (24, 23) (11, 5) (11, 29) (11, 26) (11, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-star configurations found in the graph:

<3, (13, 22, 27)>
<5, (1, 11, 19)>
<7, (0, 8, 20)>
<8, (0, 11, 15)>
<10, (0, 16, 24)>
<11, (5, 8, 26)>
<12, (4, 7, 21)>
<14, (17, 22, 25)>
<15, (8, 15, 26)>
<16, (10, 18, 25)>
<17, (13, 14, 29)>
<18, (1, 16, 20)>
<19, (5, 17, 25)>
<20, (6, 7, 18)>
<21, (1, 12, 18)>
<22, (3, 14, 22)>
<23, (14, 24, 26)>
<24, (23, 10, 24)>
<25, (14, 16, 18)>
<26, (11, 15, 23)>
<27, (3, 13, 28)>
<28, (13, 27, 28)>
<29, (11, 17, 29)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
