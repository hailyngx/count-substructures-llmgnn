Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it. Since each 3-star contributes one to the total count, we can count the unique 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 12)>
<1, (6, 8, 11)>
<2, (3, 7, 10)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 10)>
<6, (0, 1, 13)>
<7, (2, 3, 13)>
<8, (1, 4, 14)>
<9, (4, 9, 10)>
<10, (2, 5, 11)>
<11, (1, 5, 6)>
<12, (0, 4, 7)>
<13, (6, 7, 8)>
<14, (8, 9, 14)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [15] 3-stars in total.
