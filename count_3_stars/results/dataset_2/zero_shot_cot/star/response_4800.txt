Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (3, 10) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 5) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (0, 16) (0, 14) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (4, 14) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 15) (17, 1) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 5) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 10) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 14) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors, forming a possible 3-star. 

Nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 1: (15, 5, 7)
- Node 2: (14, 18, 8)
- Node 3: (12, 10, 11)
- Node 4: (14)
- Node 5: (18, 1, 19)
- Node 6: (10, 2, 7)
- Node 7: (5, 1, 10)
- Node 8: (2, 9, 10)
- Node 9: (11, 15, 8)
- Node 10: (3, 6, 8)
- Node 11: (9, 3, 12)
- Node 12: (16, 14, 3)
- Node 13: (1)
- Node 14: (15, 2, 0, 4, 12)
- Node 15: (1, 9, 17, 14)
- Node 16: (0, 11, 12)
- Node 17: (1, 15)
- Node 18: (2, 5)
- Node 19: (5)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (15, 5, 7)>
2. <2, (14, 18, 8)>
3. <3, (12, 10, 11)>
4. <5, (18, 1, 19)>
5. <6, (10, 2, 7)>
6. <7, (5, 1, 10)>
7. <8, (2, 9, 10)>
8. <9, (11, 15, 8)>
9. <10, (3, 6, 8)>
10. <11, (9, 3, 12)>
11. <12, (16, 14, 3)>
12. <14, (15, 2, 0)>
13. <15, (1, 9, 17)>
14. <16, (0, 11, 12)>
15. <17, (1, 15)>

Therefore, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
