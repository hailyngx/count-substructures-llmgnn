Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [3] 3-stars in total.
