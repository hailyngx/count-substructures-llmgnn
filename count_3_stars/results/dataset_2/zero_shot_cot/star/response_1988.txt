Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 26) (8, 4) (8, 24) (23, 7) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 5) (4, 3) (28, 0) (28, 25) (28, 20) (29, 14) (29, 3) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 27) (2, 19) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 12) (6, 17) (6, 15) (21, 10) (21, 19) (15, 6) (15, 5) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 12) (26, 11) (26, 14) (26, 7) (1, 10) (1, 20) (1, 9) (1, 0) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 25) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 24) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (19, 2) (19, 21) (19, 27) (20, 10) (20, 28) (20, 1) (20, 27) (0, 28) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 25) (0, 12) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 13) (27, 17) (27, 19) (27, 20) (27, 7) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 12) (12, 18) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 22) (25, 28) (25, 16) (25, 0) (7, 23) (7, 26) (7, 9) (7, 27) (22, 12) (3, 4) (3, 29) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. First, identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 10 has neighbors [11, 21, 1]
- Node 11 has neighbors [10, 26, 7]
- Node 4 has neighbors [8, 24, 5]
- Node 28 has neighbors [0, 25, 20]
- Node 29 has neighbors [14, 3, -]
- Node 17 has neighbors [13, 6, 16]
- Node 2 has neighbors [19, 0, -]
- Node 18 has neighbors [9, 5, 12]
- Node 6 has neighbors [17, 15, -]
- Node 21 has neighbors [10, 19, -]
- Node 15 has neighbors [6, 5, -]
- Node 14 has neighbors [29, 26, 12]
- Node 26 has neighbors [11, 14, 7]
- Node 1 has neighbors [10, 20, 9]
- Node 16 has neighbors [17, 13, 25]
- Node 13 has neighbors [17, 16, 24]
- Node 9 has neighbors [18, 1, 7]
- Node 19 has neighbors [2, 21, 27]
- Node 20 has neighbors [10, 28, 1]
- Node 0 has neighbors [28, 2, 1, 25, 12]
- Node 24 has neighbors [8, 4, 13]
- Node 27 has neighbors [17, 19, 20, 7]
- Node 5 has neighbors [4, 18, 15, 12]

2. Next, identify all 3-stars that have a unique center:
- <10, (11, 21, 1)>
- <11, (10, 26, 7)>
- <4, (8, 24, 5)>
- <28, (0, 25, 20)>
- <29, (14, 3, -)>
- <17, (13, 6, 16)>
- <2, (19, 0, -)>
- <18, (9, 5, 12)>
- <6, (17, 15, -)>
- <21, (10, 19, -)>
- <15, (6, 5, -)>
- <14, (29, 26, 12)>
- <26, (11, 14, 7)>
- <1, (10, 20, 9)>
- <16, (17, 13, 25)>
- <13, (17, 16, 24)>
- <9, (18, 1, 7)>
- <19, (2, 21, 27)>
- <20, (10, 28, 1)>
- <0, (28, 2, 1)>
- <24, (8, 4, 13)>
- <27, (17, 19, 20)>
- <5, (4, 18, 15)>
- <12, (18, 14, 0, 5)>

3. The total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [25].
