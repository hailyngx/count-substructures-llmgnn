Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 22) (16, 20) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 13) (2, 22) (2, 12) (18, 17) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 20) (14, 29) (9, 22) (9, 4) (22, 16) (22, 2) (22, 9) (22, 5) (1, 15) (1, 28) (1, 13) (15, 23) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 6) (13, 23) (13, 1) (13, 12) (17, 18) (17, 3) (21, 27) (21, 5) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 28) (4, 3) (12, 16) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 3) (19, 8) (19, 29) (19, 27) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 25) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 29) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 28) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 25) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 20) (27, 26) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 20) (26, 27) (26, 29) (29, 14) (29, 19) (29, 3) (29, 25) (29, 26) (5, 0) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 20) (20, 16) (20, 14) (20, 27) (20, 24) (20, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are part of a 3-star. This includes the center node and the three leaves connected to it.

Nodes in 3-stars: {16, 11, 12, 22, 8, 23, 2, 18, 28, 24, 14, 9, 15, 10, 13, 17, 4, 0, 6, 5, 3, 1, 21, 29}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

[<16, (11, 12, 22)>, <8, (23, 19, 8)>, <23, (15, 24, 13)>, <2, (22, 12, 2)>, <18, (17, 3, 18)>, <0, (28, 24, 5)>, <14, (6, 20, 29)>, <9, (22, 4, 9)>, <15, (1, 10, 15)>, <13, (23, 12, 13)>, <17, (18, 3, 17)>, <21, (27, 5, 21)>, <4, (9, 12, 4)>, <6, (14, 10, 6)>, <3, (17, 4, 3)>, <1, (15, 28, 1)>, <29, (14, 19, 29)>, <5, (0, 22, 5)>, <20, (16, 14, 20)>]

Total number of 3-stars: [18]
