Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then verify if these nodes and their connections form a 3-star structure.

Let's start by listing the potential 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (0, 4, 2)>
<7, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (10, 8, 12)>
<13, (5, 0, 1)>
<14, (8, 9, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
