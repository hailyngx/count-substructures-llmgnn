Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<6, (9, 8, 5)>
<1, (9, 2, 8)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>
<2, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (6, 1, 2)>
<0, (6, 3, 7)>
<7, (9, 3, 0)>
<4, (2, 0, 9)>

There are a total of [10] 3-star structures in the given graph.
