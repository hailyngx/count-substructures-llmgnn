Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 4) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 18) (7, 1) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (8, 15) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 17) (16, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 17) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given data:

- From node 3: <3, (4, 9, 15)>
- From node 15: <15, (3, 5, 8)>, <15, (5, 13, 16)>
- From node 1: <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- From node 10: <10, (11, 12, 18)>
- From node 11: <11, (10, 12, 18)>
- From node 7: <7, (1, 13, 15)>
- From node 12: <12, (10, 13, 15)>
- From node 4: <4, (2, 6, 18)>
- From node 18: <18, (4, 11, 16)>
- From node 0: <0, (9, 14, 16)>
- From node 14: <14, (0, 5, 1)>
- From node 8: <8, (9, 15, 9)>
- From node 9: <9, (0, 1, 3)>
- From node 19: <19, (2, 16, 17)>
- From node 16: <16, (0, 17, 19)>, <16, (2, 15, 19)>
- From node 6: <6, (1, 4, 17)>
- From node 17: <17, (2, 6, 16)>
- From node 5: <5, (14, 15, 16)>
- From node 2: <2, (4, 16, 19)>, <2, (17, 16, 19)>
- From node 13: <13, (7, 12, 15)>

So, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given data is [20].
