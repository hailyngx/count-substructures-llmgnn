Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 19) (2, 9) (8, 19) (4, 18) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 1) (0, 7) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 16) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 6) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 12) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 1) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 16) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 16) (10, 14) (10, 3) (6, 4) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15)
