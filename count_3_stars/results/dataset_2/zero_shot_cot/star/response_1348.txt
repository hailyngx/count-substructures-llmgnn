Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated using the degree of nodes. As per the graph given, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree = 4
- Node 1: degree = 3
- Node 2: degree = 4
- Node 3: degree = 2
- Node 4: degree = 5
- Node 5: degree = 5
- Node 6: degree = 5
- Node 7: degree = 2
- Node 8: degree = 4
- Node 9: degree = 5
- Node 10: degree = 3
- Node 11: degree = 5
- Node 12: degree = 4
- Node 13: degree = 3
- Node 14: degree = 4

The number of 3-stars can be determined by the number of pairs of adjacent nodes to each node. Since a 3-star involves a center node connected to 3 other nodes, we look for pairs of nodes that share a common neighbor.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 10, 12)>
- <1, (2, 5, 11)>
- <2, (1, 5, 14)>
- <3, (6, 8, 13)>
- <4, (8, 11, 14)>
- <5, (1, 9, 11)>
- <6, (0, 10, 12)>
- <7, (9, 13, 6)>
- <8, (4, 9, 13)>
- <9, (5, 7, 6)>
- <10, (0, 6, 12)>
- <11, (1, 4, 5)>
- <12, (0, 6, 10)>
- <13, (3, 8, 7)>
- <14, (1, 2, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars observed: 15.

Therefore, the answer is [15].
