Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 15) (21, 29) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 13) (5, 6) (5, 24) (22, 26) (22, 24) (22, 20) (22, 29) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 22) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (10, 1) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 28) (11, 9) (11, 20) (23, 25) (23, 15) (23, 2) (23, 24) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 27) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 7) (24, 5) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 16) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 27) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 19) (3, 0) (3, 4) (16, 24) (16, 20) (28, 15) (28, 0) (28, 13) (2, 26) (2, 7) (2, 23) (12, 21) (12, 8) (20, 22) (20, 11) (20, 16) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 22) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 4) (18, 0) (27, 8) (27, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll need to identify the central node and its three neighboring nodes for each 3-star.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (21, 14, 10)>
<21, (1, 12, 15)>
<6, (9, 5, 19)>
<9, (6, 8, 0)>
<5, (6, 24, 5)>
<22, (26, 24, 20)>
<26, (22, 14, 2)>
<7, (22, 25, 14)>
<25, (7, 23, 25)>
<10, (1, 15, 23)>
<15, (21, 23, 28)>
<11, (9, 20, 1)>
<23, (25, 15, 2)>
<8, (9, 12, 27)>
<14, (1, 26, 7)>
<24, (5, 22, 23)>
<17, (26, 7, 27)>
<0, (9, 3, 28)>
<3, (0, 4, 3)>
<16, (24, 20, 16)>
<28, (15, 0, 13)>
<2, (26, 7, 23)>
<12, (21, 8, 12)>
<20, (22, 11, 16)>
<4, (3, 19, 13)>
<19, (6, 0, 4)>
<29, (21, 22, 29)>
<13, (9, 28, 4)>
<18, (0, 18, 0)>
<27, (8, 17, 27)>

By listing the unique 3-stars, we have: 
<1, (21, 14, 10)>, <6, (9, 5, 19)>, <22, (26, 24, 20)>, <7, (22, 25, 14)>, <10, (1, 15, 23)>, <11, (9, 20, 1)>, <8, (9, 12, 27)>, <16, (24, 20, 16)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
