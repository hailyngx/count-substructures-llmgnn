Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 13) (29, 10) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 15) (25, 12) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 7) (15, 25) (15, 19) (20, 19) (20, 11) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 11) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 19) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 12) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 16) (26, 3) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 17) (9, 0) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 27) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 29) (13, 4) (24, 2) (24, 9) (10, 29) (10, 0) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 21) (11, 20) (11, 18) (11, 5) (19, 15) (19, 20) (19, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (16, 22) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 28) (8, 16) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 12) (28, 27) (21, 23) (21, 12) (27, 9) (27, 28) (12, 25) (12, 14) (12, 28) (12, 21) (6, 4) (6, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step.

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 19.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 14, and 28.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 25, and 26.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 13, and 18.
   - Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 11.
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 22, and 28.
   - Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 29, and 24.
   - Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 18, and 20.
   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 21, and 25.
   - Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 16, and 17.
   - Node 17 is connected to nodes 16, 26, and 28.
   - Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 14.
   - Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 15, and 20.
   - Node 22 is connected to nodes 9, 16, and 26.
   - Node 23 is connected to nodes 1, 21, and 26.
   - Node 28 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 17.

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
   - <0, (9, 14, 19)>
   - <1, (7, 14, 28)>
   - <3, (7, 25, 26)>
   - <4, (6, 13, 18)>
   - <5, (2, 7, 11)>
   - <9, (0, 22, 28)>
   - <10, (0, 29, 24)>
   - <11, (5, 18, 20)>
   - <12, (14, 21, 25)>
   - <16, (6, 16, 17)>
   - <17, (16, 26, 28)>
   - <18, (4, 11, 14)>
   - <19, (0, 15, 20)>
   - <22, (9, 16, 26)>
   - <23, (1, 21, 26)>
   - <28, (1, 9, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
