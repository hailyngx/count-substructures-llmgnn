Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 0) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (7, 18) (7, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 16, 10)>
<2, (8, 13, 19)>
<3, (1, 14, 19)>
<4, (5, 18, 6)>
<5, (11, 15, 14)>
<6, (4, 17, 0)>
<7, (18, 13, 7)>
<9, (19, 12, 9)>
<11, (5, 14, 19)>
<12, (9, 3, 13)>
<13, (2, 12, 7)>
<14, (5, 3, 11)>
<16, (1, 3, 8)>
<18, (4, 7, 17)>
<19, (9, 3, 11)>

Now count the total number of 3-stars: [15]
