Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, we can identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, for each node in the graph, we can check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we can list out the 3-stars based on this information. 

Let's list out the central nodes with their adjacent nodes: 
- Central node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7.
- Central node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Central node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Central node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 9.
- Central node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Central node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 9.
- Central node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 9.
- Central node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 9.
- Central node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 4.
- Central node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.

Now, based on the central nodes and their adjacent nodes, we can identify the 3-stars. 

So, the 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
