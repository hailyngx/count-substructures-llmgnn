Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<7, (9, 10, 12)>
<10, (7, 0, 14)>
<0, (5, 3, 2)>
<12, (4, 7, 8)>
<14, (4, 10, 2)>
<13, (5, 1, *)> (This one only has 2 edges listed, * represents an unknown node)
