Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 16) (4, 21) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 29) (8, 15) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 27) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 28) (27, 13) (27, 14) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 21) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (28, 12) (28, 18) (20, 21) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 23) (11, 3) (23, 11) (23, 2) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 0) (2, 23) (2, 22) (2, 10) (2, 0) (22, 2) (22, 10) (22, 25) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 29) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 16) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 10) (25, 13) (25, 22) (25, 0) (25, 15) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 25) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 18) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 14) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 15) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 29) (10, 2) (10, 22) (10, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star. 

Let's first list out all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 1, 11)>
<9, (5, 15, 7)>
<4, (16, 21, 29)>
<7, (9, 11, 14)>
<13, (12, 25, 27)>
<12, (5, 13, 28)>
<27, (13, 14, 25)>
<19, (26, -)>
<26, (19, 18, 21)>
<1, (5, 9, 17)>
<17, (1, 3, -)>
<28, (12, 18, -)>
<20, (21, -,-)>
<11, (5, 7, 23)>
<23, (11, 2, -)>
<3, (17, 11, 0)>
<2, (23, 22, 10)>
<22, (2, 10, 25)>
<16, (4, 21, 29)>
<21, (4, 26, 20)>
<6, (24, -,-)>
<24, (6, 10, -)>
<25, (13, 22, 0)>
<0, (3, 2, 25)>
<15, (9, 8, 25)>
<29, (8, 16, 14)>
<18, (5, 26, 28)>
<14, (7, 27, 1)>
<10, (2, 22, 24)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.
