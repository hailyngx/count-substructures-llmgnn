Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each 3-star. Let's begin by listing all the 3-stars:

<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<5, (3, 1, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 2)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (2, 1, 6)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (4, 8, 0)>
<6, (9, 0, 7)>
<6, (7, 8, 4)>
<6, (8, 0, 9)>
<8, (6, 0, 3)>
<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 0)>
<3, (5, 8, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (6, 8, 3)>

As we can see, there are 18 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
