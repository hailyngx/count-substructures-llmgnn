Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, which will be our potential center nodes for the 3-stars. In this case, nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have degree 3. 

Next, let's check each potential center node to see if it forms a 3-star. We will look for nodes connected to the center node and count how many edges those nodes share with each other. If the count is 3, then we have a 3-star. 

Here are the 3-stars found:
<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<2, (8, 4, 5)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 5 in total. 
Therefore, the final answer is [5].
