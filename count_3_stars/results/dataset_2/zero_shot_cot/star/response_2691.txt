Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (7, 13) (6, 15) (6, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 19) (8, 7) (8, 19) (8, 11) (13, 7) (13, 6) (10, 11) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 14) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 0) (1, 2) (1, 14) (17, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 16) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 5) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 3) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars based on the given edges:
- <4, (3, 7, 19)>
- <7, (4, 12, 13)>
- <13, (6, 7, 13)>
- <11, (3, 8, 10)>
- <18, (2, 14, 16)>
- <5, (0, 14, 17)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <12, (0, 7, 16)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: <4, (3, 7, 19)>, <7, (4, 12, 13)>, <13, (6, 7, 13)>, <11, (3, 8, 10)>, <18, (2, 14, 16)>, <5, (0, 14, 17)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <12, (0, 7, 16)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
