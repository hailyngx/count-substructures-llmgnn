Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 14) (16, 5) (5, 16) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 29) (13, 15) (20, 21) (20, 3) (20, 14) (25, 7) (25, 18) (28, 10) (28, 2) (29, 13) (22, 16) (22, 27) (22, 10) (22, 24) (26, 24) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 7) (3, 20) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (24, 22) (24, 26) (7, 25) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 23) (27, 22) (27, 19) (17, 8) (17, 26) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 23) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 14) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 6) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 21) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 18) (18, 25) (18, 3) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 6) (2, 28) (2, 7) (2, 4) (6, 4) (6, 23) (6, 18) (6, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 27) (19, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find nodes that follow the structure of a 3-star. 

Let's start by identifying nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes: 16, 1, 0
- Node 16 is connected to nodes: 11, 22, 14
- Node 7 is connected to nodes: 25, 26, 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes: 11, 9, 13
- Node 13 is connected to nodes: 9, 8, 29
- Node 20 is connected to nodes: 21, 3, 14
- Node 21 is connected to nodes: 20, 26, 14
- Node 22 is connected to nodes: 16, 27, 10
- Node 26 is connected to nodes: 24, 21, 17
- Node 3 is connected to nodes: 20, 7, 19
- Node 18 is connected to nodes: 25, 3, 1
- Node 2 is connected to nodes: 28, 7, 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes: 4, 23, 18
- Node 19 is connected to nodes: 9, 3, 27

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found: 
<11, (16, 1, 0)>
<16, (11, 22, 14)>
<7, (25, 26, 3)>
<8, (11, 9, 13)>
<13, (9, 8, 29)>
<20, (21, 3, 14)>
<21, (20, 26, 14)>
<22, (16, 27, 10)>
<26, (24, 21, 17)>
<3, (20, 7, 19)>
<18, (25, 3, 1)>
<2, (28, 7, 4)>
<6, (4, 23, 18)>
<19, (9, 3, 27)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
