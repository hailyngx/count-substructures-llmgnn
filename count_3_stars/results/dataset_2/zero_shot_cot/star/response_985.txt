Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 14) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. This means we are looking for nodes that have degree 3 and are arranged in a star pattern.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 10)>
<1, (9, 4, 12)>
<3, (6, 7, 4)>
<10, (9, 11, 8)>
<11, (6, 10, 7)>
<4, (9, 1, 3)>
<8, (10, 11, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 13)>
<0, (6, 8, 14)>
<14, (5, 0, 2)>
<13, (5, 14, -)>
<7, (3, 11, 0)>
<2, (9, 4, 14)>
<12, (1, 11, 8)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
