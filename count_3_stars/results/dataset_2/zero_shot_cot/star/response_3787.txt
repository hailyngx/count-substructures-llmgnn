Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <4, (1, 3, 5)>
2. <7, (0, 6, 9)>
3. <6, (2, 7, 9)>
4. <9, (6, 7, 8)>
5. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
6. <8, (1, 3, 5)>
7. <0, (1, 7, -)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
