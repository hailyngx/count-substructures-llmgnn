Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node to see if there are 3-stars present.

1 is connected to: 5, 9, 3, 2
2 is connected to: 9, 1, 6, 7, 0
3 is connected to: 1, 0, 8, 4
4 is connected to: 5, 6, 3
5 is connected to: 9, 1, 7, 4
6 is connected to: 7, 2, 4, 0
7 is connected to: 5, 6, 2, 8, 0
8 is connected to: 9, 3, 7
9 is connected to: 5, 8, 2, 1

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<1, (5, 2, 4)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (9, 3, 4)>
<1, (9, 2, 4)>
<5, (9, 3, 2)>
<5, (9, 3, 4)>
<5, (9, 2, 4)>

So, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
