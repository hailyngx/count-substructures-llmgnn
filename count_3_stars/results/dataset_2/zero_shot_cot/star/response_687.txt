Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 17) (8, 3) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 18) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 13) (18, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 15) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (19, 3) (19, 9) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 16) (10, 14) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 9) (9, 19) (9, 16) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
Node 0: 1, 8, 12
Node 1: 0, 5, 15
Node 2: 7, 11, 14
Node 3: 8, 15, 19
Node 4: 6, 11, 12
Node 5: 1, 10, 14, 17, 18
Node 6: 4, 7, 10, 16
Node 7: 2, 6, 13
Node 8: 0, 3
Node 9: 16, 19
Node 10: 5, 6, 14, 16
Node 11: 2, 4
Node 12: 0, 4, 17
Node 13: 7, 17, 18
Node 14: 2, 5, 10
Node 15: 1, 3, 17
Node 16: 6, 9, 10
Node 17: 1, 5, 12, 13, 15
Node 18: 5, 13
Node 19: 3, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
[<1, (15, 5, 17)>, <2, (11, 5, 14)>, <4, (11, 12, 6)>, <5, (10, 14, 17)>, <6, (7, 10, 16)>, <10, (5, 14, 16)>, <12, (0, 4, 17)>, <13, (7, 17, 18)>, <14, (2, 5, 10)>, <15, (1, 17, 5)>, <16, (6, 9, 10)>, <17, (1, 13, 5)>, <14, (2, 10, 5)>]
