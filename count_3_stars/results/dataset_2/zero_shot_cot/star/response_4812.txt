Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the central node and its connected nodes. 

Starting with node 0:
1. <0, (9, 6, 7)>
2. <0, (9, 6, 4)>

Moving on to node 1:
3. <1, (6, 4, 8)>

Proceeding to node 2:
4. <2, (9, 8, 3)>

Next is node 3:
5. <3, (6, 8, 7)>

Moving to node 4:
6. <4, (6, 8, 0)>

Proceeding to node 5:
7. <5, (9, 6, 0)>

Next is node 6:
8. <6, (5, 9, 1)>
9. <6, (9, 5, 1)>
10. <6, (9, 5, 3)>
11. <6, (4, 8, 1)>
12. <6, (4, 8, 3)>
13. <6, (4, 0, 1)>
14. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
15. <6, (1, 4, 0)>
16. <6, (1, 8, 7)>

Moving to node 7:
17. <7, (9, 8, 0)>

Proceeding to node 8:
18. <8, (4, 6, 1)>
19. <8, (4, 6, 3)>
20. <8, (4, 0, 1)>
21. <8, (2, 9, 3)>
22. <8, (2, 3, 7)>

Next is node 9:
23. <9, (5, 6, 0)>
24. <9, (6, 5, 0)>
25. <9, (6, 5, 2)>
26. <9, (6, 5, 7)>
27. <9, (6, 5, 0)>
28. <9, (0, 6, 4)>
29. <9, (0, 6, 7)>
30. <9, (0, 6, 2)>
31. <9, (0, 6, 5)>
32. <9, (2, 8, 0)>
33. <9, (2, 3, 7)>

Hence, there are a total of [33] 3-stars in the given graph.
