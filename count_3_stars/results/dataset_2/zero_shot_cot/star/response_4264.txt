Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 26) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 24) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 29) (14, 13) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 24) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 13) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 16) (25, 23) (26, 3) (26, 11) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 22) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 23) (10, 5) (21, 14) (21, 12) (21, 23) (21, 4) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 7) (28, 3) (28, 18) (28, 2) (18, 20) (18, 28) (18, 9) (4, 21) (4, 22) (4, 6) (22, 24) (22, 4) (12, 21) (16, 17) (16, 25) (9, 18) (9, 0) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 24) (0, 9) (0, 2) (29, 14) (29, 11) (7, 20) (7, 27) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (11, 26) (11, 27) (11, 29) (11, 6) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 21) (2, 15) (2, 28) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<7, (20, 25, 27)>
<16, (17, 25, 27)>
<12, (21, 29, 11)>
<14, (17, 13, 20)>
<18, (20, 28, 9)>
<20, (25, 27, 18)>
<21, (14, 12, 23)>
<22, (24, 4, 6)>
<24, (15, 1, 0)>
<25, (20, 16, 23)>
<26, (3, 11, 27)>
<28, (3, 18, 2)>
<29, (14, 11, 17)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars listed above, so the answer is: [13].
