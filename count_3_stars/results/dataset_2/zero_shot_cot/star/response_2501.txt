Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (9, 15) (9, 12) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 17) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that each have exactly three connections to other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 11, and 7: <8, (5, 11, 7)>
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 13, 10, and 0: <2, (13, 10, 0)>
- Node 18 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 19, and 15: <18, (4, 19, 15)>
- Node 15 can form a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 1: <15, (9, 2, 1)>
- Node 19 can form a 3-star with nodes 18, 7, and 6: <19, (18, 7, 6)>
- Node 10 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 18, and 16: <10, (2, 18, 16)>
- Node 14 can form a 3-star with nodes 11, 7, and 12: <14, (11, 7, 12)>
- Node 16 can form a 3-star with nodes 10, 17, and 14: <16, (10, 17, 14)>

Counting the identified 3-stars, we find the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
