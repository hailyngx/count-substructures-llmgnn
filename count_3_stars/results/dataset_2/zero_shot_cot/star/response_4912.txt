Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (15, 14) (15, 3) (15, 12) (13, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 15) (12, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 0) (6, 10) (6, 16) (0, 5) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (7, 5) (7, 14) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that are the center of a 3-star in the graph. Since each 3-star has a center connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we will look for nodes with degree 3.

Nodes with degree 3: 5, 9, 1, 3, 10, 14, 15, 6

Next, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star. We will list the unique 3-stars found:

<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<9, (5, 18, 17)>
<1, (3, 10, 8)>
<3, (1, 15, 8)>
<10, (1, 11, 6)>
<14, (11, 7, 15)>
<15, (14, 3, 12)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
