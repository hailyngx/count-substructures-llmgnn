Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first list all the nodes connected to three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, and 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 3. 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 1.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 8. <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 6, and 3. <4, (1, 6, 3)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 3, and 8. <7, (5, 3, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 3. <6, (5, 4, 3)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 1. <2, (9, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
