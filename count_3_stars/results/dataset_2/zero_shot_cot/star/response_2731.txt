Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (17, 29) (17, 21) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 14) (6, 18) (6, 29) (6, 21) (6, 14) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 19) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (26, 5) (24, 15) (24, 21) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 27) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 9) (1, 2) (1, 25) (15, 24) (15, 25) (8, 22) (8, 19) (8, 27) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 9) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (5, 26) (5, 10) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 12) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 20) (12, 28) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 20) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 11) (23, 25) (23, 10) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 16) (25, 23) (9, 21) (9, 19) (9, 14) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 2) (27, 20) (11, 13) (11, 20) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find nodes that meet the criteria for being the center of a 3-star:

1. Select a node as the center.
2. Check if this node has exactly three neighbors.

Let's list the steps we will take to solve this problem:

1. Identify nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.
2. For each of these nodes, check if its neighbors are connected to each other.

Now let's execute the steps above:

1. Nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors: 6, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 26, 28.

2. 
   - For node 6: (6, 18, 29), (6, 29, 21), (6, 21, 14)
   - For node 14: (14, 29, 6), (14, 6, 21), (14, 21, 9)
   - For node 15: (15, 24, 25), (15, 25, 16), (15, 16, 10)
   - For node 16: (16, 25, 15), (16, 15, 24), (16, 24, 0)
   - For node 17: (17, 29, 21), (17, 21, 6), (17, 6, 29)
   - For node 19: (19, 28, 8), (19, 8, 27), (19, 27, 20)
   - For node 20: (20, 27, 2), (20, 2, 1), (20, 1, 25)
   - For node 21: (21, 6, 14), (21, 14, 9), (21, 9, 19)
   - For node 23: (23, 25, 15), (23, 15, 16), (23, 16, 10)
   - For node 26: (26, 5, 10), (26, 10, 23), (26, 23, 25)
   - For node 28: (28, 22, 8), (28, 8, 19), (28, 19, 9)

<6, (18, 29, 21)>, <14, (29, 6, 21)>, <15, (24, 25, 16)>, <16, (25, 15, 24)>, <17, (29, 21, 6)>, <19, (28, 8, 27)>, <20, (27, 2, 1)>, <21, (6, 14, 9)>, <23, (25, 15, 16)>, <26, (5, 10, 23)>, <28, (22, 8, 19)>
