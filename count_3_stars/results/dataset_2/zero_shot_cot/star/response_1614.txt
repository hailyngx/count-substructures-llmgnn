Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 2, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 8)>
<13, (9, 12, 1)>
<1, (9, 13, 14)>
<6, (7, 14, 0)>
<12, (13, 1, 11)>
<3, (7, 2, 14)>
<14, (7, 1, 6)>
<10, (5, 13, 3)>
<0, (4, 8, 6)>
<11, (5, 8, 6)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the answer is [15].
