Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 10) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 15) (14, 1) (14, 19) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 18) (19, 4) (19, 14) (18, 7) (18, 15) (18, 5) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (12, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (10, 16) (10, 5) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 10) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to identify the 3-stars.

The central node in a 3-star graph will be connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 9, 15)>
<2, (6, 9, 13)>
<3, (1, 5, 12)>
<4, (7, 17, 19)>
<5, (3, 10, 18)>
<6, (2, 7, 17)>
<7, (4, 6, 18)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<10, (5, 10, 16)>
<11, (5, 15, 16)>
<15, (1, 11, 18)>
<16, (10, 11, 2)>
<17, (4, 6, 11)>
<18, (5, 7, 15)>
<19, (4, 14, 17)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique combinations listed above.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
