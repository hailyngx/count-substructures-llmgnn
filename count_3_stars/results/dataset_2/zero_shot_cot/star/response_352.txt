Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8) - forms a 3-star <5, (9, 2, 8)>.
2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3) - forms a 3-star <9, (5, 4, 3)>.
3. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 6) - forms a 3-star <4, (9, 8, 6)>.
4. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 6) - forms a 3-star <8, (5, 4, 6)>.
5. Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 1) - does not form a 3-star as it has 4 connections.
6. Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 8) - forms a 3-star <2, (5, 4, 8)>.
7. Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 2) - forms a 3-star <0, (9, 4, 2)>.
8. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 1) - does not form a 3-star as it has 2 connections.
9. Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 6) - forms a 3-star <1, (9, 4, 6)>.
10. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 0) - forms a 3-star <3, (5, 9, 0)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>, <4, (9, 8, 6)>, <8, (5, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 4, 8)>, <0, (9, 4, 2)>
