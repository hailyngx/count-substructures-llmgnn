Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (1, 11) (15, 7) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 12) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (16, 19) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 19) (6, 16) (6, 0) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 17) (2, 16) (12, 17) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 4: (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 0)
2. Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 10), (8, 3)
3. Node 13: (13, 17), (13, 19), (13, 0)
4. Node 17: (17, 13), (17, 12), (17, 2)
5. Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 18), (9, 14)
6. Node 19: (19, 13), (19, 16), (19, 6)
7. Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 10)
8. Node 16: (16, 19), (16, 2), (16, 6)
9. Node 6: (6, 19), (6, 16), (6, 0)
10. Node 7: (7, 15), (7, 17), (7, 10)
11. Node 3: (3, 8), (3, 18), (3, 12)
12. Node 10: (10, 8), (10, 5), (10, 7)
13. Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 5), (14, 12)
14. Node 2: (2, 17), (2, 16), (2, 13)
15. Node 12: (12, 17), (12, 9), (12, 19)

Thus, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<13, (17, 19, 0)>
<17, (13, 12, 2)>
<9, (4, 18, 14)>
<19, (13, 16, 6)>
<5, (4, 0, 10)>
<16, (19, 2, 6)>
<6, (19, 16, 0)>
<7, (15, 17, 10)>
<3, (8, 18, 12)>
<10, (8, 5, 7)>
<14, (9, 5, 12)>
<2, (17, 16, 13)>
<12, (17, 9, 19)>
