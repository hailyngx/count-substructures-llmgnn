Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 0:
- (0, 5, 3)
- (0, 4, 7)
- (0, 1, 9)

2. Node 1:
- (1, 9, 6)
- (1, 8, 2)
- (1, 0, 5)

3. Node 2:
- (2, 9, 6)
- (2, 4, 8)
- (2, 3, 7)

4. Node 3:
- (3, 5, 0)
- (3, 4, 7)
- (3, 2, 8)

5. Node 4:
- (4, 7, 0)
- (4, 2, 8)
- (4, 3, 7)

6. Node 5:
- (5, 6, 9)
- (5, 0, 3)
- (5, 1, 9)

7. Node 6:
- (6, 9, 5)
- (6, 1, 9)
- (6, 2, 9)

8. Node 7:
- (7, 9, 4)
- (7, 4, 0)
- (7, 3, 8)

9. Node 8:
- (8, 2, 4)
- (8, 1, 7)
- (8, 3, 2)

10. Node 9:
- (9, 6, 5)
- (9, 2, 6)
- (9, 1, 7)

There are 30 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is: [30]
