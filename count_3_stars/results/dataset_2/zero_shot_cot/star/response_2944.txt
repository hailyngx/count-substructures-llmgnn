Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
<1, (4, 0, -)>
<3, (7, 6, 9)>
<8, (-, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (3, 8, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>
<0, (1, 8, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
So, there are [10] 3-stars in this graph.
