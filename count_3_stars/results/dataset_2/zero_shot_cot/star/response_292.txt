Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, as these nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star graph.

Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 5 has 4 edges
- Node 9 has 5 edges
- Node 4 has 4 edges
- Node 7 has 1 edges
- Node 1 has 4 edges
- Node 3 has 5 edges
- Node 8 has 6 edges
- Node 6 has 3 edges
- Node 2 has 4 edges
- Node 0 has 4 edges

Next, let's consider each node as the potential center of a 3-star and check if the connections form a valid 3-star (center connected to exactly three other nodes).

For node 5:
- (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 4) form a 3-star <5, (9, 8, 4)>

For node 9:
- (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 4) form a 3-star <9, (5, 8, 4)>
- (9, 8), (9, 1), (9, 7) form a 3-star <9, (8, 1, 7)>
- (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 1) form a 3-star <9, (0, 4, 1)>

For node 4:
- (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 8) form a 3-star <4, (5, 9, 8)>
- (4, 0), (4, 9), (4, 8) form a 3-star <4, (0, 9, 8)>

For node 1:
- (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6) form a 3-star <1, (9, 3, 6)>

For node 3:
- (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 6) form a 3-star <3, (1, 0, 6)>

For node 8:
- (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4) form a 3-star <8, (5, 9, 4)>

For node 2:
- (2, 5), (2, 3), (2, 8) form a 3-star <2, (5, 3, 8)>

For node 0:
- (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 3) form a 3-star <0, (9, 4, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<5, (9, 8, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<9, (8, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 1)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (0, 9, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 0, 6)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 3, 8)>
<0, (9, 4, 3)>
