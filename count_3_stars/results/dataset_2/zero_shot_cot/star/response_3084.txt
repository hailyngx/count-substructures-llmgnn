Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 9) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 18) (0, 18) (0, 26) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 20) (2, 24) (1, 5) (1, 22) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 12) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 5) (28, 17) (28, 16) (28, 19) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 29) (23, 26) (23, 18) (23, 25) (23, 24) (23, 13) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 20) (26, 29) (22, 4) (22, 1) (22, 21) (7, 13) (19, 28) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 20) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 23) (18, 20) (20, 2) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 18) (20, 21) (29, 12) (29, 26) (21, 22) (21, 20) (21, 9) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 24) (13, 9) (25, 23) (9, 17) (9, 21) (9, 13) (9, 24) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (24, 2) (24, 23) (24, 13) (24, 9) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Since a 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly three edges. We can identify the nodes with degree 3 in the given graph:

- Node 11 has edges to nodes 14, 8, and 12.
- Node 12 has edges to nodes 11, 2, and 15.

2. Now, let's check if there are 3-stars centered at nodes 11 and 12:

3-stars centered at node 11:
<11, (14, 8, 12)>

3-stars centered at node 12:
<12, (11, 2, 15)>

Thus, there are two unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
