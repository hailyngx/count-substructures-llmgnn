Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the unique 3-star configurations in the graph.
Let's go through the list of edges and find the 3-stars:

1. Start with node 0:
   - (0, 1, 3)
   - (0, 4, 9)

2. Move to node 2:
   - (2, 3, 6)
   - (2, 4, 10)

3. Next is node 4:
   - (4, 7, 14)
   - (4, 8, 12)

4. Proceed to node 6:
   - (6, 10, 13)

5. Move to node 8:
   - (8, 1, 10)

6. Next is node 9:
   - (9, 5, 11)

7. Finally, check node 13:
   - (13, 0, 6)

Count of unique 3-stars: 7
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, 1, 3>, <0, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 6>, <2, 4, 10>, <4, 7, 14>, <4, 8, 12>, <6, 10, 13>.
