Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 28) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (6, 11) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 13) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 20) (22, 8) (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (0, 26) (20, 18) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 13) (12, 15) (12, 20) (12, 19) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 24) (8, 5) (8, 22) (8, 2) (8, 4) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 23) (4, 18) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 1) (26, 0) (26, 23) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 10) (29, 5) (29, 15) (29, 20) (23, 11) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 26) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 28) (17, 9) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 3) (25, 17) (25, 1) (24, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 19) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 13) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 3) (13, 19) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, making them the centers of 3-stars. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (16, 8, 29)>
<12, (15, 20, 19)>
<4, (18, 27, 1)>
<1, (9, 7, 14)>
<27, (15, 4, 23)>
<8, (5, 2, 22)>
<13, (21, 20, 3)>
<2, (7, 8, 24)>
<29, (5, 15, 20)>
<9, (6, 17, 1)>
<15, (12, 27, 29)>
<18, (4, 10, 20)>
<7, (2, 1, 14)>
<21, (13, 10, 3)>
<16, (28, 5, 17)>
<3, (5, 17, 13)>
<26, (0, 23, 26)>
<17, (28, 25, 3)>
<10, (21, 18, 28)>
<25, (17, 1, 25)>
<24, (2, 8, 24)>
<0, (26, 23, 0)>

There are 22 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So the answer is [22].
