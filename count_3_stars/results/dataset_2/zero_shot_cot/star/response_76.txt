Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5)
