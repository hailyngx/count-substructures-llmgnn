Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 14) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Calculating the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 6
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 5
- Node 10: degree 5
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 6
- Node 14: degree 3

Identifying the 3-stars:
- From the degrees calculated above, we can see that nodes 4 and 13 are connected to exactly three other nodes, making them centers of the 3-stars.
- For node 4, the 3-stars are <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, and <4, (7, 8, 13)>.
- For node 13, the 3-stars are <13, (7, 10, 11)>, <13, (8, 10, 12)>, and <13, (12, 14, 8)>.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we find that there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
