Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (6, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 12) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 3, 13)>
<2, (1, 3, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (10, 9, 14)>
<9, (6, 10, 12)>
<11, (1, 10, 14)>
