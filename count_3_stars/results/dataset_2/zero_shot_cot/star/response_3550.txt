Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (12, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can think about each node as a potential center of a 3-star and count the number of 3-stars around it.

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars:

<0, (9, 8, 4)>
<1, (5, 3, 13)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 13)>
<4, (5, 9, 11)>
<5, (1, 6, 11)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 8, 13)>
<8, (9, 2, 14)>
<9, (4, 0, 10)>
<10, (9)>
<11, (13, 6, 14)>
<12, (14)>
<13, (1, 3, 8)>
<14, (9, 11, 12)>

Total number of 3-stars: [14]
