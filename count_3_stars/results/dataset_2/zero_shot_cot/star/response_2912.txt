Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (15, 2) (15, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 1) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 11) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <1, (6, 9, 17)>
2. <2, (18, 4, 15)>
3. <4, (2, 8, 5)>
4. <5, (4, 19, 12)>
5. <8, (4, 16, 12)>
6. <9, (6, 17, 14)>
7. <11, (18, 17, 14)>
8. <12, (8, 5, 11)>
9. <15, (2, 1, 1)>
10. <16, (8, 1, 1)>
11. <17, (9, 1, 11)>
12. <18, (2, 11, 11)>
13. <19, (5, 0, 13)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [13].
