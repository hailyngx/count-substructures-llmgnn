Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 19) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 10) (3, 15) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 16) (15, 19) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 20) (2, 7) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 16) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 16) (25, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (21, 6) (21, 26) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 18) (18, 2) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 11) (0, 7) (0, 20) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 12) (28, 17) (28, 9) (28, 24) (9, 3) (9, 28) (6, 21) (6, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 1) (16, 22) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 5) (1, 19) (1, 24) (27, 25) (27, 17) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 27) (26, 21) (24, 8) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 1) (10, 22) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 10) (12, 25) (12, 20) (12, 6) (12, 11) (23, 3) (23, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of four nodes where one node is directly connected to the other three nodes, forming a 3-star configuration.

The nodes involved in the 3-stars are (2, 7, 0): <2, (7, 0, 20)>, <7, (2, 0, 20)>, <0, (7, 2, 20)>,
(13, 29, 2): <13, (29, 2, 20)>, <29, (13, 2, 16)>, <2, (13, 29, 18)>,
(13, 20, 0): <13, (20, 0, 19)>, <20, (13, 0, 2)>, <0, (13, 20, 12)>,
(25, 27, 17): <25, (27, 17, 16)>, <27, (25, 17, 28)>, <17, (25, 27, 28)>,
(15, 19, 4): <15, (19, 4, 16)>, <19, (15, 4, 1)>, <4, (15, 19, 14)>,
(25, 17, 28): <25, (17, 28, 27)>, <17, (25, 28, 27)>, <28, (25, 17, 24)>,
(3, 15, 16): <3, (15, 16, 9)>, <15, (3, 16, 19)>, <16, (3, 15, 25)>,
(14, 4, 10): <14, (4, 10, 22)>, <4, (14, 10, 19)>, <10, (14, 4, 23)>,
(8, 18, 10): <8, (18, 10, 24)>, <18, (8, 10, 11)>, <10, (8, 18, 23)>,
(6, 12, 21): <6, (12, 21, 26)>, <12, (6, 21, 25)>, <21, (6, 12, 26)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
