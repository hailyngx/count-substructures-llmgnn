Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star in the graph.

1. Central node 4: (4, 7), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 2)
2. Central node 7: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 10), (7, 9), (7, 8)
3. Central node 8: Not connected to exactly three other nodes.
4. Central node 13: (13, 12), (13, 2), (13, 11), (13, 3)
5. Central node 5: (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 10)
6. Central node 6: Not connected to exactly three other nodes.
7. Central node 2: (2, 4), (2, 13), (2, 9), (2, 10)
8. Central node 9: (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 11), (9, 14), (9, 12)
9. Central node 1: (1, 6), (1, 14), (1, 10)
10. Central node 0: Not connected to exactly three other nodes.
11. Central node 10: (10, 7), (10, 5), (10, 2), (10, 1), (10, 0)
12. Central node 11: (11, 13), (11, 9), (11, 12)
13. Central node 14: (14, 6), (14, 9), (14, 1), (14, 12)
14. Central node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 13), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 0)
15. Central node 12: (12, 13), (12, 9), (12, 11), (12, 14)

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (7, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 3, 10)>
<5, (4, 0, 3)>
<2, (4, 13, 9)>
<2, (13, 9, 10)>
<9, (7, 8, 11)>
<9, (2, 11, 12)>
<10, (7, 5, 2)>
<10, (1, 0, 7)>
<3, (4, 7, 13)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<12, (13, 11, 14)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
