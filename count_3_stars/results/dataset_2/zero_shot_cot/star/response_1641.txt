Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (17, 5) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 11) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 10) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 0) (12, 15) (12, 0) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 19) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node to find 3-stars. Based on the given edges, the connections are as follows:

1: 15, 18
2: 6, 8, 13
3: 9, 13, 19, 4
4: 3, 5, 11
5: 8, 17, 4, 18, 11
6: 9, 2
7: 8, 17, 10
8: 2, 5, 7
9: 6, 3, 19
10: 15, 7, 13
11: 15, 4, 5, 12
12: 15, 0, 11
13: 3, 2, 10, 19
15: 1, 10, 0, 12, 11
16: 19
17: 5, 7
18: 1, 5, 0
19: 9, 3, 13, 16

Now, let's find the 3-stars present in the graph:
<3, (9, 13, 19)>
<4, (3, 5, 11)>
<5, (8, 17, 18)>
<7, (8, 17, 10)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<10, (15, 7, 13)>
<11, (15, 5, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
