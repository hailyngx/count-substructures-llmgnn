Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 2) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 5) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (18, 13) (2, 15) (2, 8) (5, 17) (5, 11) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 19) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 9) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 16) (6, 10) (6, 17) (6, 4) (6, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

The nodes with degree 3 are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17

Next, we will check each of these nodes to see if they are the center of a 3-star. 

1. Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 17), (0, 11) - forms a 3-star with center 0
2. Node 1: (1, 8), (1, 12), (1, 0) - forms a 3-star with center 1
3. Node 2: (2, 15), (2, 8) - does not form a 3-star
4. Node 4: (4, 12), (4, 19), (4, 6) - forms a 3-star with center 4
5. Node 5: (5, 17), (5, 11) - does not form a 3-star
6. Node 6: (6, 10), (6, 17), (6, 4) - forms a 3-star with center 6
7. Node 8: (8, 10), (8, 2), (8, 14), (8, 1) - does not form a 3-star
8. Node 9: (9, 15), (9, 11), (9, 16) - forms a 3-star with center 9
9. Node 10: (10, 17), (10, 6), (10, 8) - forms a 3-star with center 10
10. Node 11: (11, 3), (11, 5), (11, 0) - forms a 3-star with center 11
11. Node 12: (12, 4), (12, 7), (12, 16), (12, 1) - does not form a 3-star
12. Node 13: (13, 15), (13, 18), (13, 19) - forms a 3-star with center 13
13. Node 14: (14, 3), (14, 8) - does not form a 3-star
14. Node 15: (15, 9), (15, 13), (15, 2) - forms a 3-star with center 15
15. Node 16: (16, 7), (16, 12), (16, 9) - forms a 3-star with center 16
16. Node 17: (17, 10), (17, 6), (17, 0), (17, 5) - does not form a 3-star

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 17, 11)>, <1, (8, 12, 0)>, <4, (12, 19, 6)>, <9, (15, 11, 16)>, <10, (6, 17, 8)>, <11, (3, 5, 0)>, <13, (15, 18, 19)>, <15, (9, 13, 2)>, <16, (7, 12, 9)>
There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
