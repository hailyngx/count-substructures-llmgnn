Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (7, 19) (7, 5) (12, 15) (12, 1) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 1) (1, 12) (1, 8) (9, 10) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 18) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 18) (11, 17) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 13) (17, 16) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 4) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (4, 10) (4, 17) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (5, 17) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, we will identify all nodes which have exactly 3 incident edges, as these are potential center nodes for 3-stars.

1. Nodes with 3 incident edges:
- Node 1 = {(12, 8), (1, 12), (8, 1)}
- Node 2 = {(3, 2), (2, 3), (15, 2), (2, 15)}
- Node 5 = {(3, 5), (7, 5), (16, 5), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 16), (17, 5), (5, 17)}
- Node 6 = {(17, 6), (6, 17), (18, 6), (6, 18), (19, 6), (6, 19), (13, 6), (6, 13)}
- Node 10 = {(9, 10), (10, 9), (0, 10), (10, 0), (10, 4), (4, 10), (10, 13), (13, 10), (10, 14), (14, 10)}
- Node 12 = {(15, 12), (12, 15), (1, 12), (12, 1)}
- Node 13 = {(10, 13), (13, 10), (6, 13), (13, 6), (19, 13), (13, 19), (18, 13), (13, 18)}
- Node 14 = {(16, 14), (14, 16), (10, 14), (14, 10), (19, 14), (14, 19)}
- Node 15 = {(15, 12), (12, 15), (15, 2), (2, 15)}
- Node 16 = {(0, 16), (16, 0), (16, 17), (17, 16), (16, 14), (14, 16), (16, 5), (5, 16)}
- Node 17 = {(16, 17), (17, 16), (11, 17), (17, 11), (6, 17), (17, 6), (17, 5), (5, 17), (17, 4), (4, 17)}
- Node 18 = {(0, 18), (18, 0), (11, 18), (18, 11), (6, 18), (18, 6), (18, 13), (13, 18)}
- Node 19 = {(3, 19), (19, 3), (7, 19), (19, 7), (6, 19), (19, 6), (14, 19), (19, 14), (13, 19), (19, 13)}

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars in the graph. We observe the following 3-stars:
- Node 2: <2, (3, 15, 5)>
- Node 5: <5, (3, 7, 16)>
- Node 17: <17, (16, 11, 6)>
- Node 10: <10, (9, 0, 4)>
- Node 19: <19, (3, 7, 6)>
- Node 13: <13, (10, 6, 19)>
- Node 18: <18, (0, 11, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
