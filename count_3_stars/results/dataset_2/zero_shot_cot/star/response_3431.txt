Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 13) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (10, 13, 3)>
<1, (9, 7, 6)>
<2, (8, 12, 14)>
<3, (8, 13, 14)>
<4, (5, 10, 11)>
<5, (4, 9, 11)>
<6, (1, 7, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 0)>
<8, (2, 8, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 12)>
<10, (0, 11, 13)>
<11, (4, 5, 10)>
<12, (4, 9, 7)>
<13, (0, 1, 14)>
<14, (2, 3, 13)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is [14].
