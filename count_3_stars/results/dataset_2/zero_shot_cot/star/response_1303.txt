Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 2) (16, 17) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 19) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 18) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 17) (1, 8) (1, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of each 3-star. 
Based on the given edges, the nodes with exactly 3 incident edges are: 4, 8, 12, 15, and 19.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (8, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 1, 18)>
<12, (7, 17, 18)>
<15, (7, 14, 19)>
<19, (6, 7, 3)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph we found, we get a total of [5].
