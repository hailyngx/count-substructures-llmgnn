Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 19) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 25) (21, 15) (18, 22) (18, 9) (18, 20) (18, 29) (22, 18) (0, 23) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 26) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 25) (29, 18) (29, 9) (29, 8) (6, 17) (28, 7) (28, 23) (9, 18) (9, 29) (9, 23) (26, 14) (26, 27) (26, 15) (26, 20) (5, 13) (5, 24) (5, 15) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 5) (3, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 19) (11, 17) (11, 23) (11, 20) (11, 25) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 9) (23, 11) (16, 8) (16, 4) (10, 21) (10, 5) (10, 2) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 2) (24, 27) (24, 5) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 25) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 11) (8, 29) (8, 16) (4, 14) (4, 16) (25, 21) (25, 12) (25, 11) (25, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their neighbors (leaves) based on the given edges:

1. Central node 14: Neighbors 17, 26, 19, 4
2. Central node 17: Neighbors 14, 1, 6, 11
3. Central node 7: Neighbors 21, 15, 28, 1
4. Central node 21: Neighbors 7, 10, 25, 15
5. Central node 18: Neighbors 22, 9, 20, 29
6. Central node 22: Neighbor 18
7. Central node 27: Neighbors 12, 24, 26
8. Central node 12: Neighbors 27, 13, 25
9. Central node 29: Neighbors 18, 9, 8
10. Central node 6: Neighbor 17
11. Central node 28: Neighbors 7, 23
12. Central node 9: Neighbors 18, 29, 23
13. Central node 26: Neighbors 14, 27, 15, 20
14. Central node 5: Neighbors 13, 24, 15, 10
15. Central node 13: Neighbors 12, 5
16. Central node 3: Neighbor 2
17. Central node 1: Neighbors 17, 7, 2, 19
18. Central node 11: Neighbors 17, 23, 20, 25
19. Central node 23: Neighbors 0, 28, 9, 11
20. Central node 16: Neighbors 8, 4
21. Central node 10: Neighbors 21, 5, 2
22. Central node 19: Neighbors 14, 1, 2
23. Central node 24: Neighbors 27, 5
24. Central node 15: Neighbors 7, 21, 26, 5
25. Central node 2: Neighbors 3, 1, 10, 19, 25

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

[19] <14, (17, 26, 19)>
<17, (14, 1, 6)>
<7, (21, 15, 28)>
<21, (7, 10, 25)>
<18, (22, 9, 20)>
<27, (12, 24, 26)>
<12, (27, 13, 25)>
<18, (22, 9, 29)>
<26, (14, 27, 15)>
<5, (13, 24, 15)>
<13, (12, 5, 15)>
<4, (16, 8, 20)>
<18, (22, 9, 29)>
<26, (14, 27, 15)>
<5, (13, 24, 15)>
<3, (2, 1, 10)>
<1, (17, 7, 2)>
<9, (18, 29, 23)>
<25, (2, 1, 10)>
