Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 21) (2, 29) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 24) (29, 3) (8, 29) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 6) (24, 29) (24, 3) (26, 12) (26, 4) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 11) (16, 22) (16, 25) (16, 27) (21, 17) (21, 9) (21, 22) (4, 14) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 22) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 4) (22, 5) (11, 15) (0, 1) (0, 28) (3, 29) (3, 24) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 23) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 20) (7, 20) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (20, 2) (20, 28) (20, 7) (20, 19) (19, 7) (19, 20) (19, 25) (25, 16) (25, 19) (25, 5) (9, 1) (9, 21) (18, 7) (18, 27) (27, 13) (27, 16) (27, 28) (27, 18) (5, 22) (5, 25) (5, 10) (23, 6) (12, 8) (12, 26) (12, 28) (10, 28) (10, 7) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected in a 3-star pattern. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 16: (16, 22), (16, 25), (16, 27)
   - Node 18: (18, 7), (18, 27), (18, 28)
   - Node 23: (23, 6)

2. From the nodes identified in step 1, list out the unique 3-stars:
   - <16, (22, 25, 27)>
   - <18, (7, 27, 28)>
   - <23, (6)>

After listing out all the unique 3-stars, we count and find that there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
