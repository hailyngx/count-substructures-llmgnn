Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 19) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 3) (4, 19) (8, 12) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 16) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 14) (18, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 15) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 2) (15, 9) (15, 19) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 6: <6, (1, 9, 14)>
- Node 9: <9, (0, 6, 15)>
- Node 1: <1, (5, 6, -)>
- Node 3: No 3-star (only connected to 4 and 7)
- Node 10: No 3-star (only connected to 3 and 17)
- Node 17: <17, (7, 10, 5)>
- Node 4: No 3-star (only connected to 3 and 19)
- Node 8: No 3-star (only connected to 7 and 12)
- Node 7: <7, (3, 11, 17)>
- Node 12: <12, (0, 7, 17)>
- Node 0: <0, (9, 12, 13)>
- Node 14: <14, (6, 16, 18)>
- Node 2: <2, (11, 13, 16)>
- Node 18: No 3-star (only connected to 2 and 14)
- Node 5: No 3-star (only connected to 1 and 17)
- Node 19: No 3-star (only connected to 10 and 15)
- Node 11: No 3-star (only connected to 6, 2, and 7)
- Node 15: No 3-star (only connected to 9 and 19)
- Node 13: No 3-star (only connected to 9, 7, and 2)
- Node 16: No 3-star (only connected to 14 and 2)

There are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
