Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node of each potential 3-star. We'll check each node in the graph to see if it connects to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, the central nodes and their connected nodes are as follows:

- Central Node 0: Connected to nodes 8, 11, 7, 12, 6, 9 (6 connections)
- Central Node 2: Connected to nodes 10, 3, 14, 1, 4 (5 connections)
- Central Node 3: Connected to nodes 7, 6, 4, 2 (4 connections)
- Central Node 14: Connected to nodes 11, 9, 12, 2, 5 (5 connections)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars present in the graph are:

<0, (8, 11, 7)>
<0, (8, 11, 12)>
<0, (8, 7, 6)>
<0, (11, 7, 12)>
<0, (11, 7, 9)>
<2, (10, 3, 14)>
<2, (10, 3, 1)>
<2, (10, 14, 1)>
<2, (3, 14, 1)>
<3, (7, 6, 4)>
<14, (11, 9, 12)>
<14, (11, 9, 2)>
<14, (11, 12, 2)>
<14, (9, 12, 2)>
<14, (9, 12, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
