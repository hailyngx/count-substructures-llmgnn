Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 24) (1, 12) (21, 23) (21, 14) (6, 9) (6, 26) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 24) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 20) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 7) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 14) (25, 3) (25, 14) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 29) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 17) (2, 22) (18, 5) (18, 28) (19, 29) (19, 7) (19, 14) (26, 6) (26, 23) (26, 16) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 15) (28, 18) (28, 11) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 29) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 5) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 11) (22, 15) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 5) (23, 16) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 19) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 19) (29, 10) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 23) (5, 17) (14, 21) (14, 3) (14, 25) (14, 19) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 17) (17, 4) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 16) (20, 8) (20, 24) (24, 1) (24, 9) (24, 13) (24, 20) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 1: (1, 29), (1, 24), (1, 12) -> <1, (29, 24, 12)>
2. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 26), (6, 16) -> <6, (9, 26, 16)>
3. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 24) -> <9, (6, 8, 24)>
4. Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 13), (8, 4) -> <8, (9, 13, 4)>
5. Node 13: (13, 8), (13, 16), (13, 24) -> <13, (8, 16, 24)>
6. Node 3: (3, 25), (3, 7), (3, 14) -> <3, (25, 7, 14)>
7. Node 25: (25, 3), (25, 14) -> No 3-star, as it has only two edges.
8. Node 12: (12, 1), (12, 10), (12, 29) -> <12, (1, 10, 29)>
9. Node 4: (4, 8), (4, 22), (4, 17) -> <4, (8, 22, 17)>
10. Node 22: (22, 4), (22, 2), (22, 11) -> <22, (4, 2, 11)>
11. Node 28: (28, 18), (28, 11) -> No 3-star, as it has only two edges.
12. Node 19: (19, 29), (19, 7), (19, 14) -> <19, (29, 7, 14)>
13. Node 26: (26, 6), (26, 23), (26, 16) -> <26, (6, 23, 16)>
14. Node 11: (11, 28), (11, 22), (11, 17) -> <11, (28, 22, 17)>
15. Node 10: (10, 12), (10, 15), (10, 29) -> <10, (12, 15, 29)>
16. Node 15: (15, 11), (15, 10), (15, 22) -> <15, (11, 10, 22)>
17. Node 23: (23, 21), (23, 26), (23, 5) -> <23, (21, 26, 5)>
18. Node 7: (7, 13), (7, 3), (7, 19) -> <7, (13, 3, 19)>
19. Node 5: (5, 18), (5, 15), (5, 23) -> <5, (18, 15, 23)>
20. Node 14: (14, 21), (14, 3), (14, 25), (14, 19) -> <14, (21, 3, 25, 19)>
21. Node 16: (16, 6), (16, 13), (16, 26), (16, 23), (16, 17) -> <16, (6, 13, 26, 23)>
22. Node 17: (17, 4), (17, 11), (17, 5), (17, 16) -> <17, (4, 11, 5, 16)>
23. Node 20: (20, 8), (20, 24) -> No 3-star, as it has only two edges.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
