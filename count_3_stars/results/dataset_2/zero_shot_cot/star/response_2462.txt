Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

From the provided edges, we can determine the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 10, 8)>
<9, (6, 11, 10)>
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<8, (6, 1, 13)>
<13, (6, 8, 5)>
<4, (3, 7, 5)>
<7, (9, 3, 4)>
<10, (6, 9, 11)>
<11, (9, 1, 10)>
<2, (1, 5, 2)>
<0, (6, 1, 7)>
<14, (8, 7, 5)>
<5, (3, 13, 4)>
<12, (10, 11, 12)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
