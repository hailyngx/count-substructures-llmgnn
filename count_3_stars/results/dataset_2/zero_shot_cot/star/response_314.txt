Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by finding nodes that are connected in the required configuration.

Let's find the 3-stars:

1. Node 4 can form a 3-star with 3 of its neighbors: Node 1, Node 3, and Node 8.  
   <4, (1, 3, 8)>
   
2. Node 7 can form a 3-star with 3 of its neighbors: Node 1, Node 10, and Node 13.  
   <7, (1, 10, 13)>
   
3. Node 8 can form a 3-star with 3 of its neighbors: Node 3, Node 4, and Node 9.  
   <8, (3, 4, 9)>
   
4. Node 5 can form a 3-star with 3 of its neighbors: Node 1, Node 3, and Node 13.  
   <5, (1, 3, 13)>
   
5. Node 13 can form a 3-star with 3 of its neighbors: Node 3, Node 5, and Node 7.  
   <13, (3, 5, 7)>
   
6. Node 9 can form a 3-star with 3 of its neighbors: Node 2, Node 8, and Node 12.  
   <9, (2, 8, 12)>
   
7. Node 12 can form a 3-star with 3 of its neighbors: Node 9, Node 11, and Node 14.  
   <12, (9, 11, 14)>
   
8. Node 11 can form a 3-star with 3 of its neighbors: Node 12, Node 13, and Node 14.  
   <11, (12, 13, 14)>
   
9. Node 14 can form a 3-star with 3 of its neighbors: Node 1, Node 10, and Node 11.  
   <14, (1, 10, 11)>
   
[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9.]
