Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 10) (5, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (15, 19) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 14) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes since those nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 0 (connected to 1, 4, 6)
- Node 2 (connected to 1, 7, 12)
- Node 3 (connected to 5, 8, 12)
- Node 9 (connected to 1, 12, 14)
- Node 13 (connected to 0, 17, 6)
- Node 15 (connected to 19, 18, not seen)
- Node 14 (connected to 2, 8, 9)

Since node 15 has an edge not listed, we don't have enough information to determine if it could be a center of a 3-star. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are 6 potential centers of 3-stars found above, and for each center, there are exactly three possible 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 8, 13)>, <0, (4, 8, 6)>
- Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 14)>, <2, (7, 12, 14)>, <2, (1, 12, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (5, 8, 12)>, <3, (5, 18, 12)>, <3, (8, 12, 9)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 12, 14)>, <9, (1, 9, 14)>, <9, (12, 2, 14)>
- Node 13: <13, (0, 17, 6)>, <13, (0, 17, 13)>, <13, (17, 18, 6)>
- Node 14: <14, (2, 8, 9)>, <14, (2, 9, 12)>, <14, (8, 9, 12)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
