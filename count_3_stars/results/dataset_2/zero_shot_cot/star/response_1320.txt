Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-star graphs. These central nodes must have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

From the given edges, we find the central nodes with 3 edges:
Node 5 has 4 edges connected to it (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3)
Node 9 has 4 edges connected to it (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3)
Node 4 has 4 edges connected to it (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 2)
Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 6)
Node 6 has 3 edges connected to it (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 8)
Node 8 has 4 edges connected to it (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 1)
Node 2 has 5 edges connected to it (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 1)
Node 0 has 3 edges connected to it (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 1)
Node 3 has 4 edges connected to it (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7)
Node 1 has 5 edges connected to it (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 2), (1, 0)

Next, for each central node found, let's list the 3-stars it is a part of:
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 2, 0)>
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 4, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of [10] 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [10].
