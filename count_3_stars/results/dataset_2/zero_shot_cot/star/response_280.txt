Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 17) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 13) (14, 21) (17, 27) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 23) (2, 15) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 5) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 27) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 23) (28, 6) (28, 7) (28, 20) (20, 28) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 4) (6, 28) (9, 18) (9, 19) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 24) (4, 27) (4, 20) (4, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (26, 4) (26, 18) (26, 0) (5, 29) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 5) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 25) (23, 17) (23, 10) (23, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 24) (24, 22) (24, 16) (25, 11) (25, 8) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 21) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 28) (7, 5) (7, 8) (12, 10) (0, 29) (0, 26) (0, 11) (13, 14) (13, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes and their neighbors. Then, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

Center nodes:
- Node 1: Neighbors 3, 10, 11, 16, 7
- Node 2: Neighbors 15, 29
- Node 3: Neighbors 27, 1, 16
- Node 4: Neighbors 27, 20, 26
- Node 5: Neighbors 29, 19, 7
- Node 6: Neighbors 28
- Node 8: Neighbors 14, 25, 21, 7
- Node 9: Neighbors 18, 19
- Node 13: Neighbors 14, 20
- Node 14: Neighbors 17, 8, 22, 13, 21
- Node 15: Neighbors 27, 19, 2
- Node 17: Neighbors 27, 14, 10, 23
- Node 18: Neighbors 9, 26
- Node 20: Neighbors 28, 22, 4, 13, 21
- Node 22: Neighbors 14, 20, 24, 22
- Node 25: Neighbors 8, 11
- Node 26: Neighbors 4, 18, 0
- Node 27: Neighbors 15, 3, 17, 4
- Node 28: Neighbors 6, 7, 20
- Node 29: Neighbors 2, 5, 0

Now we can count the number of 3-stars:
<1, (3, 10, 16)>
<1, (3, 7, 16)>
<1, (10, 7, 11)>
<1, (10, 7, 16)>
<1, (11, 7, 16)>
<2, (15, 19, 29)>
<2, (15, 2, 29)>
<3, (27, 17, 4)>
<3, (27, 17, 14)>
<3, (27, 14, 4)>
<4, (27, 20, 26)>
<5, (29, 19, 5)>
<5, (29, 19, 7)>
<5, (29, 5, 0)>
<14, (14, 21, 8)>
<14, (14, 21, 13)>
<14, (14, 13, 20)>
<14, (14, 21, 8)>
<14, (14, 21, 8)>
<20, (20, 21, 14)>
<20, (20, 21, 8)>
<20, (20, 21, 13)>
<20, (20, 21, 14)>
<22, (22, 24, 20)>
<22, (22, 24, 16)>
<22, (22, 24, 22)>
<22, (22, 24, 16)>
<22, (22, 24, 16)>
<26, (26, 18, 0)>
