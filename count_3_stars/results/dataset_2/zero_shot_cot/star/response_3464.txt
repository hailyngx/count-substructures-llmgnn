Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 1) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 5) (19, 10) (19, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) (2, 15) (2, 6) (18, 8) (18, 3) (5, 17) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 

1. Node 1: (1, 13, 19)
2. Node 2: (2, 6, 15)
3. Node 3: (3, 5, 18)
4. Node 4: (4, 6, 7), (4, 6, 13), (4, 6, 17)
5. Node 5: (5, 11, 14), (5, 11, 17), (5, 14, 17)
6. Node 6: (6, 2, 4)
7. Node 7: (7, 4, 9)
8. Node 8: (8, 7, 18)
9. Node 9: (9, 7, 15), (9, 15, 16)
10. Node 10: (10, 1, 12), (10, 1, 19), (10, 12, 14)
11. Node 11: (11, 0, 14), (11, 5, 14)
12. Node 12: (12, 1, 10)
13. Node 13: (13, 1, 17)
14. Node 14: (14, 5, 11)
15. Node 15: (15, 2, 6), (15, 9, 16)
16. Node 16: (16, 9, 15)
17. Node 17: (17, 4, 13), (17, 5, 11), (17, 5, 14)
18. Node 18: (18, 3, 8)
19. Node 19: (19, 1, 10)

Therefore, there are a total of 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is: [19]
