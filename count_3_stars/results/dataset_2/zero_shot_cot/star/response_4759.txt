Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as they can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 
The nodes with degree 3 are: 4, 9, 8, 5, 2, 1, and 3.

Now, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star. 
Starting with node 4: 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9. 
- So, the 3-star centered at node 4 is <4, (7, 8, 9)>.

Moving on to node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 0. 
- So, the 3-star centered at node 9 is <9, (4, 2, 0)>.

Next, node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 1, but it doesn't make a valid 3-star since nodes 5 and 1 are already connected to other nodes.

Moving on to node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8. 
- So, the 3-star centered at node 5 is <5, (4, 6, 8)>.

Next, node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9. Since node 9 is already part of a 3-star, this doesn't form a new 3-star.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 8, but they are already part of other 3-stars.

Finally, node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9. Since node 9 is already part of a 3-star, this doesn't form a new 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The 3-stars found are: <<4, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>>.
