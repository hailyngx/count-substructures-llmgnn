Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

Start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, 5, 1, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 3, 1, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 0, and 9.

Now, let's enumerate the 3-stars in the graph:

- <4, (7, 5, 1)>
- <4, (7, 5, 2)>
- <4, (7, 2, 6)>
- <4, (7, 2, 1)>
- <4, (8, 3, 9)>
- <4, (8, 3, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 3)>
- <4, (5, 6, 1)>
- <4, (5, 3, 9)>
- <4, (1, 6, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
