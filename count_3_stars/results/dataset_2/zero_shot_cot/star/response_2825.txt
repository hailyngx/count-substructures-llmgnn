Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
In order to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify those 3-stars step by step.

1. Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 5 is connected to 5, 6, 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to 5, 8, 2, and 3.
- Node 4 is connected to 5, 7, 0, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to 5, 4, 3, 6, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to 5, 7, 3, 0, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to 9, 4, 7, and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to 9, 1, 2, and 6.

2. Counting the 3-stars:
- From the identified nodes above, only nodes 5, 4, and 7 meet the criteria of being the center of a 3-star as they each have exactly three edges connected to them.

3. Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<4, (7, 0, 3)>
<7, (6, 1, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <4, (7, 0, 3)>, and <7, (6, 1, 5)>.
