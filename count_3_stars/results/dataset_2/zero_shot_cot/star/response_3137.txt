Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 1) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (3, 8) (3, 9) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 17) (4, 1) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 16) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 17) (14, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star, which consists of a central node and three leaves.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (7, 10, 11)>
<1, (12, 16, 4)>
<2, (7, 8, 5)>
<3, (8, 13, 9)>
<5, (7, 12, 15)>
<6, (7, 8, 13)>
<9, (11, 17, 3)>
<16, (1, 12, 15)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
