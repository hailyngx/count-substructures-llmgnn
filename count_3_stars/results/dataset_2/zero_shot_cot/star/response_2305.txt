Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 20) (1, 23) (1, 12) (1, 6) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 25) (4, 22) (7, 29) (7, 14) (7, 27) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 23) (15, 3) (15, 23) (15, 9) (15, 28) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 28) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 8) (29, 7) (19, 22) (19, 17) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 2) (26, 27) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 28) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 27) (2, 26) (2, 8) (2, 10) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (11, 14) (11, 5) (9, 21) (9, 15) (9, 8) (16, 22) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 24) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 18) (27, 7) (27, 26) (27, 14) (24, 16) (24, 5) (23, 1) (23, 3) (23, 15) (5, 11) (5, 24) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 0) (18, 21) (18, 25) (18, 6) (12, 13) (12, 1) (6, 1) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing the 3-stars one by one:
- Node 1: (1, 23), (1, 12), (1, 6) <1, (23, 12, 6)>
- Node 2: (2, 26), (2, 8), (2, 10) <2, (26, 8, 10)>
- Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 17), (3, 23) <3, (15, 17, 23)>
- Node 4: (4, 22) <4, (22, 19, 16)>
- Node 5: (5, 11), (5, 24) <5, (11, 24, 5)>
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 20), (6, 25), (6, 18), (6, 10) <6, (1, 20, 25)>
- Node 7: (7, 29), (7, 14), (7, 27) <7, (29, 14, 27)>
- Node 8: (8, 17), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 16) <8, (17, 2, 9)>
- Node 9: (9, 21), (9, 15), (9, 8) <9, (21, 15, 8)>
- Node 10: (10, 2), (10, 6) <10, (2, 6, 10)>
- Node 11: (11, 14), (11, 5) <11, (14, 5, 11)>
- Node 12: (12, 13), (12, 1) <12, (13, 1, 6)>
- Node 13: (13, 22), (13, 12), (13, 14) <13, (22, 12, 14)>
- Node 14: (14, 13), (14, 7), (14, 0), (14, 11), (14, 27) <14, (13, 7, 0)>
- Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 23), (15, 9), (15, 28) <15, (3, 23, 9)>
- Node 16: (16, 22), (16, 0), (16, 8), (16, 24) <16, (22, 0, 8)>
- Node 17: (17, 3), (17, 19), (17, 8) <17, (3, 19, 8)>
- Node 18: (18, 21), (18, 25), (18, 6) <18, (21, 25, 6)>
- Node 19: (19, 22), (19, 17), (19, 26) <19, (22, 17, 26)>
- Node 20: (20, 22), (20, 6), (20, 28) <20, (22, 6, 28)>
- Node 21: (21, 9), (21, 18), (21, 25) <21, (9, 18, 25)>
- Node 22: (22, 13), (22, 4), (22, 19), (22, 16), (22, 20) <22, (13, 4, 19)>
- Node 23: (23, 1), (23, 3), (23, 15) <23, (1, 3, 15)>
- Node 24: (24, 16), (24, 5) <24, (16, 5, 24)>
- Node 25: (25, 21), (25, 6), (25, 18) <25, (21, 6, 18)>
- Node 26: (26, 19), (26, 2), (26, 27) <26, (19, 2, 27)>
- Node 27: (27, 7), (27, 26), (27, 14) <27, (7, 26, 14)>
- Node 28: (28, 15), (28, 20), (28, 0) <28, (15, 20, 0)>
- Node 29: (29, 7) <29, (7, 14, 27)>

Now count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [29]
