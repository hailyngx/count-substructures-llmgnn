Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 13) (21, 7) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 17) (4, 8) (4, 28) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 11) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 14) (26, 2) (19, 26) (19, 13) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 23) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 27) (20, 5) (5, 26) (5, 20) (5, 23) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 25) (25, 16) (25, 6) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 10) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 27) (28, 15) (9, 0) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 13) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 22) (11, 6) (2, 26) (2, 6) (23, 17) (23, 5) (6, 25) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 22) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 18) (24, 0) (24, 22) (24, 10) (24, 15) (22, 11) (22, 6) (22, 24) (22, 10) (22, 3) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 24) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 27) (27, 20) (27, 28) (27, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 24) (10, 22) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

1: 26, 20, 13
2: 26, 6
3: 16, 22, 27
4: 8, 28
5: 26, 20, 23
6: 25, 11, 2, 22
7: 21, 11, 17
8: 4, 28, 14, 11
9: 0
10: 0, 24, 14, 22
11: 7, 8, 18, 6, 22
13: 1, 19, 0, 18
14: 8, 26, 10
15: 28, 18, 24
16: 0, 3, 25
17: 7, 20, 23
18: 15, 11, 13
19: 26, 13
20: 1, 17, 27, 5
21: 7
22: 11, 6, 24, 10, 3
23: 17, 5
24: 0, 22, 15, 10
25: 16, 6
26: 1, 19, 5, 14, 2
27: 20, 28, 3
28: 4, 8, 27, 15

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 1: <1, (26, 20, 13)>
- Node 26: <26, (1, 19, 5)>, <26, (2, 14, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (21, 11, 17)>
- Node 4: <4, (8, 28, 14)>
- Node 8: <8, (4, 28, 14)>
- Node 0: <0, (16, 13, 9)>
- Node 16: <16, (0, 25, 3)>
- Node 5: <5, (26, 20, 23)>
- Node 3: <3, (16, 22, 27)>
- Node 25: <25, (16, 6, 25)>
- Node 11: <11, (7, 8, 18)>, <11, (6, 22, 2)>
- Node 2: <2, (26, 6, 2)>
- Node 17: <17, (7, 20, 23)>
- Node 21: <21, (7, 17, 11)>
- Node 9: <9, (0)>
- Node 18: <18, (15, 11, 13)>
- Node 19: <19, (26, 1, 13)>
- Node 20: <20, (1, 17, 27)>
- Node 6: <6, (25, 11, 2)>
- Node 13: <13, (1, 19, 0)>
- Node 24: <24, (0, 22, 10)>
- Node 15: <15, (28, 18, 24)>
- Node 10: <10, (0, 24, 14)>
- Node 27: <27, (20, 28, 3)>
- Node 22: <22, (11, 6, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].
