Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 22) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 19) (27, 6) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 11) (7, 14) (7, 25) (7, 9) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 23) (20, 14) (20, 25) (20, 0) (25, 17) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 2) (0, 21) (0, 20) (0, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 22) (2, 25) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 28) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 28) (26, 3) (28, 17) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 13) (28, 5) (5, 28) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 3) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 10) (9, 7) (9, 8) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 13) (16, 4) (1, 29) (1, 18) (29, 1) (29, 18) (23, 21) (23, 5) (3, 26) (3, 5) (3, 12) (24, 27) (24, 22) (6, 27) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 22) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 24) (22, 12) (11, 17) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 29) (18, 11) (19, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node (center) by exactly three edges in order to form a 3-star graph.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 26, and 22.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 10, 19, and 6.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 7, and 4.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 25, and 28.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 14, 25, and 9.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 13, 0, and 23.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 14, 25, and 0.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 17, 7, and 20.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 14, 16, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 25, 4, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 9, and 26.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 15, 8, and 28.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 17, 2, and 26.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 28, 23, and 12.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 21, 28, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 10.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 15, 27, and 13.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 4.
- Node 1 is connected to node 29.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 1, 18.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[<15, (10, 26, 22)>, <27, (10, 19, 6)>, <14, (17, 7, 4)>, <17, (14, 25, 28)>, <7, (14, 25, 9)>, <21, (13, 0, 23)>, <20, (14, 25, 0)>, <25, (17, 7, 20)>, <4, (14, 16, 2)>, <2, (25, 4, 8)>, <8, (2, 9, 26)>, <26, (15, 8, 28)>, <28, (17, 2, 26)>, <5, (28, 23, 12)>, <13, (21, 28, 10)>]
[<9, (7, 8, 10)>, <16, (4)>, <1, (29)>, <18, (0, 1, 29)>] 
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
