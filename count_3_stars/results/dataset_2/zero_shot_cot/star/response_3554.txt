Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 2) (17, 29) (17, 20) (17, 5) (7, 21) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 2) (22, 23) (22, 19) (23, 7) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 27) (10, 9) (11, 21) (8, 23) (8, 0) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 9) (1, 12) (26, 21) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 28) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 24) (19, 22) (19, 26) (19, 24) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 16) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 4) (28, 20) (20, 17) (20, 28) (20, 12) (20, 24) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 15) (4, 23) (4, 28) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 6) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 12) (3, 12) (3, 6) (27, 23) (27, 29) (27, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 24) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (13, 27) (18, 16) (18, 15) (24, 29) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 9) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. <17, (20, 29, 5)>
2. <21, (2, 11, 26)>
3. <23, (4, 7, 8)>
4. <0, (14, 8, 16)>
5. <28, (4, 16, 26)>
6. <12, (1, 4, 5)>
7. <2, (6, 14, 21)>
8. <5, (12, 16, 17)>
9. <3, (6, 12, 27)>
10. <9, (10, 15, 24)>

As we have found 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
