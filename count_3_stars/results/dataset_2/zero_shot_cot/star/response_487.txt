Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 14) (20, 9) (20, 5) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 18) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 27) (2, 24) (2, 11) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 0) (22, 28) (22, 7) (11, 2) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 17) (28, 14) (28, 4) (3, 13) (24, 26) (24, 2) (24, 19) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 8) (17, 28) (17, 4) (23, 9) (23, 25) (23, 11) (10, 20) (10, 16) (21, 13) (21, 27) (21, 29) (21, 4) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 15) (5, 20) (5, 14) (14, 26) (14, 28) (14, 1) (14, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (7, 22) (7, 13) (13, 3) (13, 21) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 27) (8, 1) (6, 25) (6, 18) (4, 28) (4, 17) (4, 21) (4, 29) (19, 24) (27, 2) (27, 21) (27, 13) (29, 21) (29, 4) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the given edges, let's list the 3-stars:

<9, (26, 15, 20)>
<26, (9, 24, 14)>
<20, (9, 5, 10)>
<25, (6, 23, 18)>
<2, (18, 12, 27)>
<18, (25, 2, 6)>
<11, (2, 28, 23)>
<28, (22, 11, 17)>
<24, (26, 2, 19)>
<1, (9, 14, 8)>
<17, (28, 4, 21)>
<23, (9, 25, 11)>
<10, (20, 16, -)>
<21, (13, 27, 29)>
<0, (18, 11, 16)>
<16, (10, 0, 15)>
<5, (20, 14, -)>
<14, (26, 28, 1)>
<12, (2, 0, -)>
<7, (22, 13, -)>
<13, (3, 21, 7)>
<8, (1, -, -)>
<6, (25, 18, -)>
<4, (28, 17, 21)>
<19, (24, -, -)>
<27, (2, 21, 13)>
<29, (21, 4, -)>
<15, (9, 16, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars we found:
