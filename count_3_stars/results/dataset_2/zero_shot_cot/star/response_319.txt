Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

The nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's list the 3-stars:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 3, 5)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (7, 0, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (7, 1, 0)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 0)>
<9, (7, 8, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
