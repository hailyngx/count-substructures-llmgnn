Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 22) (9, 6) (9, 27) (8, 29) (8, 16) (8, 12) (13, 24) (4, 3) (2, 18) (2, 11) (18, 2) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 22) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 21) (20, 27) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 22) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 24) (1, 7) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 22) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 22) (25, 17) (25, 19) (10, 0) (10, 19) (26, 3) (26, 12) (7, 1) (7, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 19) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 15) (23, 5) (23, 24) (23, 27) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 21) (21, 20) (21, 19) (21, 29) (27, 9) (27, 20) (27, 23) (24, 13) (24, 0) (24, 1) (24, 23) (24, 14) (14, 24) (29, 8) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 21) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 17) (22, 16) (22, 28) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 26) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Let's list all possible 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (20, 17, 22)>
<1, (15, 11, 7)>
<2, (18, 11, 4)>
<3, (19, 26, 4)>
<4, (3, 26, 11)>
<5, (23, 29, 5)>
<6, (9, 27, 22)>
<7, (1, 11, 17)>
<8, (29, 16, 12)>
<9, (6, 27, 22)>
<10, (19, 0, 21)>
<11, (2, 18, 7)>
<12, (15, 8, 17)>
<13, (24, 0, 14)>
<14, (24, 13, 19)>
<15, (1, 23, 28)>
<16, (8, 29, 22)>
<17, (20, 25, 12)>
<18, (2, 11, 0)>
<19, (3, 21, 25)>
<20, (0, 10, 27)>
<21, (20, 29, 19)>
<22, (6, 17, 28)>
<23, (5, 15, 24)>
<24, (13, 1, 14)>
<25, (17, 19, 28)>
<26, (3, 12, 4)>
<27, (9, 20, 23)>
<28, (15, 16, 22)>
<29, (8, 21, 5)>

There are 29 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
