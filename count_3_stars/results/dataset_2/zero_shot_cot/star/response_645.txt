Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 15) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 17) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 4) (15, 12) (15, 17) (19, 2) (19, 10) (4, 6) (4, 17) (4, 16) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 19) (1, 18) (14, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (16, 4) (16, 18) 

Response:
First, let's count the degree of each node:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 3
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 2
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 1
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 5
- Node 19: degree 3

Next, identify the 3-stars in the graph. We can see that 3-stars are formed around nodes with degree 4, as they will have three adjacent nodes. Let's list the 3-stars:
<5, (0, 9, 14)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (9, 3, 12)>
<12, (7, 11, 15)>
<3, (0, 7, 17)>
<17, (3, 6, 15)>
<4, (6, 16, 17)>
<11, (2, 9, 12)>
<13, (7, 12, 18)>
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<6, (4, 10, 17)>
<18, (13, 16, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
