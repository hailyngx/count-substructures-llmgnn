Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 26) (27, 16) (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 25) (4, 29) (8, 10) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 3) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 25) (16, 27) (16, 0) (16, 18) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 26) (29, 4) (29, 6) (29, 14) (19, 12) (19, 9) (14, 28) (14, 29) (14, 23) (22, 0) (24, 3) (24, 17) (24, 20) (24, 25) (20, 24) (20, 26) (26, 27) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 7) (23, 15) (23, 1) (23, 14) (23, 13) (2, 27) (2, 13) (9, 19) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 12) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 24) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 2) (7, 28) (7, 26) (12, 15) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 18) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 
We would look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connecting them to other nodes. 

The nodes and their corresponding degrees are listed below:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 2
Node 5: degree 3
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 4
Node 9: degree 1
Node 10: degree 3
Node 11: degree 2
Node 12: degree 5
Node 13: degree 3
Node 14: degree 3
Node 15: degree 3
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 3
Node 19: degree 2
Node 20: degree 2
Node 21: degree 3
Node 22: degree 1
Node 23: degree 4
Node 24: degree 4
Node 25: degree 4
Node 26: degree 4
Node 27: degree 4
Node 28: degree 4
Node 29: degree 3

Now, we would look for nodes with exactly 3 edges and the nodes they are connected to:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 23, and 21.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 11, and 24.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 29, 12, and 26.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 28, 26, and 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 17, and 25.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 5, and 18.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 15, 28, and 19.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 28, 29, and 23.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 27, 0, and 18.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 0, and 24.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 16, and 12.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 1, 28, and 25.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 15, 1, and 14.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 3, 17, and 25.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 21, 8, and 24.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 27, 6, and 20.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 16, 2, and 26.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 21, 7, and 14.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 14.

Considering these connections, we see that the unique 3-stars are:
<1, (5, 23, 21)>
<3, (8, 11, 24)>
<5, (1, 11, 10)>
<6, (29, 12, 26)>
<7, (28, 26, 0)>
<8, (10, 17, 25)>
<10, (8, 5, 18)>
<12, (15, 28, 19)>
<14, (28, 29, 23)>
<16, (27, 0, 18)>
<17, (8, 0, 24)>
<18, (10, 16, 12)>
<21, (1, 28, 25)>
<23, (15, 1, 14)>
<24, (3, 17, 25)>
<25, (21, 8, 24)>
<26, (27, 6, 20)>
<27, (16, 2, 26)>
<28, (21, 7, 14)>
<29, (4, 6, 14)>

Thus, there are [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
