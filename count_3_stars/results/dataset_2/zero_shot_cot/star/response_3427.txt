Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Start by listing all nodes in the graph based on the edges given:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

2. Identify 3-stars based on the definition provided:
- A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

3. Count the number of 3-stars by checking each node's connections:
- Node 5 has 4 connections: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 0), (5, 3) -> <5, (2, 4, 0)>
- Node 6 has 3 connections: (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 2) -> <6, (1, 7, 2)>
- Node 2 has 3 connections: (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7) -> <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 8 has 3 connections: (8, 9), (8, 1), (8, 7) -> <8, (9, 1, 7)>
- Node 0 has 5 connections: (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 9) -> <0, (5, 7, 3)>
- Node 7 has 5 connections: (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3) -> <7, (6, 2, 8)>
- Node 9 has 5 connections: (9, 8), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 1) -> <9, (8, 0, 4)>
- Node 1 has 4 connections: (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 4) -> <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 4 connections: (3, 5), (3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 9) -> <3, (5, 0, 7)>
- Node 4 has 4 connections: (4, 5), (4, 0), (4, 9), (4, 1) -> <4, (5, 0, 9)>

4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found:
- There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph: {<5, (2, 4, 0)>, <6, (1, 7, 2)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <8, (9, 1, 7)>, <0, (5, 7, 3)>, <7, (6, 2, 8)>, <9, (8, 0, 4)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 0, 7)>}

Therefore, the final answer is: [9].
