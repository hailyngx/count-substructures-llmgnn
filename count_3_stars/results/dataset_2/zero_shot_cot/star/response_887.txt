Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 17) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 10) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 12) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 18) (17, 4) (17, 0) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 16) (19, 2) (19, 14) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in 3-star structures.
- Nodes with degree 1: 7, 0, 17, 11, 19, 7
- Nodes with degree 2: 2, 19
- Nodes with degree 3: 14, 13, 2
- Nodes with degree 4: 11, 12
- Nodes with degree 5: 16
- Nodes with degree 6: 6, 8, 10, 15, 4, 5, 18, 9
Based on the degrees of the nodes, let's count the number of 3-star structures:
- Nodes with degree 3 can be central nodes in 3-stars. There are 2 such nodes: 14 and 13.
- Nodes with degree 4 can also be central nodes in 3-stars, resulting in a total of 2 more 3-stars.
- Nodes with degree 5 can be central nodes too, giving us 1 additional 3-star.
- Nodes with degree 6 will form 3-star structures. There are 1 + 7 = 8 such 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the graph is 2 + 2 + 1 + 8 = 13. 
So, the output is [13]. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found: <14, (18, 19, 16)>, <13, (12, 15, 11)>, <12, (5, 13, 11)>, <11, (12, 1, 15)>, <16, (2, 14, 4)>, <18, (4, 14, 17)>, <5, (8, 12, 10)>, <4, (8, 16, 17)>, <2, (10, 16, 15)>, <19, (2, 14, 18)>, <15, (10, 0, 13)>, <10, (9, 5, 15)>, <9, (1, 6, 10)>.
