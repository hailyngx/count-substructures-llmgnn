Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

From the provided edges, the 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (4, 5, 0)>
<3, (7, 1, 8)>
<5, (7, 1, 8)>
<6, (8, 5, 0)>
<9, (7, 1, 8)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars which is [6].
