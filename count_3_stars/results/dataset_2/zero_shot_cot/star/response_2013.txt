Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 0) (17, 1) (19, 4) (19, 7) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 2) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 9) (12, 16) (10, 13) (10, 2) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Next, count the degrees of the nodes:
Node 0: degree 4
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 4
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 3
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 2
Node 9: degree 4
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 2
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 2
Node 15: degree 4
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 2
Node 18: degree 4
Node 19: degree 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<3, (15, 11, 18)>
<15, (3, 9, 13)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<9, (15, 6, 16)>
<4, (19, 2, -)>
<8, (6, 11, -)>
<0, (6, 17, 5)>
<14, (2, 13, -)>
<5, (15, 0, 13)>
<13, (15, 14, 5)>
<11, (3, 8, 1)>
<1, (11, 17, 18)>
<17, (0, 1, -)>
<19, (4, 7, -)>
<7, (6, 19, 16)>
<16, (9, 7, 12)>
<12, (9, 16, -)>
<10, (13, 2, -)>
<18, (3, 11, 1)>
<2, (4, 14, 10)>

There are [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
