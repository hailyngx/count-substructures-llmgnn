Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected in the star pattern.

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 2, and 4 <6, (7, 2, 4)>
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 1, and 7 <9, (3, 1, 7)>
3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 4 <1, (9, 5, 4)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 8 <3, (9, 7, 8)>
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8 <5, (1, 2, 8)>
6. Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 8 <0, (9, 1, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
