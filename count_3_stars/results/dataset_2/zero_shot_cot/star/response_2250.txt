Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 28) (9, 14) (2, 6) (29, 8) (29, 12) (29, 10) (3, 25) (3, 7) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 4) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 18) (21, 14) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 20) (11, 0) (11, 8) (1, 16) (1, 7) (1, 4) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 7) (0, 11) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 17) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 6) (22, 10) (10, 29) (10, 22) (15, 9) (15, 19) (23, 26) (23, 4) (23, 13) (18, 21) (18, 19) (18, 20) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 13) (26, 23) (26, 20) (8, 29) (8, 28) (8, 11) (6, 2) (6, 22) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 21) (14, 6) (14, 20) (24, 17) (24, 12) (20, 28) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 14) (20, 16) (4, 25) (4, 1) (4, 23) (27, 21) (27, 17) (27, 22) (13, 25) (13, 23) (13, 19) (13, 16) (16, 1) (16, 22) (16, 20) (16, 13) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 24) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. From the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars by observing nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.
2. The nodes with three edges:
   - Node 9: (9, 22), (9, 15), (9, 28), (9, 14)
   - Node 28: (28, 9), (28, 21), (28, 8), (28, 20)
   - Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 17)
   - Node 22: (22, 9), (22, 27), (22, 16), (22, 6)
   - Node 29: (29, 8), (29, 12), (29, 10)
   - Node 3: (3, 25), (3, 7)
   - Node 25: (25, 3), (25, 13), (25, 4)
   - Node 21: (21, 28), (21, 27), (21, 18), (21, 14)
   - Node 15: (15, 9), (15, 19)
   - Node 16: (16, 1), (16, 22), (16, 20), (16, 13)
   - Node 4: (4, 25), (4, 1), (4, 23)
   - Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 22), (6, 14)
   - Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 21), (14, 6), (14, 20)

So, the unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
<9, (22, 15, 28)>
<28, (21, 8, 20)>
<7, (5, 3, 17)>
<22, (9, 27, 6)>
<29, (8, 12, 10)>
<3, (25, 7, 0)>
<25, (13, 4, 3)>
<21, (27, 14, 18)>
<15, (9, 19, 0)>
<16, (1, 22, 20)>
<4, (1, 23, 25)>
<6, (2, 14, 22)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
