Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 24) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 26) (7, 20) (12, 21) (12, 27) (12, 26) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 19) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 29) (0, 11) (0, 5) (20, 7) (20, 9) (20, 23) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 13) (24, 21) (24, 26) (24, 16) (26, 17) (26, 12) (26, 24) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 23) (5, 0) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 18) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (19, 1) (19, 27) (15, 17) (15, 18) (9, 17) (9, 20) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 28) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 23) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 15) (18, 13) (25, 16) (25, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 25) (4, 14) (4, 28) (4, 23) (23, 20) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 13) (22, 10) (22, 28) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. These will be the potential central nodes of 3-stars.

2. For each potential central node, check if it is connected to exactly three nodes.

3. If the potential central node meets the criteria in step 2, check the three connected nodes to ensure they are not connected to each other. If they are not connected to each other, a 3-star is found.

Let's begin the process:

Potential central nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (2, 14, 19).
- Node 10 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (3, 18, 29).
- Node 20 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (7, 9, 23).
- Node 27 is connected to exactly 3 other nodes (12, 19, 29).

After checking, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (2, 14, 19)>
<10, (3, 18, 29)>
<27, (12, 19, 29)>
