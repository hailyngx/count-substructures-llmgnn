Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Central node: 4
  Leaves: 9, 10, 11
  <4, (9, 10, 11)>

- Central node: 7
  Leaves: 0, 3, 6
  <7, (0, 3, 6)>

- Central node: 10
  Leaves: 4, 6, 1
  <10, (4, 6, 1)>

- Central node: 11
  Leaves: 4, 9, 6
  <11, (4, 9, 6)>

- Central node: 5
  Leaves: 10, 6, 13
  <5, (10, 6, 13)>

- Central node: 6
  Leaves: 4, 7, 10
  <6, (4, 7, 10)>
  Leaves: 11, 5, 13
  <6, (11, 5, 13)>

- Central node: 0
  Leaves: 7, 14, 9
  <0, (7, 14, 9)>

- Central node: 14
  Leaves: 0, 3, 1
  <14, (0, 3, 1)>

- Central node: 2
  Leaves: 11, 0, 12
  <2, (11, 0, 12)>

- Central node: 13
  Leaves: 7, 5, 6
  <13, (7, 5, 6)>

- Central node: 12
  Leaves: 5, 14, 2
  <12, (5, 14, 2)>

Through the above analysis, we have found that there are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
