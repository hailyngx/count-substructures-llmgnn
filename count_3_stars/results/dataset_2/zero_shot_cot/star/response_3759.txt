Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 13) (15, 16) (15, 3) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 11) (2, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 3) (13, 7) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 17) (1, 18) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 19) (14, 6) (14, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (9, 1) (9, 4) (12, 18) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 12) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<11, (16, 19, 18)>
<16, (11, 8, 15)>
<3, (15, 17, 13)>
<15, (16, 3, 0)>
<18, (11, 19, 12)>
<19, (11, 18, 17)>
<0, (17, 4, 8)>
<2, (11, 10, 19)>
<8, (16, 0, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<13, (3, 7, 17)>
<1, (18, 9, 7)>
<6, (16, 14, 10)>
<17, (3, 0, 18)>
<14, (6, 10, 16)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<12, (18, 10, 19)>
<10, (2, 14, 4)>
<7, (8, 5, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [20]
