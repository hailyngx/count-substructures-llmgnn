Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 2) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star pattern starting from each node.

<6, (9, 12, 14)>
<9, (6, 1, 10)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 1, 13)>
<4, (1, 8, 13)>
<8, (6, 4, 11)>
<0, (8, 5, 14)>
<14, (6, 0, 2)>
<12, (6, 3, 4)>
<7, (8, 2, 5)>
<11, (8, 9, 5)>
<2, (9, 7, 14)>
<5, (1, 0, 7)>
<13, (9, 1, 3)>
<10, (9, 2, 14)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [15].
