Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (4, 14) (4, 3) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing down all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 6, 12)>
<1, (5, 10, 14)>
<2, (9, 11, 8)>
<3, (2, 8, 12)>
<4, (14, 3, 13)>
<5, (6, 0, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 12)>
<7, (11, 8, 13)>
<8, (2, 3, 1)>
<9, (2, 12, 13)>
<10, (1, 13, 11)>
<11, (10, 14, 7)>
<12, (0, 6, 8)>
<13, (10, 0, 14)>
<14, (11, 1, 4)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars which is 14.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
