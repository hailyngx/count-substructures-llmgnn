Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Counting them all, there are a total of [7] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
