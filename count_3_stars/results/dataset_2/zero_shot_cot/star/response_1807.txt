Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 8) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 8) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them since those could potentially be the central node of a 3-star. The nodes meeting this criteria are 6, 10, and 13. Let's examine each one:

Node 6:
- (6, 9)
- (6, 1)
- (6, 10)
- (6, 3)
- (6, 4)
Node 10:
- (10, 6)
- (10, 11)
- (10, 8)
- (10, 7)
- (10, 13)
Node 13:
- (13, 10)
- (13, 5)
- (13, 2)
- (13, 0)
- (13, 7)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
<6, (9, 1, 10)>
<6, (3, 4, 10)>
<10, (11, 8, 6)>
<10, (7, 13, 6)>
<13, (5, 2, 10)>
<13, (0, 7, 10)>
