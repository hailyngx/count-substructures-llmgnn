Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 12) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 19) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (2, 18) (2, 3) (2, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 18) (13, 1) (17, 11) (12, 16) (12, 4) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (15, 2) (15, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-star graphs. The central nodes will be the nodes with exactly three edges.
1. Node 11 has 4 edges: (11, 16), (11, 0), (11, 18), (11, 17)
2. Node 16 has 4 edges: (16, 11), (16, 7), (16, 0), (16, 12)
3. Node 18 has 4 edges: (18, 11), (18, 7), (18, 2), (18, 13)
4. Node 8 has 4 edges: (8, 9), (8, 14), (8, 3), (8, 1)
5. Node 14 has 4 edges: (14, 9), (14, 4), (14, 8), (14, 8)
6. Node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 13), (1, 10)
7. Node 0 has 4 edges: (0, 11), (0, 16), (0, 10), (0, 19)

Now, we will list out the 3-star graphs by considering the central nodes and the nodes connected to them through edges:
<11, (16, 0, 18)>
<16, (11, 7, 0)>
<18, (11, 7, 2)>
<8, (9, 14, 3)>
<14, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 13)>
<0, (11, 16, 10)>

So, there are a total of [7] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
