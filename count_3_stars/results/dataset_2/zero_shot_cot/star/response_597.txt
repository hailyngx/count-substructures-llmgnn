Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that make up each 3-star in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 1), (0, 3)
2. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 3), (1, 0)
3. Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 6)
4. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 0)
5. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 6), (4, 2)
6. Node 5: (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 3)
7. Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 2)
8. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 2)
9. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 6)
10. Node 9: (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 2: No 3-star
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: No 3-star
- Node 6: No 3-star
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: No 3-star
- Node 9: <9, (0, 3, 7)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
