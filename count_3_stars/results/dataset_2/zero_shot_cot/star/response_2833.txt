Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 19) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7) (9, 8) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 8) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 18) (0, 5) (16, 17) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 11) (19, 18) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 1) (14, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 1 has 4 edges: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19)

2. Nodes with 2 edges:
- Node 3 has 4 edges: (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4)
- Node 8 has 4 edges: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7)
- Node 13 has 5 edges: (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 9)
- Node 5 has 4 edges: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7)
- Node 11 has 5 edges: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15)
- Node 17 has 4 edges: (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 7)
- Node 18 has 4 edges: (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 19)
- Node 7 has 5 edges: (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 14)

3. Nodes with 1 edge or isolated nodes:
- Node 4 has 1 edge: (4, 3)
- Node 12 has 2 edges: (12, 5) (12, 18)
- Node 0 has 1 edge: (0, 5)
- Node 16 has 1 edge: (16, 17)
- Node 6 has 1 edge: (6, 19)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- From node 1: <1, (3, 17, 14)>, <1, (3, 17, 19)>
- From node 3: <3, (1, 11, 4)>
- From node 8: <8, (13, 9, 15)>
- From node 13: <13, (8, 17, 2)>
- From node 5: <5, (2, 12, 0)>
- From node 11: <11, (3, 13, 7)>, <11, (3, 15, 19)>, <11, (13, 7, 15)>
- From node 17: <17, (1, 13, 16)>, <17, (1, 13, 7)>
- From node 18: <18, (10, 12, 19)>
- From node 7: <7, (8, 5, 11)>, <7, (8, 5, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
