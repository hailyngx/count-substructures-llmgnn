Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 17) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 0) (1, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 8) (5, 16) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (10, 18) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 12) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (0, 18) (0, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 14) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step:

1. Count the degrees of each node:
- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 4
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 4
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 2

2. Identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4 is a central node of a 3-star: <4, (7, 12, 13)>
- Node 7 is a central node of a 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 12 is a central node of a 3-star: <12, (4, 11, 15)>
- Node 13 is a central node of a 3-star: <13, (3, 4, 14)>
- Node 14 is a central node of a 3-star: <14, (3, 4, 9)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [5]
