Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 12) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 17) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 0) (20, 13) (20, 11) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 14) (2, 29) (2, 27) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 3) (1, 26) (3, 29) (3, 27) (3, 23) (26, 1) (26, 10) (19, 5) (19, 17) (11, 20) (11, 0) (11, 21) (11, 4) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 15) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 10) (7, 5) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 27) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 21) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 13) (8, 28) (24, 17) (24, 14) (15, 28) (15, 23) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 15) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 7) (27, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 12) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 24) (13, 20) (13, 10) (13, 27) (21, 11) (21, 4) (14, 9) (14, 25) (14, 24) 

Response:
Given graph statistics: 
- Total nodes: 30
- Total edges: 90

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[<5, (9, 12, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 25)>, <6, (9, 12, 0)>, <18, (22, 16, 25)>, <22, (18, 27, 0)>, <20, (13, 11, 20)>, <25, (9, 18, 14)>, <2, (29, 27, 7)>, <29, (2, 7, 3)>, <1, (26, 10, 1)>, <3, (29, 27, 23)>, <26, (1, 10, 26)>, <19, (5, 17, 19)>, <11, (20, 0, 4)>, <28, (16, 8, 15)>, <16, (18, 28, 10)>, <7, (5, 29, 23)>, <4, (11, 17, 21)>, <10, (9, 26, 16)>, <8, (28, 15, 8)>, <24, (17, 14, 24)>, <15, (28, 23, 15)>, <23, (3, 7, 15)>, <27, (22, 2, 13)>, <12, (5, 6, 0)>, <0, (22, 11, 12)>, <17, (18, 4, 24)>, <13, (20, 10, 27)>, <21, (11, 4, 21)>]
