Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 1) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to the central node. 
For each node, we will count the number of edges going into and out of that node to determine the 3-stars.

Node 1:
- (4, 1), (7, 1), (13, 1), (0, 1), (1, 11)
- <1, (4, 7, 13)>

Node 2:
- (8, 2), (2, 11), (0, 2)
- <2, (8, 11, 0)>

Node 3:
- (4, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (3, 4)
- <3, (4, 7, 6)>

Node 4:
- (4, 1), (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 3), (12, 4), (1, 4)
- <4, (1, 7, 6)>

Node 5:
- (8, 5), (5, 13), (5, 12), (5, 11), (5, 3), (5, 14)
- <5, (8, 13, 12)>

Node 6:
- (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 9), (6, 10), (14, 6)
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>

Node 7:
- (4, 7), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1)
- <7, (4, 0, 3)>

Node 8:
- (8, 2), (8, 5), (8, 14)
- <8, (2, 5, 14)>

Node 10:
- (6, 10), (13, 10), (12, 10)
- <10, (6, 13, 12)>

Node 11:
- (2, 11), (5, 11), (11, 12), (11, 1)
- <11, (2, 5, 12)>

Node 12:
- (12, 4), (12, 5), (12, 10), (12, 11)
- <12, (4, 5, 10)>

Node 13:
- (13, 5), (13, 1), (13, 10), (13, 0)
- <13, (5, 1, 10)>

Node 14:
- (8, 14), (5, 14), (6, 14)
- <14, (8, 5, 6)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars found:
[12]
