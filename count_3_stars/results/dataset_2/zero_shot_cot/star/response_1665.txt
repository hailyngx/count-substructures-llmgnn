Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. As mentioned earlier, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>

Now we need to count the total number of 3-stars. 

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
