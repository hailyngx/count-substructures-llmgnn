Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 0, and 3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 0. <5, (6, 8, 0)>

2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 4, 7, and 0. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 4, and 7. <9, (8, 4, 7)>

3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 8, and 0. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 8. <4, (9, 7, 8)>

4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, and 3. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 4. <7, (5, 9, 4)>

5. There are no more nodes that are connected exactly to 3 other nodes in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <5, (6, 8, 0)>, <9, (8, 4, 7)>, <4, (9, 7, 8)>, and <7, (5, 9, 4)>.
