Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 17) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 18) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 6) (29, 25) (7, 3) (7, 23) (7, 13) (21, 23) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 20) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (20, 8) (20, 11) (25, 29) (25, 5) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 3) (27, 22) (10, 17) (10, 11) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 23) (0, 13) (0, 28) (0, 11) (11, 20) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (22, 26) (22, 27) (1, 17) (28, 9) (28, 26) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 24) (18, 26) (18, 13) (5, 25) (5, 16) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 16) (6, 29) (6, 11) (6, 24) (6, 15) (24, 28) (24, 6) (24, 16) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (16, 24) (16, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 16) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 4) (23, 7) (23, 21) (23, 17) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are directly connected to node 9, which is the center of a potential 3-star. 

Node 9 is connected to nodes 26, 28, and 17.  
<9, (26, 28, 17)>

Node 26 is already included in a 3-star with another node as the center, so we only consider nodes 28 and 17 as the potential centers for other 3-stars. 

Next, let's identify all nodes that are directly connected to node 2, which is the center of a potential 3-star. 

Node 2 is connected to nodes 29, 19, 13, and 14.  
<2, (29, 19, 13)>  
<2, (29, 6, 25)>

Similarly, we identify potential 3-stars around nodes 7, 21, 8, 20, 25, 12, 10, 0, 11, 22, 1, and 6 respectively:

<7, (3, 23, 13)>  
<21, (23, 17, 1)>  
<8, (13, 14, 20)>  
<20, (8, 11, 25)>  
<25, (29, 5, 6)>  
<12, (14, 15, 3)>  
<10, (17, 11, 21)>  
<0, (13, 28, 11)>  
<11, (20, 10, 6)>  
<22, (26, 27, -)>  
<1, (17, 21, -)>  
<6, (29, 11, 24)>

Note: For node 22 and 27, we don't have enough information to find their possible 3-stars, so we represent them as '-' for now.

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars:

Total number of 3-stars = 13  
Therefore, the final answer is [13].
