Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 18) (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 13) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 14) (29, 16) (29, 2) (29, 20) (7, 12) (7, 10) (3, 23) (3, 4) (26, 19) (26, 13) (12, 7) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 17) (8, 2) (8, 28) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 21) (13, 26) (13, 18) (28, 16) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 25) (10, 21) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 23) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 22) (20, 1) (20, 2) (20, 29) (4, 3) (4, 0) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 13) (22, 15) (22, 6) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 27) (25, 28) (25, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (6, 22) (6, 25) (6, 24) (24, 6) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 23) (5, 27) (23, 3) (23, 10) (23, 9) (23, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 4) (27, 11) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 5) (14, 2) (14, 28) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. From node 11: (11, 16, 27), (11, 5, 15)
2. From node 16: (16, 11, 28), (16, 29, 18)
3. From node 1: (1, 21, 20)
4. From node 21: (21, 1, 10), (21, 13, 10)
5. From node 2: (2, 29, 20)
6. From node 29: (29, 16, 20)
7. From node 7: (7, 12, 10)
8. From node 3: (3, 23, 4)
9. From node 26: (26, 19, 13)
10. From node 12: (12, 7, 10)
11. From node 19: (19, 26, 18)
12. From node 8: (8, 2, 28)
13. From node 13: (13, 21, 26)
14. From node 28: (28, 16, 8)
15. From node 10: (10, 21, 7), (10, 15, 27), (10, 23, 9)
16. From node 15: (15, 11, 0), (15, 10, 22)
17. From node 20: (20, 1, 29)
18. From node 4: (4, 3, 0)
19. From node 18: (18, 16, 19)
20. From node 22: (22, 15, 6)
21. From node 17: (17, 19, 5)
22. From node 25: (25, 28, 6)
23. From node 9: (9, 8, 23)
24. From node 6: (6, 22, 25), (6, 24, 6)
25. From node 24: (24, 6, 5)

Counting all the above unique 3-stars, we find a total of 25 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [25]
