Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars.

1. The central node must have exactly 3 edges connected to it to form a 3-star. 
   From the given edges, we can identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges:
   - Node 5 has edges to nodes 9, 6, and 8.
   - Node 4 has edges to nodes 9, 2, and 0.
2. For each identified central node, we check if the connected nodes form a 3-star configuration.
   - For node 5: (5, 9, 6, 8) form a 3-star. <5, (9, 6, 8)>
   - For node 4: (4, 9, 2, 0) do not form a 3-star since both 2 and 0 have other connections.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. The unique 3-star is <5, (9, 6, 8)>.
