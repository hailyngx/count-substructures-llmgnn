Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 16) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 11) (1, 10) (1, 18) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 6) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 6) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 12) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by looking at each node in the graph. For a node to be a central node in a 3-star, it should have exactly three neighbors. Let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<4, (15, 7, 10)>
<10, (4, 11, 1)>
<11, (10, 9, 13)>
<0, (16, 6, 12)>
<6, (15, 0, 18)>
<12, (0, 8, 17)>
<15, (3, 6, 4)>
<18, (1, 19, 6)>
<19, (7, 5, 18)>
<3, (15, 14, 6)>
<7, (15, 4, 19)>
<1, (10, 18, 0)>
<9, (10, 11, 12)>
<5, (4, 19, 14)>
<13, (11, 9, 0)>
<8, (6, 12, 0)>
<16, (0, 2, 6)>
<17, (12, 15, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
