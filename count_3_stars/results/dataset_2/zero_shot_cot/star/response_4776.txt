Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars: 
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 8, 1, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 3, 2, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 7, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 9, and 0.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 2, and 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 3, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 9, 0, and 4.

Based on this information, we can see that there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (6, 2, 8)> 
<6, (5, 7, 3)> 
<8, (5, 1, 9)> 
<9, (2, 1, 7)> 
<3, (6, 7, 4)> 
<7, (6, 9, 3)> 
<2, (5, 6, 9)> 
<0, (5, 9, 2)> 
<4, (5, 6, 3)> 
<1, (5, 8, 9)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
