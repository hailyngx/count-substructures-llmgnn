Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's list out the degrees of each node:
Node 0: degree 5
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 5
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 5
Node 5: degree 5
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 4
Node 8: degree 6
Node 9: degree 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
<4, (6, 0, 2)>
<5, (6, 2, 7)>

Therefore, there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
