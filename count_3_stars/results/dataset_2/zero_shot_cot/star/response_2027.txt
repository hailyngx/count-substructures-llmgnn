Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 3) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes in each 3-star configuration.

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges connected:
- Node 5 has 4 edges connected: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 0), (5, 3)
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected: (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 12)
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected: (4, 7), (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 11)
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected: (7, 4), (7, 10), (7, 2), (7, 1)
- Node 13 has 5 edges connected: (13, 4), (13, 8), (13, 11), (13, 3), (13, 14)
- Node 10 has 3 edges connected: (10, 7), (10, 12), (10, 14)
- Node 6 has 5 edges connected: (6, 5), (6, 11), (6, 14), (6, 2), (6, 12)
- Node 12 has 5 edges connected: (12, 9), (12, 4), (12, 10), (12, 6), (12, 3)
- Node 1 has 3 edges connected: (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 0)
- Node 0 has 4 edges connected: (0, 5), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 2)
- Node 3 has 5 edges connected: (3, 5), (3, 13), (3, 12), (3, 0), (3, 14)
- Node 14 has 4 edges connected: (14, 13), (14, 10), (14, 6), (14, 3)
- Node 2 has 5 edges connected: (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 11), (2, 6), (2, 0)

2. Count the 3-stars using the identified central nodes:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 0 <5, (9, 6, 0)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 11, and 14 <6, (5, 11, 14)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 10, and 2 <7, (4, 10, 2)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 8, and 11 <13, (4, 8, 11)>
- Node 6 forms another 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and 12 <6, (2, 11, 12)>

[The total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 5, so the final count is [5].]
