Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <5, (9, 6, 13)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 14)>
3. <6, (5, 9, 0)>
4. <0, (9, 6, 10)>
5. <10, (9, 1, 0)>
6. <4, (5, 3, 7)>
7. <7, (5, 1, 4)>
8. <8, (6, 3, 10)>
9. <3, (11, 14, 4)>
10. <11, (3, 12, 2)>
11. <12, (3, 11, 14)>
12. <13, (5, 9, 2)>
13. <14, (9, 3, 7)>

There are a total of 13 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [13].
