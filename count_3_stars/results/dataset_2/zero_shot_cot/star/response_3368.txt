Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 14) (12, 19) (12, 14) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (1, 2) (1, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 3. This forms a 3-star with center node 4 and leaves 7, 11, 3. <4, (7, 11, 3)>

2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 10. This forms a 3-star with center node 7 and leaves 4, 11, 10. <7, (4, 11, 10)>

3. Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 11, and 0. This forms a 3-star with center node 10 and leaves 7, 11, 0. <10, (7, 11, 0)>

4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and no other nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

5. Node 9 is connected to nodes 13, no other nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 18, and no other nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

7. Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 17. This forms a 3-star with center node 2 and leaves 8, 1, 17. <2, (8, 1, 17)>

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 19. This forms a 3-star with center node 8 and leaves 6, 2, 19. <8, (6, 2, 19)>

9. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 18. This forms a 3-star with center node 3 and leaves 4, 0, 18. <3, (4, 0, 18)>

10. Node 19 is connected to nodes 8, 15, and 1. This forms a 3-star with center node 19 and leaves 8, 15, 1. <19, (8, 15, 1)>

11. Node 0 is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 16. This forms a 3-star with center node 0 and leaves 10, 3, 16. <0, (10, 3, 16)>

12. Node 16 is connected to nodes 0, 14, and no other nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

13. Node 12 is connected to nodes 19, 14, and no other nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

14. Node 15 is connected to nodes 8, 19, and 13. This forms a 3-star with center node 15 and leaves 8, 19, 13. <15, (8, 19, 13)>

15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 19. This forms a 3-star with center node 14 and leaves 10, 3, 19. <14, (10, 3, 19)>

16. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 19, and no other nodes, so it doesn't form a 3-star.

17. Node 18 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 13. This forms a 3-star with center node 18 and leaves 5, 3, 13. <18, (5, 3, 13)>

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<4, (7, 11, 3)>, <7, (4, 11, 10)>, <10, (7, 11, 0)>, <2, (8, 1, 17)>, <8, (6, 2, 19)>, <3, (4, 0, 18)>, <19, (8, 15, 1)>, <0, (10, 3, 16)>, <15, (8, 19, 13)>, <14, (10, 3, 19)>, <18, (5, 3, 13)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
