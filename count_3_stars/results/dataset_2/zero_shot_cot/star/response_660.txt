Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 4, node 7, and node 9, since they are potential centers of 3-stars. Based on the edges provided, we find the following connections:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 1, and 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 1, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 6, and 8.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
1. For node 4: (4, 7, 9), (4, 7, 1), (4, 7, 6) - Total: 3
2. For node 7: (7, 4, 9), (7, 4, 1), (7, 4, 8) - Total: 3
3. For node 9: (9, 4, 7), (9, 4, 6), (9, 4, 8) - Total: 3

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 9.
[9]

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (7, 9, 6)>
<7, (4, 9, 1)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
