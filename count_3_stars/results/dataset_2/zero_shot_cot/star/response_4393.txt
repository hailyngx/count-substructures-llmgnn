Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (18, 16) (18, 7) (2, 9) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) (15, 16) (15, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique occurrence of a 3-star pattern.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:
<11, (1, 6, 19)>
<16, (11, 15, 18)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, -)>
<4, (- , 5, 12)>
<7, (- , 4, 6)>
<1, (- , 11, 17)>
<3, (- , 1, 14)>
<8, (10, 12, 13)>
<13, (8, - , -)>
<10, (- , 8, 14)>
<17, (- , 1, 19)>
<19, (- , 11, 17)>
<12, (4, 6, 8)>
<18, (7, 16, -)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-star patterns:
