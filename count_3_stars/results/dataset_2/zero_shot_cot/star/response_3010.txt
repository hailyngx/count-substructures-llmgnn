Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in this given graph, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify all the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors, as these nodes can potentially be the centers of the 3-star graphs.
2. For each identified potential center node, check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. If it is, then that center node along with its 3 neighbors forms a 3-star graph.
3. Count the unique 3-star graphs found.

Let's go ahead and identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

Identified potential center nodes: 5, 9, 4, 3, 8, 2

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 1)>
<3, (5, 4, 1)>
<8, (5, 4, 0)>
<1, (3, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [8].
