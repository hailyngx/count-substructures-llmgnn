Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 4) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 19) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 5) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 5) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 19) (0, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 0) (9, 14) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 16) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 9) (16, 4) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 17) (6, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star subgraphs in this given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 19. Therefore, a 3-star is formed at node 0 with leaves 11, 7, 19. <0, (11, 7, 19)>

2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 17, 8, 4, 5, 15. Since it has more than 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

3. Node 2 has only 1 connection, so it cannot form a 3-star.

4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 17, 8, 12. Therefore, a 3-star is formed at node 3 with leaves 17, 8, 12. <3, (17, 8, 12)>

5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 1, 16. Therefore, a 3-star is formed at node 4 with leaves 11, 1, 16. <4, (11, 1, 16)>

6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 8, 18, 1. Since it has more than 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 12. Since it has less than 3 connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 19, 13. Therefore, a 3-star is formed at node 7 with leaves 0, 19, 13. <7, (0, 19, 13)>

9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 3, 1. Since it has more than 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 14. Since it has less than 3 connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

11. Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 5. Since it has less than 3 connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

12. Node 11 is already considered in the 3-star at node 4.

13. Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 3. Since it has less than 3 connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 16. Since it has less than 3 connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 18, 15, 9. Since it has more than 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

16. Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 19, 14. Since it has more than 3 connections, it does not form a 3-star.

17. Node 16 is connected to nodes 4, 13. Since it has less than 3 connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

18. Node 17 is already considered in the 3-star at node 0 and 3.

19. Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 14. Since it has less than 3 connections, it cannot form a 3-star.

20. Node 19 is already considered in the 3-star at node 0 and 7.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is **2**. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (11, 7, 19)> and <3, (17, 8, 12)>.

The final answer is **[2]**.
