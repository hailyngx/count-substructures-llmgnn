Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. According to the definition, each 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Here is the breakdown of potential 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 has (1, 0, 3) as its neighbors.
- Node 9 has (6, 1, 7) as its neighbors.
- Node 6 has (1, 3, 2) as its neighbors.
- Node 4 has (1, 7, 6) as its neighbors.
- Node 7 has (9, 4, 8) as its neighbors.
- Node 8 has (5, 7, 0) as its neighbors.
- Node 2 has (6, 1, 0) as its neighbors.
- Node 1 has (5, 9, 6) as its neighbors.
- Node 3 has (5, 6, 8) as its neighbors.
- Node 0 has (5, 8, 2) as its neighbors.

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with (1, 0, 3)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with (6, 1, 7)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with (1, 3, 2)
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with (9, 4, 8)

Thus, there are [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph, which are:
<5, (1, 0, 3)>
<9, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 8)>
