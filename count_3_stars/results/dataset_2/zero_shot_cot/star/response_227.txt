Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 4, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 7, 0)>
<8, (1, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 6, 1)>
<0, (5, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph: [10].
