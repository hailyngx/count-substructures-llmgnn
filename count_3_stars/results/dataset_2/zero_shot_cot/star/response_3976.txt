Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (4, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 0) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 18) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 18) (9, 7) (9, 4) (9, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 6) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 15) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 16. <1, (3, 10, 16)>
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 13. <3, (1, 7, 13)>
3. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 19. <5, (8, 13, 19)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 13, and 0. <7, (3, 13, 0)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 14. <8, (5, 12, 14)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 18. <9, (4, 7, 18)>
7. Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 12. <10, (1, 0, 12)>
8. Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 11, and 14. <13, (5, 11, 14)>
9. Node 15 is connected to nodes 17, 19, and 6. <15, (17, 19, 6)>
10. Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 0. <16, (1, 5, 0)>
11. Node 18 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 6. <18, (11, 14, 6)>
12. Node 19 is connected to nodes 17, 15, and 5. <19, (17, 15, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
