Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

1. <4, (5, 9, 7)>
2. <7, (9, 4, 6)>
3. <8, (4, 2, 3)>
4. <6, (7, 2, 0)>
5. <2, (9, 7, 8)>
6. <1, (5, 7, 0)>

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
