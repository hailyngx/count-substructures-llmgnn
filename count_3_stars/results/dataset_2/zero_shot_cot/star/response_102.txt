Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 12) (13, 19) (13, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 0) (17, 5) (17, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 11) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 10) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 0) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (10, 16) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars we can find in the graph:

<0, (1, 12, 15)>
<1, (0, 4, 18)>
<2, (16, 18, 4)>
<3, (6, 9, 12)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 11, 19)>
<6, (3, 5, 19)>
<7, (4, 14, 5)>
<8, (16, 19, 8)>
<9, (3, 14, 15)>
<10, (16, 8, 19)>
<11, (5, 12, 15)>
<12, (0, 3, 14)>
<13, (14, 19, 12)>
<14, (7, 9, 13)>
<15, (0, 9, 11)>
<16, (2, 8, 10)>
<17, (5, 15, 17)>
<18, (1, 2, 16)>
<19, (5, 8, 11)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars identified gives us [19].
