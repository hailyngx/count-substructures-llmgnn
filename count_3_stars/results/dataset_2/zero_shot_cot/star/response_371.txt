Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 16) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 15) (1, 18) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 0) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 19) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 14) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 9) (12, 0) (11, 19) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 9) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 9) (17, 18) (17, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 3) (9, 16) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be our potential central nodes for the 3-stars. 

The following nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 13), (4, 2)
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 10), (7, 13)
- Node 13: (13, 4), (13, 7), (13, 6)
- Node 2: (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 16)
- Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 18), (5, 6), (5, 0)
- Node 1: (1, 18), (1, 15), (1, 14), (1, 0)
- Node 6: (6, 13), (6, 5), (6, 15)
- Node 18: (18, 5), (18, 17), (18, 1)
- Node 15: (15, 6), (15, 1), (15, 10), (15, 19)
- Node 10: (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 15), (10, 14)
- Node 19: (19, 15), (19, 11), (19, 9)
- Node 16: (16, 2), (16, 17), (16, 9)
- Node 17: (17, 18), (17, 16)
- Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 19), (9, 3), (9, 16)
- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 10), (8, 0)
- Node 0: (0, 8), (0, 5), (0, 1), (0, 12)

Now, we can count the 3-stars in this graph. 

[<4, (7, 9, 13)>, <7, (4, 10, 13)>, <13, (4, 7, 6)>, <2, (4, 8, 5)>, <5, (2, 18, 6)>, <1, (18, 15, 14)>, <6, (13, 5, 15)>, <18, (5, 17, 1)>, <15, (6, 1, 10)>, <10, (7, 8, 15)>, <19, (15, 11, 9)>, <16, (2, 17, 9)>, <17, (18, 16, 0)>, <9, (4, 19, 3)>, <8, (2, 10, 0)>]
