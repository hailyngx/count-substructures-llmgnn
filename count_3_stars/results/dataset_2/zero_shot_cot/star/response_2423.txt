Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 25) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 12) (0, 2) (27, 14) (7, 21) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 22) (21, 2) (10, 11) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 29) (23, 11) (23, 6) (23, 24) (23, 9) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 17) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 23) (6, 5) (28, 29) (28, 26) (29, 0) (29, 8) (29, 28) (29, 19) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 4) (2, 0) (2, 21) (2, 22) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 20) (22, 25) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 29) (19, 22) (19, 18) (9, 7) (9, 23) (9, 18) (9, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 24) (1, 20) (1, 25) (20, 12) (20, 22) (20, 1) (14, 27) (14, 5) (14, 13) (25, 15) (25, 22) (25, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (16, 5) (16, 26) (16, 4) (24, 23) (24, 17) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 26) (4, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to the center node (nodes with degree 3). From the edge list provided, the nodes with degree 3 are 0, 5, 11, 15, 22, 23, 26, and 29.

Now, we will check the connections between these degree-3 nodes to see if they form 3-stars. Counting the number of unique 3-stars will give us the final answer inside brackets.

1. <0, (2, 12, 29)>
2. <5, (6, 14, 16)>
3. <11, (6, 23, 10)>
4. <15, (3, 6, 25)>
5. <22, (2, 19, 25)>
6. <23, (9, 11, 24)>
7. <26, (4, 16, 28)>
8. <29, (0, 8, 19)>
