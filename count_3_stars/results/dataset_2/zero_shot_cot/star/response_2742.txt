Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected in the specific way required for a 3-star. Given that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them based on the given edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 5), (6, 7)  <6, (9, 5, 7)>
2. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1)  <9, (6, 3, 1)>
3. Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8)  <4, (6, 7, 8)>
4. Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 4), (7, 0)  <7, (6, 4, 0)>
5. Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 0)  <8, (4, 2, 0)>
6. Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 0)  <5, (6, 7, 0)>
7. Node 2: (2, 8), (2, 3)  No 3-star around node 2.
8. Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 8)  <0, (9, 7, 8)>
9. Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 8)  <1, (9, 7, 8)>
10. Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 4)  <3, (6, 9, 4)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (9, 5, 7)>, <9, (6, 3, 1)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <7, (6, 4, 0)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>, <5, (6, 7, 0)>, <0, (9, 7, 8)>, <1, (9, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 9, 4)>.
