Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 16) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 16) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 5) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 16) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (4, 6) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form each 3-star in the graph:

1. (9, 6, 4)
2. (2, 9, 17)
3. (17, 9, 4)
4. (3, 11, 19)
5. (1, 15, 5)
6. (0, 10, 18)
7. (12, 14, 19)
8. (13, 11, 0)
9. (8, 15, 5)
10. (16, 9, 13)

Now, let's count how many times each unique 3-star appears:
- (9, 6, 4) appears once
- (2, 9, 17) appears once
- (17, 9, 4) appears once
- (3, 11, 19) appears once
- (1, 15, 5) appears once
- (0, 10, 18) appears once
- (12, 14, 19) appears once
- (13, 11, 0) appears once
- (8, 15, 5) appears once
- (16, 9, 13) appears once

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 

Listing the 3-stars found:
<<9, 6, 4>, <2, 9, 17>, <17, 9, 4>, <3, 11, 19>, <1, 15, 5>, <0, 10, 18>, <12, 14, 19>, <13, 11, 0>, <8, 15, 5>, <16, 9, 13>>
