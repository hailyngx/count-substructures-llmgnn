Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 2) (21, 14) (12, 27) (12, 6) (27, 12) (27, 17) (27, 1) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 13) (2, 21) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 25) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 22) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 3) (11, 21) (28, 13) (28, 25) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 10) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 10) (19, 8) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 22) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 17) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 24) (26, 0) (26, 23) (26, 3) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 5) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 14) (1, 27) (1, 29) (1, 5) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 13) (9, 0) (9, 25) (25, 2) (25, 28) (25, 9) (3, 18) (3, 26) (3, 24) (17, 27) (17, 16) (17, 23) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 14) (6, 12) (6, 2) (14, 21) (14, 4) (14, 23) (14, 13) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. From the given edges, we can identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star:
   - Nodes with degree 3: 21, 2, 8, 4, 18, 29, 10, 19, 16, 5, 26, 22, 23, 1, 24, 13, and 14.

2. Identify the 3-stars by iterating over the nodes with degree 3 and checking their neighbors to form 3-stars.

The final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<7, (21, 8, 11)>
<12, (27, 6, 17)>
<0, (20, 16, 9)>
<20, (0, 13, 16)>
<27, (12, 17, 1)>
<18, (4, 19, 3)>
