Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 18) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 0) (0, 8) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 18) (19, 15) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 18) (2, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 11) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three adjacent nodes for each 3-star. Let's start by checking the connectivity of each node:

Node 0: connected to nodes 8, 17, 16
Node 1: connected to nodes 7, 2, 14, 12
Node 2: connected to node 1
Node 3: connected to nodes 15, 6, 9, 12
Node 4: connected to nodes 15, 7, 9
Node 5: connected to node 8
Node 6: connected to nodes 3, 18
Node 7: connected to nodes 4, 1, 17, 8
Node 8: connected to nodes 5, 13, 11, 0, 7
Node 9: connected to nodes 3, 4, 16, 11
Node 10: connected to node 13
Node 11: connected to nodes 8, 9, 14
Node 12: connected to nodes 3, 1, 16, 18
Node 13: connected to nodes 8, 10, 17, 18
Node 14: connected to nodes 1, 11
Node 15: connected to nodes 3, 19, 4
Node 16: connected to nodes 0, 12, 18, 9
Node 17: connected to nodes 7, 13, 0
Node 18: connected to nodes 13, 16, 12, 6

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in this graph:
1. <0, (8, 17, 16)>
2. <1, (7, 2, 14)>
3. <1, (7, 12, 17)>
4. <2, (1, 7, 14)>
5. <3, (15, 6, 9)>
6. <3, (15, 4, 9)>
7. <4, (15, 7, 4)>
8. <8, (5, 13, 11)>
9. <12, (3, 1, 18)>
10. <13, (8, 10, 17)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
