Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 19) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 13) (27, 11) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 6) (6, 27) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 3) (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 24) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 10) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 2) (12, 21) (1, 6) (1, 29) (1, 4) (26, 18) (26, 14) (26, 0) (0, 26) (0, 10) (0, 17) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 26) (14, 4) (28, 3) (28, 23) (3, 9) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 17) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 22) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 24) (7, 25) (7, 3) (10, 20) (10, 0) (10, 8) (2, 25) (2, 21) (17, 0) (17, 3) (17, 24) (17, 4) (29, 1) (29, 13) (29, 23) (19, 16) (23, 15) (23, 28) (23, 29) (23, 13) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 17) (8, 20) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 29) (13, 23) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 17) (22, 21) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph based on the description you've provided.

First, let's list out the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 1: [6, 29, 4]
- Node 2: [25, 21]
- Node 3: [9, 28, 7, 17]
- Node 4: [1, 14, 17]
- Node 5: [9, 18, 24]
- Node 6: [27, 9, 1, 14]
- Node 7: [25, 3]
- Node 8: [20, 10]
- Node 9: [6, 5, 24, 3]
- Node 10: [20, 0, 8]
- Node 11: [16, 14, 27]
- Node 12: [21]
- Node 13: [16, 15, 29, 23]
- Node 14: [11, 6, 26, 4]
- Node 15: [27, 13, 23]
- Node 16: [11, 13, 19]
- Node 17: [0, 3, 24, 4]
- Node 18: [5, 26, 24]
- Node 19: [16]
- Node 20: [27, 25, 8, 10]
- Node 21: [2, 22, 12]
- Node 22: [21]
- Node 23: [15, 28, 29, 13]
- Node 24: [9, 5, 18, 17]
- Node 25: [20, 7, 2]
- Node 26: [18, 14, 0]
- Node 27: [11, 15, 20, 6]
- Node 28: [3, 23]
- Node 29: [1, 23, 13]

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <1, (6, 29, 4)>
- <3, (9, 28, 7)>
- <5, (9, 18, 24)>
- <6, (27, 9, 1)>
- <11, (16, 14, 27)>
- <13, (16, 15, 29)>
- <14, (11, 6, 26)>
- <15, (27, 13, 23)>
- <16, (11, 13, 19)>
- <17, (0, 3, 24)>
- <18, (5, 26, 24)>
- <20, (27, 25, 8)>
- <21, (2, 22, 12)>
- <23, (15, 28, 29)>
- <24, (9, 5, 18)>
- <25, (20, 7, 2)>
- <26, (18, 14, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
