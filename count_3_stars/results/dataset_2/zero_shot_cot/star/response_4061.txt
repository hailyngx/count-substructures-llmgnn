Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 2) (4, 12) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 3) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes connected by edges. 

Let's list the 3-stars:

<5, (9, 8, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 10)>
<6, (9, 3, 11)>
<10, (9, 5, 14)>
<11, (6, 10, 1)>
<4, (12, 13, 5)>
<8, (5, 1, 7)>
<0, (6, 3, 1)>
<7, (9, 8, 14)>
<12, (5, 4, 3)>
<14, (10, 7, 3)>
<3, (6, 0, 7)>
<1, (11, 8, 0)>
<2, (9, 11, 3)>
<13, (9, 4, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
