Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each node with exactly three neighbors connected to it.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 2)
2. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 4)
3. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 5)
4. Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 7)
5. Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 1)
6. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8)
7. Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 4)
8. Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 8)
9. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5)
10. Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0)

Hence, each of the 10 nodes forms a 3-star with its neighbors. So, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [(10)].
