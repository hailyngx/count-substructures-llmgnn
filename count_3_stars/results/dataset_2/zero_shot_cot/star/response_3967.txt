Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 17) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 3) (0, 27) (0, 24) (0, 12) (0, 23) (18, 7) (18, 29) (18, 13) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 29) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 14) (20, 25) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 16) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 13) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (28, 11) (28, 23) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 8) (1, 5) (1, 19) (17, 26) (17, 2) (24, 26) (24, 0) (24, 4) (29, 27) (29, 18) (29, 22) (13, 15) (13, 18) (13, 21) (13, 12) (8, 11) (8, 19) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 6) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 14) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 17) (2, 14) (10, 22) (10, 16) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 16) (23, 9) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 6) (16, 25) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars.

For each node, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If it is, we will list the 3-star containing that node.
After analyzing all the nodes, we will count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Here are the 3-stars found:
<0, (12, 24, 27)>
<1, (5, 19, 22)>
<2, (14, 17, 4)>
<3, (14, 25, 27)>
<4, (12, 14, 24)>
<5, (1, 16, 22)>
<6, (16, 19, 23)>
<7, (13, 15, 21)>
<8, (11, 19, 28)>
<9, (23, 26, 27)>
<10, (16, 22, 16)>
<11, (8, 19, 28)>
<13, (12, 18, 15)>
<14, (2, 3, 4)>
<15, (7, 13, 27)>
<16, (5, 6, 10)>
<17, (2, 26, 17)>
<18, (13, 18, 29)>
<19, (1, 6, 8)>
<22, (1, 5, 10)>
<23, (6, 9, 28)>
<24, (0, 4, 26)>
<25, (3, 16, 20)>
<26, (9, 17, 24)>
<27, (0, 15, 29)>
<28, (8, 11, 23)>
<29, (18, 22, 27)>

Finally, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
