Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 19) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 1) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 2) (1, 0) (1, 26) (3, 21) (3, 14) (3, 20) (3, 4) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 5) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 25) (12, 6) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 8) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 10) (15, 20) (20, 3) (20, 22) (20, 15) (17, 25) (17, 4) (17, 7) (29, 12) (29, 8) (29, 21) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 28) (28, 21) (2, 27) (2, 23) (2, 14) (8, 12) (8, 29) (8, 10) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 11) (26, 16) (11, 23) (11, 26) (16, 0) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 7) (25, 22) (25, 17) (25, 5) (5, 18) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 14) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 24) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 17) (10, 6) (10, 23) (10, 8) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 6, as it will be the center of the 3-stars.

From the given edges, we find:
- Nodes connected to node 6: 10, 18, 12, 13

Now, we can find the 3-stars that have node 6 as the center along with the leaves connected to it.

The 3-stars are:
<6, (10, 12, 18)>
<6, (12, 13, 18)>
<6, (10, 12, 23)>
<6, (10, 13, 7)>
<6, (12, 13, 7)>

So, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [5].
