Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in this graph.

1. Central node = 5
   Leaves = 6, 2, 8
   <5, (6, 2, 8)>

2. Central node = 9
   Leaves = 8, 1, 7
   <9, (8, 1, 7)>

3. Central node = 4
   Leaves = 7, 0, 1
   <4, (7, 0, 1)>

4. Central node = 7
   Leaves = 9, 4, 0
   <7, (9, 4, 0)>

5. Central node = 1
   Leaves = 9, 4, 7
   <1, (9, 4, 7)>

6. Central node = 0
   Leaves = 9, 4, 7
   <0, (9, 4, 7)>

7. Central node = 6
   Leaves = 5, 4, 3
   <6, (5, 4, 3)>

8. Central node = 2
   Leaves = 5, 4, 1
   <2, (5, 4, 1)>

9. Central node = 8
   Leaves = 5, 9, 1
   <8, (5, 9, 1)>

10. Central node = 3
    Leaves = 6, 4, 0
    <3, (6, 4, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
