Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-star graphs step-by-step:

1. Node 1:
<1, (6, 7, 10)>
<1, (6, 7, 11)>
<1, (6, 10, 11)>
<1, (7, 10, 11)>
Total: 4

2. Node 2:
<2, (10, 1, 3)>
Total: 1

3. Node 3:
<3, (11, 2, 13)>
Total: 1

4. Node 4:
<4, (9, 7, 10)>
<4, (9, 7, 14)>
<4, (9, 10, 14)>
<4, (7, 10, 14)>
Total: 4

5. Node 5:
<5, (0, 14, 13)>
Total: 1

6. Node 6:
<6, (1, 7, 10)>
Total: 1

7. Node 8:
<8, (9, 11, 0)>
<8, (9, 11, 12)>
Total: 2

8. Node 9:
<9, (4, 11, 14)>
<9, (4, 10, 11)>
<9, (4, 10, 14)>
<9, (10, 11, 14)>
Total: 4

10. Node 12:
<12, (10, 11, 14)>
<12, (10, 11, 8)>
<12, (10, 14, 13)>
<12, (11, 14, 13)>
Total: 4

11. Node 13:
<13, (14, 3, 12)>
Total: 1

12. Node 14:
<14, (9, 4, 0)>
<14, (9, 4, 12)>
<14, (9, 10, 11)>
<14, (9, 10, 12)>
Total: 4
