Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph.

1. For node 3 as the center:
   - <3, (15, 9, 4)>
   - <3, (15, 2, 14)>
   - <3, (9, 6, 4)>
   - <3, (14, 12, 1)>

2. For node 6 as the center:
   - <6, (9, 12, 13)>
   - <6, (9, 12, 7)>
   - <6, (12, 7, 5)>

3. For node 9 as the center:
   - <9, (3, 6, 4)>
   - <9, (6, 12, 7)>
   - <9, (6, 12, 21)>
   - <9, (6, 13, 2)>
   - <9, (8, 28, 18)>

4. For node 12 as the center:
   - <12, (6, 9, 13)>
   - <12, (6, 7, 5)>
   - <12, (12, 14, 21)>
   - <12, (12, 14, 22)>

5. For node 2 as the center:
   - <2, (15, 29, 26)>
   - <2, (15, 2, 13)>
   
6. For node 29 as the center:
   - <29, (2, 16, 10)>

7. For node 28 as the center:
   - <28, (9, 18, 8)>

   - <7, (12, 5, 1)>

9. For node 1 as the center:
   - <1, (7, 25, 14)>
   
10. For node 16 as the center:
   - <16, (29, 10, 21)>

11. For node 8 as the center:
   - <8, (9, 18, 28)>

12. For node 10 as the center:
   - <10, (16, 21, 22)>
   - <10, (25, 21, 5)>

13. For node 21 as the center:
   - <21, (12, 10, 4)>
   - <21, (12, 10, 22)>

14. For node 25 as the center:
   - <25, (26, 1, 27)>
   - <25, (10, 21, 5)>

15. For node 26 as the center:
   - <26, (2, 25, 11)>
   
16. For node 0 as the center:
   - <0, (11, 23, 24)>

17. For node 13 as the center:
   - <13, (6, 2, 13)>

18. For node 11 as the center:
   - <11, (26, 27, 0)>

19. For node 19 as the center:
   - <19, (17, 20, 23)>

20. For node 24 as the center:
   - <24, (1, 23, 0)>

21. For node 4 as the center:
   - <4, (3, 9, 21)>

22. For node 20 as the center:
   - <20, (19, 23, 0)>
