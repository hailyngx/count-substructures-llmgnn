Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 17) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 17) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 10) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 13) (0, 11) (0, 16) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 3) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 3) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 2) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps we'll follow:

1. Identify nodes with three neighbors each. These nodes will be the centers of 3-stars.
2. For each identified center node, list the three neighboring nodes to form a 3-star.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 11 has neighbors: 16, 19, 0
- Node 16 has neighbors: 11, 0, 7
- Node 12 has neighbors: 7, 6, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 14, 15
- Node 8 has neighbors: 4, 10, 15
- Node 2 has neighbors: 9, 14, 15

2. Unique 3-stars:
- <11, (16, 19, 0)>
- <16, (11, 0, 7)>
- <6, (9, 14, 15)>
- <8, (4, 10, 15)>
- <2, (9, 14, 15)>

3. Total number of 3-stars = 5

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
