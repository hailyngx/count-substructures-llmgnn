Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 18) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (10, 16) (10, 8) (17, 6) (17, 15) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to form the 3-stars. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. 

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 5, 9, 10, 6, 1, 3, 4, 17.

Now let's find the 3-stars by checking all the possible combinations involving these center nodes:

<5, (9, 8, 12)>
<9, (5, 8, 18)>
<10, (16, 8, 11)>
<6, (17, 7, 15)>
<1, (19, 0, 11)>
<3, (0, 18, 15)>
<4, (7, 13, 14)>
<17, (6, 15, 18)>

So, we have found 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
