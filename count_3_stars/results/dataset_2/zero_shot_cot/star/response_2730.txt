Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze each node:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 8, 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, 8. <0, (1, 8, 9)>
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, 5. <1, (4, 5, 9)>
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 7, 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, 5. <2, (4, 5, 7)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 6. It forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4, 5. <3, (4, 5, 6)>
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, 8, 9. It forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 4, 8. <7, (4, 8, 9)>

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [5].
