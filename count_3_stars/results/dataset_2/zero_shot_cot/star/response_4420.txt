Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star can be any of the 10 nodes in the graph. Let's count the number of 3-stars centered at each node:

- Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 9) => 2
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 7) => 4
- Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8) => 6
- Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4) => 6
- Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2) => 4
- Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7) => 3
- Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0) => 3
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 2), (7, 5) => 5
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 2) => 4
- Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 0) => 3

[There are a total of <0, (6, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)> 3-stars in the given graph.]
