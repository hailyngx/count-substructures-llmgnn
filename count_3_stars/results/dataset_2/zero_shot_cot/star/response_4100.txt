Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 10) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 6 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 9, 1, 4.
- Node 9 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 6, 2, 1.
- Node 1 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 6, 9, 14.
- Node 12 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 6, 5, 0.
- Node 4 is the center of the 3-star with leaves 6, 13, 14.

Therefore, there are a total of <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <9, (6, 2, 1)>, <1, (6, 9, 14)>, <12, (6, 5, 0)>, and <4, (6, 13, 14)> 3-stars in the given graph, for a total of [5].
