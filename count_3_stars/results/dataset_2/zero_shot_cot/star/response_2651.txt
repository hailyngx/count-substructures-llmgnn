Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying 3-star patterns. 

From the given edge list, we see that the potential center nodes with degree 3 are: 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

We can now search for 3-stars around each of these potential center nodes.

1. Around node 1:
   - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
   - <1, (4, 6, 9)>
   (1 unique 3-star found)

2. Around node 4:
   - <4, (7, 1, 2)>
   - <4, (7, 1, 6)>
   (1 unique 3-star found)

3. Around node 6:
   - <6, (4, 7, 2)>
   - <6, (4, 1, 3)>
   (1 unique 3-star found)

4. Around node 8:
   - <8, (7, 3, 1)>
   (1 unique 3-star found)

5. Around node 9:
   - <9, (4, 7, 6)>
   - <9, (7, 0, 6)>
   (2 unique 3-stars found)

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6] <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 1, 2)>, <4, (7, 1, 6)>, <6, (4, 7, 2)>, <9, (4, 7, 6)>.
