Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 19) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 23) (8, 25) (8, 7) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 21) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 21) (6, 5) (6, 24) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 4) (9, 10) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 1) (22, 9) (22, 2) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 0) (13, 27) (26, 23) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 20) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 19) (24, 6) (2, 22) (2, 26) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 25) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 27) (0, 3) (0, 13) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 16) (21, 11) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 20) (25, 11) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 19) (12, 5) (12, 17) (16, 18) (16, 20) (27, 28) (27, 13) (27, 7) (17, 23) (17, 12) (17, 4) (4, 28) (4, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the steps we can follow:
1. Identify all nodes in the graph that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, count the number of unique 3-star configurations they form.

Let's go through each step and determine the count.

Step 1:
Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: 3, 10, 11, 15, 22

Step 2:
- For node 3: (3, 0, 13), (3, 7, 8), (3, 14, 18), (3, 15, 19) => <3, (0, 13, 7, 8, 14, 18, 15, 19)>
- For node 10: (10, 9, 22), (10, 11, 21), (10, 23, 8) => <10, (9, 22, 11, 21, 23, 8)>
- For node 11: (11, 10, 25), (11, 21, 5), (11, 25, 8) => <11, (10, 25, 21, 5, 8)>
- For node 15: (15, 3, 19) => <15, (3, 19)>
- For node 22: (22, 9, 2) => <22, (9, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is:
