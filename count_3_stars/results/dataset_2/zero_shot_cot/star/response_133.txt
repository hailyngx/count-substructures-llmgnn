Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 13) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the unique occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Based on the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<5, (1, 10, 11)>
<10, (3, 6, 11)>
<11, (1, 5, 10)>
<7, (2, 8, 13)>
<12, (0, 1, 14)>
<2, (1, 7, 14)>
<8, (0, 3, 7)>
<0, (6, 12, 14)>
<14, (0, 2, 10)>
<3, (8, 10, 14)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 10)>
<13, (7, 9, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(13)].
