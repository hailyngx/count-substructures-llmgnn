Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 12) (21, 18) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (22, 16) (22, 15) (22, 7) (23, 11) (23, 20) (23, 27) (5, 6) (5, 28) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 20) (26, 7) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 12) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 2) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 11) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 11) (27, 23) (7, 9) (7, 22) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 28) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 8) (16, 22) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 17) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 24) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 15) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 24) (10, 29) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 10) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 20) (20, 23) (20, 26) (20, 2) (15, 22) (15, 28) (24, 17) (24, 10) (24, 29) (14, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (29, 10) (29, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <4, (2, 18, 25)>
2. <5, (6, 28, 26)>
3. <6, (9, 5, 10)>
4. <7, (9, 22, 25)>
5. <9, (6, 7, 18)>
6. <10, (6, 12, 24)>
7. <11, (13, 19, 18)>
8. <12, (1, 10, 19)>
9. <15, (22, 28, 26)>
10. <16, (22, 7, 17)>
11. <17, (25, 16, 24)>
12. <18, (21, 9, 4)>
13. <19, (26, 13, 11)>
14. <20, (23, 2, 26)>
15. <22, (16, 15, 7)>
16. <24, (10, 17, 29)>
17. <25, (4, 7, 28)>
18. <26, (1, 20, 19)>
19. <28, (5, 25, 15)>
20. <29, (10, 24, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
