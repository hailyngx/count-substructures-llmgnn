Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 5) (13, 19) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 4) (17, 7) (8, 15) (8, 11) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 17) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) (9, 2) (9, 16) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (16, 9) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 3) (18, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (4, 12, 18)>
<1, (2, 6, 11)>
<2, (1, 9, 17)>
<3, (1, 10, 15)>
<4, (0, 10, 14)>
<5, (6, 10, 12)>
<7, (15, 17, 19)>
<8, (11, 15, 8)>
<13, (14, 19, 13)>
<16, (9, 16, 0)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [10].
