Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 3) (8, 11) (8, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 14) (2, 15) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 19) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 15) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 18) (1, 0) (1, 16) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 11) (11, 8) (11, 18) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 16) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 14) (15, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (4, 3, 1)>
<1, (0, 16, 18)>
<3, (10, 17, 0)>
<4, (7, 5, 0)>
<5, (18, 15, 7)>
<6, (7, 14, 17)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<9, (14, 10, 19)>
<10, (9, 3, 12)>
<12, (8, 15, 10)>
<13, (16, 9, 18)>
<14, (9, 6, 15)>
<15, (5, 16, 14)>
<16, (1, 13, 15)>
<18, (5, 13, 1)>
<19, (9, 0, 16)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
