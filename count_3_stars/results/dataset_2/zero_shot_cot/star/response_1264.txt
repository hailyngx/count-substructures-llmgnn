Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 14) (11, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 19) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 19) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 17) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 19) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 19) (7, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's list down all such 3-stars in the graph:

<13, (1, 5, 6)>
<6, (10, 15, 19)>
<3, (0, 12, 17)>
<0, (16, 19, 3)>
<19, (0, 6, 7)>
<14, (9, 10, 11)>
<15, (5, 6, 18)>
<4, (2, 3, 15)>

Now, to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to count the unique 3-stars from the above list. The final answer is [8].
