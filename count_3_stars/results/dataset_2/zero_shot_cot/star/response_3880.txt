Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which could potentially form 3-stars.

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 0, 5, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 5, 1, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 2, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 2, and 0.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9.

Next, let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<4, (8, 0, 5)>
<4, (8, 5, 2)> 
<7, (6, 1, 8)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (9, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (6, 7, 4)>
<6, (3, 1, 7)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 8, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
