Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 4) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with exactly 3 edges. These nodes are potential centers of 3-star graphs. 

The nodes with exactly 3 edges are: 0, 2, 8, 9, 10, 12.

Next, we will check each potential center to see if it forms a 3-star.

For node 0:
- (0, 7), (0, 11), (0, 5) form a 3-star: <0, (7, 11, 5)>

For node 2:
- (2, 13), (2, 3) do not form a 3-star

For node 8:
- (8, 5), (8, 6) do not form a 3-star

For node 9:
- (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 4) form a 3-star: <9, (3, 7, 4)>

For node 10:
- (10, 5), (10, 4), (10, 12) form a 3-star: <10, (5, 4, 12)>

For node 12:
- (12, 4), (12, 10), (12, 6) form a 3-star: <12, (4, 10, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <0, (7, 11, 5)>, <9, (3, 7, 4)>, <10, (5, 4, 12)>, <12, (4, 10, 6)>
