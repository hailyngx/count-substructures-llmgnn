Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will examine each node as a potential central node of a 3-star and see if it satisfies the definition.

Let's go through each node:
- Node 0: Not a central node of a 3-star because it is connected to only 2 other nodes (1 and 6).
- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 4: <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 6: Not a central node of a 3-star because it is connected to only 2 other nodes (0 and 3).
- Node 7: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 9: Not a central node of a 3-star because it is connected to only 2 other nodes (2 and 4).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, and <7, (2, 4, 8)>.

There are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
