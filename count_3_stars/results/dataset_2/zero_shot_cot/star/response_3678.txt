Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes connected by edges.

1. Central Node 5:
   <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (7, 14, 9)>

2. Central Node 9:
   <9, (4, 10, 14)>, <9, (13, 14, 10)>

3. Central Node 8:
   <8, (2, 12, 4)>, <8, (12, 13, 2)>

4. Central Node 13:
   <13, (3, 11, 9)>, <13, (14, 8, 11)>

5. Central Node 10:
   <10, (2, 3, 9)>, <10, (11, 14, 3)>

6. Central Node 11:
   <11, (3, 7, 10)>, <11, (12, 13, 7)>

7. Central Node 4:
   <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>

8. Central Node 6:
   <6, (4, 7, 0)>

9. Central Node 2:
   <2, (4, 8, 10)>

10. Central Node 3:
   <3, (0, 10, 13)>, <3, (11, 14, 10)>

11. Central Node 0:
   <0, (1, 3, 4)>

12. Central Node 7:
   <7, (5, 6, 11)>

13. Central Node 1:
   <1, (0, 5, 12)>

14. Central Node 14:
   <14, (3, 9, 13)>

15. Central Node 12:
   <12, (1, 11, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
