Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 9) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (15, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 0) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 6) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 2) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 12) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 19) (10, 12) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 16.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 15, 13, and 9.
3. Node 13 is connected to nodes 17, 19, and 0.
4. Node 17 is connected to nodes 6, 5, and 7.
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 16, 3, and 6.
6. Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 5, and 12.
7. Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 5.
8. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 19.
9. Node 12 is connected to nodes 18, 11, and 19.
10. Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 17, and 11.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
There are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (9, 5, 16)>
<1, (15, 13, 9)>
<13, (17, 19, 0)>
<17, (6, 5, 7)>
<7, (16, 3, 6)>
<11, (14, 5, 12)>
<14, (2, 11, 5)>
<2, (3, 6, 19)>
<12, (18, 11, 19)>
<5, (4, 17, 11)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
