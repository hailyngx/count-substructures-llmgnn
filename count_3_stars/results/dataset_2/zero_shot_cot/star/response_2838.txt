Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 10) (15, 27) (15, 10) (27, 15) (27, 14) (27, 17) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 11) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 29) (0, 20) (0, 28) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 24) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 16) (12, 2) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 29) (26, 4) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 18) (17, 27) (17, 20) (17, 1) (21, 13) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 15) (10, 19) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 24) (16, 13) (16, 6) (16, 28) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 9) (14, 27) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 2) (3, 20) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 22) (4, 26) (4, 9) (4, 24) (25, 18) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 4) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 14) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 2) (29, 13) (29, 8) (29, 23) (29, 26) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 4) (9, 18) (18, 1) (18, 25) (18, 9) (19, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 

The possible 3-stars can be deduced from the provided edges:
- (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10)
- (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 10)
- (15, 27) (15, 10)
- (27, 14) (27, 17)
- (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 11)
- (0, 20) (0, 28)
- (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 24)
- (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 14)
- (6, 16)
- (12, 2)
- (26, 29)
- (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 18)
- (21, 13)
- (10, 19)

Counting the 3-stars from the identified nodes:
1. <13, (21, 16, 29)>
2. <22, (26, 4, 5)>
3. <15, (27, 10, 14)>
4. <8, (23, 29, 11)>
5. <0, (20, 28, 17)>
6. <20, (17, 3, 24)>
7. <5, (22, 6, 3)>
8. <26, (29, 4, 2)>
9. <1, (17, 9, 18)>
10. <10, (13, 22, 15)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
