Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 19) (9, 12) (26, 22) (26, 21) (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 22) (21, 26) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 5) (2, 0) (2, 19) (2, 7) (29, 23) (29, 15) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 27) (3, 8) (3, 18) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 0) (4, 16) (4, 25) (4, 20) (18, 3) (0, 2) (0, 17) (22, 26) (22, 1) (22, 27) (22, 8) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 7) (28, 14) (28, 24) (7, 2) (7, 28) (7, 25) (7, 15) (7, 13) (25, 17) (25, 4) (25, 7) (11, 13) (11, 15) (23, 29) (23, 19) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 13) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 20) (8, 3) (8, 22) (8, 28) (8, 20) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 19) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 23) (19, 24) (15, 29) (15, 7) (15, 11) (27, 3) (27, 22) (5, 21) (20, 4) (20, 16) (20, 8) (20, 13) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 20) (14, 9) (14, 28) (14, 24) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by finding the nodes that form 3-stars. Since a 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes, we need to find all the combinations of nodes that satisfy this condition.

First, let's list out the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 17
- Node 1: 21, 3, 6, 22
- Node 2: 19, 7, 0
- Node 3: 9, 1, 27, 8, 18
- Node 4: 16, 25, 20
- Node 5: 21
- Node 6: 1, 17, 13
- Node 7: 2, 28, 25, 15, 13
- Node 8: 3, 22, 28, 20
- Node 9: 14, 3, 19, 12
- Node 11: 13, 15
- Node 12: 9, 16
- Node 13: 7, 11, 6, 20
- Node 14: 9, 28, 24
- Node 15: 29, 7, 11
- Node 16: 4, 12, 20
- Node 17: 25, 6, 0
- Node 18: 3
- Node 19: 9, 2, 23, 24
- Node 20: 4, 16, 8, 13
- Node 21: 26, 1, 28, 5
- Node 22: 26, 1, 27, 8
- Node 23: 29, 19
- Node 24: 28, 14, 19
- Node 25: 17, 4, 7
- Node 26: 22, 21
- Node 27: 3, 22
- Node 28: 21, 8, 7, 14, 24
- Node 29: 23, 15

Next, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
