Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 4) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 18) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 15) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 12) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 3) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 3) (13, 7) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 19) (19, 6) (19, 17) (19, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Start by listing all nodes with their degree (number of edges connected to each node):
    - Node 0: degree 2
    - Node 1: degree 1
    - Node 2: degree 3
    - Node 3: degree 4
    - Node 4: degree 5
    - Node 5: degree 2
    - Node 6: degree 3
    - Node 7: degree 3
    - Node 8: degree 3
    - Node 9: degree 2
    - Node 10: degree 3
    - Node 11: degree 3
    - Node 12: degree 4
    - Node 13: degree 2
    - Node 14: degree 3
    - Node 15: degree 3
    - Node 16: degree 4
    - Node 17: degree 4
    - Node 18: degree 4
    - Node 19: degree 3

2. Identify nodes with degree 3. These nodes can be the centers of 3-stars. Nodes 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 19 have degree 3.

3. For each of these nodes, check the nodes they are connected to. If there are exactly three connections, we have found a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars in the graph: 
- For Node 2: 
    - <2, (9, 3, 4)>

- For Node 6: 
    - <6, (16, 13, 19)>

- For Node 7: 
    - <7, (4, 13, 8)>

- For Node 8: 
    - <8, (4, 12, 7)>

- For Node 10: 
    - <10, (4, 17, 16)>

- For Node 11: 
    - <11, (0, 12, 14)>

- For Node 14: 
    - <14, (4, 0, 11)>

- For Node 15: 
    - <15, (12, 18, 5)>

- For Node 19: 
    - <19, (6, 17, 3)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
