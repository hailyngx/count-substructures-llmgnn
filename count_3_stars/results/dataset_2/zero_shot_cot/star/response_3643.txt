Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, as these nodes can be the center of a 3-star graph. 

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 2, 8, and 7.

Next, we will find all possible 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

For node 2:
- <2, (5, 8, 3)>

For node 8:
- <8, (4, 2, 1)>

For node 7:
- <7, (9, 0, 1)>

Hence, there are three unique 3-star graphs in total. Therefore, the answer is [3].
