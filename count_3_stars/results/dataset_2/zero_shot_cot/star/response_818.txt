Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 19) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 12) (12, 3) (12, 13) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 18) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 11) (17, 2) (19, 15) (19, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 19) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Looking at the edges, we can find the 3-stars by checking the nodes that are connected to a central node by exactly three edges.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<11, (10, 16, 18)>
<16, (2, 11, 17)>
<3, (5, 9, 12)>
<15, (19, 10, 16)>
<4, (7, 9, 2)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<10, (6, 11, 16)>
<8, (5, 13, 18)>
<13, (12, 8, 3)>
<12, (3, 13, 12)>
<0, (1, 14, 18)>
<14, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (10, 14, 18)>
<1, (0, 14, 18)>
<17, (2, 11, 17)>
<19, (9, 15, 10)>

There are a total of 17 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [17].
