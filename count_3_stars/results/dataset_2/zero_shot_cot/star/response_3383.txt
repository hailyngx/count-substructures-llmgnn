Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 5) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 15) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15) (19, 15) (19, 0) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 19) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 19) (3, 10) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 13) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by finding how many nodes are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
To find 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes by edges. This indicates the presence of a 3-star structure with that node as the center.

The nodes are connected in the following way with their respective neighbor count:
1 - 4 neighbors
2 - 3 neighbors
3 - 1 neighbor
4 - 3 neighbors
5 - 4 neighbors
6 - 5 neighbors
7 - 4 neighbors
8 - 3 neighbors
9 - 3 neighbors
10 - 4 neighbors
11 - 3 neighbors
12 - 3 neighbors
13 - 2 neighbors
14 - 3 neighbors
15 - 4 neighbors
16 - 2 neighbors
17 - 3 neighbors
18 - 2 neighbors
19 - 2 neighbors
Looking at the counts, nodes 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 19 are the nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes, and thus represent the centers of 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars present in the graph are:
<2, (1, 8, 15)>
<4, (6, 7, 14)>
<8, (2, 9, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<11, (16, 5, 1)>
<12, (7, 14, 13)>
<14, (4, 12, 13)>
<16, (11, 5, 15)>
<18, (6, 15, 17)>
<19, (15, 0, 0)>
