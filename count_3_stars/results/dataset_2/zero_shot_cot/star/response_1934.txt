Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 13) (6, 16) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 8) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 12) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 0) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 19) (8, 18) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 16) (19, 2) (19, 3) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique groups of a central node and three leaves.

Let's start by listing the nodes connected to each node:

Node 0: 13, 11, 3
Node 1: 17, 15
Node 2: 18, 19, 13
Node 3: 17, 0, 19
Node 4: 9, 17, 18, 14
Node 5: 9, 13, 12
Node 6: 9, 13, 16
Node 7: 13, 11
Node 8: 18
Node 9: 5, 6, 4
Node 10: 17, 16
Node 11: 17, 7, 0
Node 12: 5, 15, 14
Node 13: 5, 6, 2, 0, 7
Node 14: 4, 12, 16
Node 15: 1, 12
Node 16: 6, 10, 18, 14
Node 17: 10, 1, 3, 11, 4
Node 18: 2, 4, 16, 8
Node 19: 2, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (13, 11, 3)>
<1, (17, 15, 12)>
<2, (18, 19, 13)>
<3, (17, 0, 19)>
<4, (17, 18, 14)>
<5, (9, 13, 12)>
<6, (9, 13, 16)>
<7, (13, 11, 0)>
<8, (18, 4, 16)>
<9, (5, 6, 4)>
<10, (17, 16, 10)>
<11, (17, 7, 0)>
<12, (5, 15, 14)>
<13, (5, 6, 2)>
<14, (4, 12, 16)>
<15, (1, 12, 14)>
<16, (6, 10, 18)>
<17, (1, 3, 11)>
<18, (2, 16, 14)>
<19, (2, 3, 10)>

So, there are 20 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [20].
