Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 19) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 2) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 18) (1, 2) (3, 19) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 15) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (2, 5, 8)>
2. <4, (7, 9, 10)>
3. <6, (5, 14, 17)>
4. <10, (4, 13, 18)>
5. <12, (0, 13, 18)>
6. <15, (4, 16, 18)>
7. <16, (7, 15, 18)>
8. <18, (10, 12, 15)>
9. <19, (3, 8, 9)>
10. <7, (4, 16, 17)>
11. <13, (10, 12, 18)>
12. <14, (4, 6, 10)>
13. <17, (6, 11, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
