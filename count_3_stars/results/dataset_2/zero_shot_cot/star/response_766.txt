Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 21) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (1, 29) (1, 23) (21, 11) (21, 23) (21, 2) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 26) (8, 6) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 9) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 24) (19, 26) (26, 3) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 4) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 4) (28, 17) (28, 10) (28, 15) (5, 26) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 20) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 27) (20, 13) (20, 7) (20, 27) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 22) (25, 29) (25, 27) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 25) (22, 5) (22, 29) (22, 17) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 28) (17, 22) (24, 18) (24, 4) (24, 15) (15, 26) (15, 28) (15, 24) (9, 11) (9, 23) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 28) (14, 18) (4, 26) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 24) (12, 11) (12, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. In this case, the central node is considered the "center" of a 3-star and the nodes connected to it are the "leaves."

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<26, (3, 5, 15)>
<2, (21, 7, 10)>
<7, (0, 20, 27)>
<17, (16, 6, 22)>
<4, (26, 6, 24)>
<18, (2, 14, 24)>
<21, (11, 23, 2)>
<9, (11, 23, 0)>

Counting each unique 3-star found, we have a total of 8 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
