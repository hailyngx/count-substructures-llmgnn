Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's follow the definition of a 3-star graph.

Given Graph:
Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
Edges: 60

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 1, 10)>
<9, (6, 11, 10)>
<4, (5, 14, -)>
<7, (12, 3, 11)>
<8, (13, 5, 0)>
<13, (9, 7, 8)>
<12, (7, 8, 3)>
<0, (8, 3, 5)>
<14, (4, 13, 1)>
<2, (14, 5, 11)>
<1, (6, 13, 0)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars listed above. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
