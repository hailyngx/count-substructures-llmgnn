Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars we can find:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
