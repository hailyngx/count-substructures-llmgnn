Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 10) (6, 11) (18, 3) (18, 13) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 10) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 3) (13, 18) (13, 19) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (19, 13) (19, 16) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 14 since it has the highest degree in the graph. These are nodes 5, 8, and 17. 

Next, let's find the adjacent nodes to each of the nodes connected to node 14:
- For node 5: nodes 12 and 15
- For node 8: nodes 0, 1, 4, 15, and 16
- For node 17: nodes 1, 3, and 11

Now, let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:
<14, (5, 8, 17)>
<15, (4, 8, 9)>
<16, (0, 8, 19)>
<17, (1, 11, 3)>
<13, (18, 19, -)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found: [5]
