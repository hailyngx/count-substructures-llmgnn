Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 9) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 3) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 2) (7, 24) (7, 17) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 3) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 12) (10, 16) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 7) (17, 10) (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 4) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 25) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 28) (4, 3) (26, 5) (28, 4) (28, 8) (28, 20) (5, 26) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 20) (8, 16) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 8) (19, 22) (19, 23) (23, 19) (23, 25) (23, 3) (6, 10) (25, 14) (25, 23) (20, 28) (20, 13) (3, 27) (3, 18) (3, 4) (3, 23) (24, 7) (24, 0) (24, 12) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 24) (29, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where there is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars in this graph:

<11, (16, 0, 2)>
<16, (11, 29, 8)>
<27, (15, 18, 3)>
<21, (1, 10, 2)>
<18, (27, 22, 4)>
<22, (18, 19, 0)>
<10, (16, 21, 17)>
<17, (7, 10, 2)>
<2, (11, 21, 18)>
<0, (11, 22, 14)>
<14, (0, 25, -)>
<4, (18, 2, 28)>
<5, (26, 13, 8)>
<8, (16, 28, 5)>
<9, (16, 15, 8)>
<25, (14, 23, -)>
<20, (28, 13, -)>
<3, (27, 18, 23)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
