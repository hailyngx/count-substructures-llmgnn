Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 16) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 11) (6, 2) (9, 28) (9, 27) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 21) (11, 10) (11, 23) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 25) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 5) (28, 15) (29, 8) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 15) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 20) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 17) (3, 21) (3, 20) (23, 21) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 17) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 16) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 22) (24, 19) (24, 2) (22, 4) (22, 16) (5, 28) (5, 18) (5, 23) (5, 15) (13, 0) (13, 2) (20, 14) (20, 3) (20, 12) (20, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 24) (2, 13) (2, 20) (12, 10) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 26) (12, 19) (15, 4) (15, 28) (15, 29) (15, 5) (15, 26) (26, 12) (26, 15) (26, 27) (27, 9) (27, 14) (27, 26) (17, 18) (17, 23) (17, 12) (25, 8) (19, 24) (19, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding set of leaves. 

Looking at the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 16, 21)>
<2, (1, 13, 20)>
<4, (8, 15, 22)>
<5, (15, 18, 23)>
<7, (16, 18, 29)>
<8, (4, 15, 29)>
<9, (27, 28, 14)>
<10, (11, 12, 20)>
<11, (10, 21, 23)>
<12, (10, 17, 20)>
<15, (4, 5, 28)>
<16, (1, 7, 22)>
<17, (12, 17, 23)>
<18, (5, 7, 17)>
<19, (12, 24, 26)>
<20, (12, 14, 3)>
<21, (1, 3, 23)>
<22, (4, 16, 24)>
<23, (5, 11, 17)>
<24, (2, 19, 26)>
<26, (12, 15, 27)>
<27, (9, 14, 26)>
<28, (5, 9, 15)>
<29, (7, 8, 28)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of 24 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [24].
