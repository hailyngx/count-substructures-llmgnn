Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 2.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 4.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 3.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- <5, (1, 0, 3)>
- <9, (6, 8, 7)>
- <6, (9, 2, 4)>
- <1, (5, 3, 2)>
- <3, (5, 1, 7)>
- <4, (6, 7, 8)>
- <7, (9, 3, 4)>
- <8, (9, 1, 4)>
- <0, (5, 9, 8)>
- <2, (6, 1, 3)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars found in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [10].
