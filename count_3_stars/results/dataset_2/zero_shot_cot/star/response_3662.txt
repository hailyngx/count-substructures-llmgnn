Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 5) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. To be a central node of a 3-star, a node must have exactly three incident edges. Let's find those nodes by counting the number of incident edges for each node:

- Node 0: 2 incident edges
- Node 1: 6 incident edges
- Node 2: 2 incident edges
- Node 3: 3 incident edges
- Node 4: 4 incident edges
- Node 5: 4 incident edges
- Node 6: 4 incident edges
- Node 7: 4 incident edges
- Node 8: 4 incident edges
- Node 9: 5 incident edges
- Node 10: 4 incident edges
- Node 11: 2 incident edges
- Node 12: 6 incident edges
- Node 13: 4 incident edges
- Node 14: 6 incident edges

The nodes that have exactly three incident edges are nodes 3 and 9. These are the potential central nodes of 3-star configurations. Let's now find the possible 3-stars using nodes 3 and 9 as central nodes:

<3, (12, 10, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 14)>

Therefore, there are [2] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
