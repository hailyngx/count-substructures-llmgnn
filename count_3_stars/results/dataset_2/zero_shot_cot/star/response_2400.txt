Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 edges connected to it, indicating a 3-star structure.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 9, 4)>
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star
- Node 5 does not form a 3-star
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star
- Node 8 does not form a 3-star
- Node 9 does not form a 3-star
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (2, 6, 9)>

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
