Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 1) (16, 22) (16, 9) (10, 0) (10, 3) (8, 23) (8, 29) (8, 15) (8, 21) (23, 8) (23, 2) (23, 9) (2, 23) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 24) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 7) (28, 29) (28, 0) (28, 24) (29, 8) (29, 28) (29, 26) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 1) (26, 29) (26, 22) (22, 16) (22, 26) (22, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 5) (7, 18) (7, 27) (7, 9) (7, 13) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 13) (21, 8) (21, 12) (21, 17) (21, 14) (5, 18) (5, 0) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 17) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 9) (12, 22) (12, 21) (12, 20) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 9) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 20) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 4) (27, 7) (27, 3) (27, 20) (1, 16) (1, 19) (6, 11) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 3) (17, 2) (17, 21) (17, 4) (14, 19) (14, 21) (14, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down all the 3-stars below:

<0, (10, 5, 28)>
<1, (16, 19, 14)>
<2, (23, 18, 24)>
<3, (10, 13, 27)>
<4, (19, 14, 17)>
<5, (0, 18, 28)>
<7, (8, 13, 27)>
<9, (16, 23, 20)>
<11, (0, 6, 15)>
<12, (22, 21, 20)>
<15, (11, 8, 9)>
<16, (1, 22, 26)>
<18, (2, 5, 7)>
<19, (4, 1, 14)>
<20, (12, 27, 9)>
<21, (8, 12, 17)>
<22, (16, 12, 26)>
<24, (2, 4, 28)>
<26, (16, 22, 29)>
<27, (13, 3, 20)>
<28, (24, 0, 5)>
<29, (26, 8, 28)>

Therefore, there are a total of [22] 3-stars in the given graph.
