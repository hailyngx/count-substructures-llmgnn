Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 19) (12, 9) (27, 25) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 22) (20, 15) (20, 23) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 25) (6, 21) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 19) (21, 6) (21, 8) (17, 13) (17, 0) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 12) (19, 6) (19, 8) (13, 17) (13, 24) (8, 21) (8, 19) (8, 25) (8, 22) (8, 3) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 23) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 1) (1, 5) (1, 16) (1, 11) (10, 5) (9, 12) (9, 15) (9, 18) (9, 24) (18, 9) (18, 24) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 22) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 22) (14, 6) (0, 26) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 29) (2, 4) (4, 25) (4, 2) (29, 26) (29, 5) (29, 25) (29, 0) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 3) (22, 11) (22, 24) (23, 20) (23, 7) (23, 3) (24, 13) (24, 9) (24, 18) (24, 22) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 8 is connected to nodes 21, 19, 25, and 22.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 12, 15, 18, and 24.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 20, 9, and 22.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 28, 7, and 1.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 12, 6, and 8.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 15, 8, 3, and 24.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 13, 9, 18, and 22.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 27, 28, 8, 29, and 4.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 28, 29, and 0.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 26, 25, and 16.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 26, 5, 25, and 0.

Counting the number of 3-stars, we find the result to be [4]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (21, 19, 25)>
<9, (12, 15, 18)>
<15, (20, 9, 22)>
<22, (15, 8, 3)>
