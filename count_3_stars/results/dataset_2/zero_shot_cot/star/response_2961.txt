Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star.

Let's first identify the 3-stars:

<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<4, (6, 7, 2)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<5, (6, 1, )>

Next, we can count the number of unique 3-stars found:
[4]
