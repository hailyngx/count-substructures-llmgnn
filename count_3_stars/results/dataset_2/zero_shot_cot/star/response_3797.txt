Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 8) (3, 29) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (20, 1) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 18) (25, 20) (25, 15) (18, 22) (18, 20) (18, 8) (4, 8) (4, 27) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 4) (7, 11) (7, 20) (7, 12) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 15) (17, 11) (17, 29) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 29) (26, 28) (26, 24) (26, 14) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 24) (24, 26) (24, 28) (24, 21) (27, 4) (27, 7) (27, 28) (27, 21) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 5) (23, 10) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 6) (15, 25) (15, 12) (6, 29) (6, 23) (21, 22) (21, 24) (21, 27) (21, 14) (0, 10) (0, 26) (14, 26) (14, 23) (14, 21) (14, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 9) (9, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (3, 8, 20)>
<3, (1, 8, 29)>
<10, (2, 11, 23)>
<11, (2, 7, 17)>
<20, (1, 18, 25)>
<22, (13, 18, 21)>
<26, (0, 24, 28)>
<27, (4, 21, 28)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
