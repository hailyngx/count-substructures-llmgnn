Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to count the number of nodes that are connected by exactly three edges with a common central node.

Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 13)>
<1, (4, 9, 11)>
<2, (5, 7, 0)>
<3, (4, 6, 3)>
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<6, (10, 0, 14)>
<7, (4, 12, 11)>
<8, (9, 10, 11)>
<13, (12, 0, 14)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars identified above:
