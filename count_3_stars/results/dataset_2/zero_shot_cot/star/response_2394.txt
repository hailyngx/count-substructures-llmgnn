Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 10) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 13) (4, 13) (4, 1) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 16) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 11) (11, 3) (19, 0) (19, 16) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 18) (1, 16) (2, 9) (2, 5) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 16) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 1) (16, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. These nodes will act as centers of the 3-stars. Then, for each of these nodes, we find the nodes that are connected to them to form the 3-stars.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 1, 15, 9, 10, 18, 13, and 19.

By considering each of these nodes as the center of the 3-star, and listing the leaves, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (6, 7, 4)>
<15, (6, 9, 16)>
<9, (6, 2, 15)>
<10, (17, 12, 7)>
<18, (14, 16, 1)>
<13, (14, 4, 5)>
<19, (0, 16, 16)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 7 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [7].
