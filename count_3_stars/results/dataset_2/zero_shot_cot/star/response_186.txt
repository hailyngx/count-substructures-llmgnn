Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
The center node in a 3-star has exactly three edges connected to it. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- From node 5: <5, (9, 6, 8)>, <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- From node 9: <9, (5, 8, 3)>
- From node 4: <4, (7, 1, 0)>, <4, (7, 6, 0)>
- From node 7: <7, (4, 3, 2)>
- From node 6: <6, (5, 4, 3)>
- From node 2: <2, (7, 8, 3)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [6]
