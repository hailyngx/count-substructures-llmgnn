Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes and their corresponding leaves. 
From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (6, 2, 0)>
<9, (8, 7, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 2)>
<1, (6, 4, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<0, (5, 4, 1)>
<2, (5, 6, 4)>
<7, (9, 1)>
<8, (9, 6, 3)>
<4, (6, 1, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
