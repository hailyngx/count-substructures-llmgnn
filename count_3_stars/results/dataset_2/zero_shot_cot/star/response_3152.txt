Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<3, (9, 1, 6)>
<1, (9, 7, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
