Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, identify the nodes that are connected to the center in a star pattern. 
Then check if each potential 3-star meets the definition of a 3-star graph (one central node connected to exactly three other nodes). 
Finally, count the number of valid 3-stars.
The nodes connected to the center node 5 are 1, 0, and 8.
Potential 3-stars:
<5, (1, 0, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<4, (9, 8, 6)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>
<7, (3, 8, 6)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 8, 0)>
<0, (5, 6, 2)>
Count of 3-stars: [4]
