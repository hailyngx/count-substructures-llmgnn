Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:
1. Start with each node in the graph and identify its adjacent nodes.
2. For each node, check if it forms a 3-star pattern. A 3-star is formed if a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

Given the edges provided, let's find the unique 3-stars:

<0, (4, 8, 3)>  
<1, (9, 3, 2)>  
<2, (6, 1, 8)>  
<3, (4, 7, 9)>  
<4, (8, 0, 3)>  

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
