Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we first look for all nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Then we identify the neighbors of these nodes to form the 3-stars. 

Analyzing the given edges:
- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes (2, 8, 4, 3).
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes (3, 7, 0).
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (7, 2, 8).
- Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes (5, 0, 1, 3).
- Node 8 is connected to 5 other nodes (5, 6, 2, 7, 3).
- Node 2 is connected to 5 other nodes (5, 6, 8, 1, 7).
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes (9, 4, 1).
- Node 7 is connected to 5 other nodes (9, 6, 8, 2, 1).
- Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes (4, 2, 0, 7).
- Node 3 is connected to 5 other nodes (5, 9, 4, 8, 3).

The 3-star patterns are:
<5, (2, 8, 4)>
<9, (3, 7, 0)>
<4, (5, 0, 1)>
<8, (5, 6, 2)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>
<0, (9, 4, 1)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
