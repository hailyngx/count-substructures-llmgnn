Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to node 5, since it has the highest degree (5) in the graph. These nodes are 0, 3, 7, 8, and 9.
Next, we check if any of these nodes have exactly three edges incident to them, making them potential centers of 3-stars. Nodes 0, 3, 7, and 8 have 4 incident edges, so they are not centers.
Node 9 has exactly 3 incident edges (to nodes 5, 6, and 4), making it a potential center of a 3-star.

Now, let's construct all possible 3-stars with node 9 as the center:
1. <9, (5, 6, 4)>
2. <9, (5, 4, 1)>
3. <9, (5, 3, 1)>

Thus, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [3].
