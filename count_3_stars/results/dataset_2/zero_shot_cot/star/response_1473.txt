Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 14) (29, 2) (29, 26) (3, 25) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 15) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 13) (19, 13) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 4) (26, 17) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 15) (28, 4) (28, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (11, 18) (11, 8) (23, 24) (20, 7) (20, 14) (4, 26) (4, 16) (4, 28) (12, 24) (12, 22) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 22) (7, 8) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 21) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (15, 25) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 22) (21, 17) (21, 24) (13, 9) (13, 19) (24, 23) (24, 12) (24, 21) (24, 18) (24, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 27) (27, 6) (27, 14) (27, 10) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 27) (22, 6) (22, 12) (22, 7) (22, 15) (18, 28) (18, 11) (18, 0) (18, 24) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided.

The 3-stars can be represented by the following unique combinations:
<2, (29, 14, 26)>
<3, (25, 6, 9)>
<4, (26, 16, 28)>
<5, (16, 14, 5)>
<6, (9, 6, 27)>
<7, (25, 20, 8)>
<8, (26, 11, 0)>
<9, (6, 15, 1)>
<10, (1, 24, 27)>
<11, (18, 8, 11)>
<12, (24, 22, 12)>
<13, (19, 9, 13)>
<14, (2, 5, 27)>
<15, (25, 16, 22)>
<16, (4, 15, 5)>
<17, (26, 7, 21)>
<18, (28, 0, 11)>
<19, (13, 9, 19)>
<20, (7, 14, 20)>
<21, (17, 24, 21)>
<22, (6, 15, 22)>
<23, (24, 23)>
<24, (24, 12, 10)>
<25, (25, 3, 1)>
<26, (29, 26, 8)>
<27, (27, 6, 10)>
<28, (4, 18, 28)>
<29, (2, 26, 29)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

There are [28] unique 3-stars in the graph.
