Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
   - (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 3)

2. Node 1:
   - (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 7)

3. Node 2:
   - (2, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3)

4. Node 3:
   - (3, 5), (3, 9), (3, 7)

5. Node 4:
   - (4, 7), (4, 1)

6. Node 5:
   - (5, 9), (5, 3), (5, 7)

7. Node 6:
   - (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 0)

8. Node 7:
   - (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 1)

9. Node 8:
   - (8, 0)

10. Node 9:
   - (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Hence, the 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (6, 2, 3)>
<1, (6, 4, 7)>
<2, (6, 1, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (7, 1, 4)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>

So, there are [8] 3-stars in total.
