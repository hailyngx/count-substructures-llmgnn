Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 11) (8, 23) (8, 19) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 20) (23, 27) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 25) (15, 11) (15, 28) (20, 23) (20, 15) (20, 21) (4, 18) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 6) (11, 17) (11, 15) (11, 21) (28, 15) (28, 1) (28, 22) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 24) (7, 14) (25, 23) (25, 15) (25, 19) (10, 14) (10, 5) (21, 20) (21, 11) (21, 9) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 9) (5, 10) (26, 4) (26, 3) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 1) (0, 9) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 24) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 2) (24, 29) (6, 18) (6, 12) (27, 14) (27, 17) (27, 23) (27, 18) (27, 29) (29, 24) (29, 27) (1, 28) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (9, 15) (9, 21) (9, 19) (9, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (3, 26) (3, 2) (22, 28) (22, 0) 

Response:

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 13, 17)>
<1, (0, 13, 28)>
<2, (1, 3, 24)>
<4, (6, 18, 26)>
<6, (4, 12, 18)>
<8, (19, 23, 25)>
<9, (0, 15, 21)>
<10, (5, 14, 17)>
<11, (15, 17, 21)>
<15, (9, 11, 25)>
<17, (0, 14, 27)>
<18, (4, 6, 27)>
