Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 5) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (7, 14) (7, 12) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (0, 16) (0, 13) (1, 12) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 15) (5, 17) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 11) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (3, 13) (3, 19) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 16) (8, 10) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 10) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, we can identify which nodes are connected to the central node, i.e., nodes with degree 3.
From the given edges, nodes 14, 17, and 7 are connected to the central node 14, nodes 12, 1, and 7 are connected to the central node 12, and nodes 15, 11, and 5 are connected to the central node 15.

Next, we need to find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<14, (17, 11, 7)>
<12, (17, 1, 7)>
<15, (5, 11, 1)>

Counting the number of 3-stars, we find that there are [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
