Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 7
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 3
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 4
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 1
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 1
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 2
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 1
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 2

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Node 6: <6, (9, 5, 7)>
2. Node 9: <9, (6, 3, 7)>
3. Node 4: <4, (6, 8, 3)>
4. Node 5: <5, (6, 8, 3)>
5. Node 3: <3, (6, 9, 4)>
6. Node 7: <7, (6, 9, 1)>
7. Node 2: <2, (4, 5, 1)>
8. Node 1: <1, (9, 7, 2)>
9. Node 0: <0, (9, 4, 1)>
10. Node 8: <8, (4, 5, 2)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the final answer is [10].
