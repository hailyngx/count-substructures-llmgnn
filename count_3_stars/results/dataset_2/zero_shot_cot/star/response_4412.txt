Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (7, 11, 14)>
<2, (8, 10, 2)>
<3, (0, 10, 3)>
<4, (8, 9, 13)>
<5, (10, 12, 5)>
<6, (0, 9, 12)>
<7, (1, 11, 14)>
<8, (2, 4, 13)>
<9, (4, 6, 12)>
<10, (9, 10, 13)>
<11, (1, 6, 7)>
<12, (0, 5, 13)>
<13, (12, 4, 7)>
<14, (1, 5, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph gives us the final answer: [14].
