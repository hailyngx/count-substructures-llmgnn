Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as those are potential centers of 3-stars in the graph. 
- Node 5, degree 4
- Node 9, degree 5
- Node 4, degree 5
- Node 7, degree 5
- Node 6, degree 4
- Node 2, degree 3
- Node 8, degree 4
- Node 0, degree 6
- Node 1, degree 2
- Node 3, degree 4

Now let's go through the list of edges and count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

1. For node 5:
   - (5, 9, 8) - One 3-star

2. For node 9:
   - (9, 5, 8) - One 3-star

3. For node 4:
   - (4, 5, 7) - One 3-star

4. For node 7:
   - (7, 5, 8) - One 3-star

So, there are <5, (9, 8, 5)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 4)>, <7, (5, 8, 7)>.

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
