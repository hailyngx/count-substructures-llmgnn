Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 4) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (1, 19) (1, 18) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (15, 16) (15, 10) (16, 6) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 13) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 11) (14, 18) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 3) (3, 8) (3, 19) (3, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 12) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are a few steps to follow:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
   
2. Determine if those nodes form a 3-star structure by making sure they are connected to each other.

3. Count the number of unique 3-star structures.

Let's work step by step:

1. Based on the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 13, 15, 17, 19.

2. Now, let's check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star structure:
- Node 0: (0, 8, 16, 13) cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 1: (1, 19, 18, 7) can form a 3-star: <1, (19, 18, 7)>.
- Node 2: (2, 8, 19) cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 3: (3, 8, 19, 7) cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7: (7, 8, 1, 10, 3) cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 13: (13, 17, 0) cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 15: (15, 16, 10) cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 17: (17, 6, 13) cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 19: (19, 2, 1, 3) cannot form a 3-star.

3. The only 3-star structure found is <1, (19, 18, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 

<1, (19, 18, 7)>
