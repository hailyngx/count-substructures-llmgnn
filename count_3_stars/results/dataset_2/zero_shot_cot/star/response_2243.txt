Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since a 3-star has the center connected to three other nodes, we need to find nodes that have exactly three edges.

From the given edges, we can identify the nodes with exactly three edges: 0, 13, 14.

To find the 3-stars, we will look at each central node and find the corresponding leaves. 

For node 0:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 5, 1, and 6. These nodes form a 3-star. 
<0, (5, 1, 6)>

For node 13:
- Node 13 has edges with nodes 5, which is already part of a 3-star.

For node 14:
- Node 14 has edges with nodes 8, 9, and 8. These nodes form a 3-star.
<14, (8, 9, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
