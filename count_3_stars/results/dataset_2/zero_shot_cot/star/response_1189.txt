Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After analyzing the provided edges, we can identify the 3-star structures in the graph. Let's list them as follows: 

<5, (9, 6, 11)>
<9, (5, 10, 4)>
<4, (9, 0, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<10, (9, 11, 3)>
<11, (5, 10, 13)>
<3, (10, 13, 12)>
<2, (7, 10, 8)>
<8, (10, 2, 0)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<14, (5, 13, 12)>
<12, (9, 4, 3)>
<13, (7, 11, 14)>

As we have listed all the unique 3-stars found in the graph, we calculate the total number by counting them: [13].
