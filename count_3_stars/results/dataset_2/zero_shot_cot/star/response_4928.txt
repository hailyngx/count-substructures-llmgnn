Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 9) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 15) (7, 8) (7, 18) (7, 16) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 19) (2, 6) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 1) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 11) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 15) (17, 0) (17, 5) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <0, (16, 9, 17)>
2. <1, (8, 5, 14)>
3. <3, (18, 16, 14)>
4. <4, (11, 6, 1)>
5. <5, (8, 1, 11)>
6. <6, (1, 4, 2)>
7. <7, (8, 18, 16)>
8. <9, (0, 3, 15)>
9. <10, (13, 18, 19)>
10. <12, (14, 15, 19)>

It looks like there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, hence the final answer is [10].
