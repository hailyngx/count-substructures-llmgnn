Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 5) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 14) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 5) (29, 16) (29, 3) (7, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (24, 26) (24, 18) (26, 24) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 21) (27, 4) (27, 22) (27, 6) (1, 28) (1, 13) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) (8, 9) (8, 22) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 14) (21, 4) (21, 9) (5, 17) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 25) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 28) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 8) (22, 0) (2, 12) (2, 16) (6, 4) (6, 27) (6, 3) (14, 15) (14, 9) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 2) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 11) (18, 13) (23, 25) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 25) (0, 11) (0, 22) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 28) (13, 1) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-star graphs.

Nodes with 3 connections: 
- Node 28 (connected to 17, 1, 9, 19, 25)
- Node 11 (connected to 7, 4, 3, 0, 18)
- Node 9 (connected to 3, 8, 21, 28, 14)
- Node 5 (connected to 17, 20, 12, 19, 25)

Now, let's form 3-stars using these identified center nodes and their connected nodes:

<28, (17, 1, 9, 19, 25)>
<11, (7, 4, 3, 0, 18)>
<9, (3, 8, 21, 28, 14)>
<5, (17, 20, 12, 19, 25)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [4].
