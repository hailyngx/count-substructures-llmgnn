Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 18) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 2) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 4) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 18) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 0) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 8) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (18, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that have degree 3, those are nodes 0, 1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, and 19.

Then, for each of these nodes, we can check if they form a 3-star by ensuring they are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Now let's identify the 3-stars by checking each of these nodes one by one:
- Node 0: (0, 1, 8), (0, 12, 17), (0, 8, 14)
- Node 1: (1, 0, 6), (1, 8, 18), (1, 13, 15)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 17), (6, 8, 7), (6, 13, 19)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 17), (8, 1, 6), (8, 7, 15)
- Node 10: (10, 4, 15), (10, 12, 9), (10, 15, 18)
- Node 12: (12, 0, 9), (12, 4, 10), (12, 10, 15)
- Node 13: (13, 1, 15), (13, 6, 19), (13, 15, 18)
- Node 15: (15, 10, 18), (15, 13, 1), (15, 18, 19)
- Node 19: (19, 5, 17), (19, 6, 13), (19, 15, 18)

There are 18 3-stars found in total. So, the final answer is [18].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 8>
<0, 12, 17>
<0, 8, 14>
<1, 0, 6>
<1, 8, 18>
<1, 13, 15>
<6, 1, 17>
<6, 8, 7>
<6, 13, 19>
<8, 0, 17>
<8, 1, 6>
<8, 7, 15>
<10, 4, 15>
<10, 12, 9>
<10, 15, 18>
<12, 0, 9>
<12, 4, 10>
<12, 10, 15>
