Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars. 

First, we can identify the nodes with their degrees:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 4
Node 2: degree 3
Node 3: degree 4
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 4
Node 7: degree 2
Node 8: degree 3
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 6
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 6
Node 13: degree 4
Node 14: degree 4

From the degrees, we can see that nodes 10 and 12 are the only nodes that have degree greater than 3, making them potential centers for 3-stars.

Let's start with node 10 as the center:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 3, 6.
<10, (2, 5, 3)> and <10, (2, 5, 6)> are 3-stars centered at node 10.

Next, let's consider node 12 as the center:
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 0, 13, 14.
<12, (2, 4, 0)> and <12, (2, 4, 13)> are 3-stars centered at node 12.

Therefore, by counting the unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4] which is shown as <10, (2, 5, 3)>, <10, (2, 5, 6)>, <12, (2, 4, 0)>, <12, (2, 4, 13)>.
