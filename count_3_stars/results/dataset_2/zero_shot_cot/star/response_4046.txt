Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Since a 3-star has 4 nodes, we need to look for sets of 4 nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes but the other three nodes are not connected to each other.
Let's find the 3-stars and count how many there are:
<6, (9, 10, 11)>
<9, (6, 14, 1)>
<4, (7, 0, 11)>
<7, (4, 0, 8)>
<10, (6, 3, 12)>
<11, (6, 4, 13)>
<2, (1, 8, 0)>
<8, (7, 11, 5)>
<12, (10, 14, 13)>
<5, (7, 3, 8)>
<14, (9, 3, 12)>
<13, (10, 11, 0)>
(There are 12 unique 3-stars in this graph.)
