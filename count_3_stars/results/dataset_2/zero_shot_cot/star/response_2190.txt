Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 28) (9, 12) (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 28) (27, 2) (8, 4) (8, 25) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 21) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 22) (0, 12) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 29) (14, 25) (22, 0) (22, 28) (22, 3) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 17) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 18) (24, 29) (17, 26) (17, 20) (20, 17) (20, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 16) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 3) (19, 13) (16, 1) (21, 4) (21, 13) (21, 2) (11, 5) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 12) (3, 22) (3, 19) (3, 29) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 10) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 21) (13, 7) (28, 5) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 19) (7, 23) (7, 13) (7, 2) (29, 0) (29, 14) (29, 26) (29, 24) (29, 3) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (10, 23) (10, 25) (18, 24) (18, 11) (2, 27) (2, 21) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, we count how many 3-stars exist in the graph:
- We know that every 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.
- Since there are 30 nodes in total, we need to find the number of 3-stars in this graph.

To count the 3-stars, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We find that the following nodes satisfy this criteria:
- Node 1
- Node 4
- Node 15
- Node 22
- Node 24
- Node 29

Now, let's find the corresponding 3-stars for each of these central nodes:

<1, (4, 14, 25)>
<4, (1, 8, 13)>
<15, (1, 14, 27)>
<22, (0, 3, 28)>
<24, (11, 18, 26)>
<29, (0, 3, 26)>

Hence, we have a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
