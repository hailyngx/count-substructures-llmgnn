Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given that a 3-star graph has a central node connected to three other nodes, we can simply count the nodes with three neighbors.

Let's find the nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 6, and 8.
- Node 10 has neighbors 7, 11, and 0.
- Node 8 has neighbors 5, 4, and 7.
- Node 14 has neighbors 6, 0, and 2.
- Node 13 has neighbors 0, 12, and 2.
- Node 2 has neighbors 9, 10, and 6.
- Node 12 has neighbors 11, 13, and 2.
- Node 1 has neighbors 11, 8, and 14.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<10, (7, 11, 0)>
<8, (5, 4, 7)>
<14, (6, 0, 2)>
<13, (0, 12, 2)>
<2, (9, 10, 6)>
<12, (11, 13, 2)>
<1, (11, 8, 14)>

There are [8] unique 3-stars in the graph.
