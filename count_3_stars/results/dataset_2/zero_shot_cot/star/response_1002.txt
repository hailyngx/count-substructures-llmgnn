Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 2) (1, 11) (1, 27) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 2) (14, 15) (17, 25) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 15) (22, 24) (22, 29) (22, 25) (22, 8) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 12) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 4) (8, 22) (8, 19) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 6) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 29) (29, 22) (29, 4) (29, 23) (29, 11) (13, 26) (13, 19) (13, 23) (6, 21) (6, 19) (6, 20) (10, 21) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 11) (16, 10) (16, 23) (3, 12) (28, 8) (28, 7) (25, 17) (25, 22) (25, 0) (7, 28) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 15) (24, 22) (24, 5) (24, 20) (20, 6) (20, 24) (2, 26) (2, 21) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 24) (23, 29) (23, 13) (23, 16) (23, 12) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 9 has 3 edges: (9, 26), (9, 18), (9, 12). So, <9, (26, 18, 12)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 26 also has 3 edges: (26, 9), (26, 13), (26, 2). So, <26, (9, 13, 2)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 12 has 4 edges, which means it is not the center of a 3-star.
4. None of the other nodes have exactly 3 edges, so there are only 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
