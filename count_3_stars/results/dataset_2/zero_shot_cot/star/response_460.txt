Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (2, 23) (2, 27) (29, 17) (29, 7) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 23) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 0) (25, 28) (25, 24) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 4) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 26) (7, 29) (12, 25) (12, 14) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 8) (26, 17) (26, 18) (26, 11) (26, 0) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 18) (8, 5) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (11, 26) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 24) (27, 2) (27, 23) (22, 16) (0, 25) (0, 17) (0, 26) (0, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 23) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 9) (16, 4) (23, 2) (23, 20) (23, 27) (23, 13) (4, 28) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (24, 25) (24, 14) 

Response:
First, we will identify the nodes that are directly connected to a central node forming a 3-star graph.

Given the edges:
- 3 is connected to 15, 20, and 8
- 15 is connected to 3, 19, 8, and 16
- 20 is connected to 3, 25, 23, and 28
- 25 is connected to 20, 12, 0, 28, and 24
- 28 is connected to 20, 25, and 4
- 17 is connected to 29, 0, 19, and 26
- 7 is connected to 29
- 12 is connected to 25 and 14
- 18 is connected to 26, 5, 10, and 8
- 26 is connected to 17, 18, 11, and 0
- 8 is connected to 3, 15, 18, and 5
- 19 is connected to 15, 17, and 11
- 5 is connected to 18, 8, and 11
- 1 is connected to 6, 11, and 13
- 6 is connected to 1 and 10
- 11 is connected to 26, 19, 5, and 1
- 14 is connected to 12 and 24
- 2 is connected to 23 and 27
- 29 is connected to 17 and 7
- 23 is connected to 2, 20, 27, and 13
- 4 is connected to 28, 0, 10, and 16
- 24 is connected to 25 and 14
- 9 is connected to 10 and 16
- 10 is connected to 18, 6, 9, 4, and 13
- 13 is connected to 1, 10, 23

Now, we list all the unique 3-stars found:
<3, (15, 20, 8)>
<15, (3, 19, 8)>
<20, (3, 25, 23)>
<25, (20, 12, 0)>
<28, (20, 25, 4)>
<17, (29, 0, 19)>
<18, (26, 5, 10)>
<26, (17, 18, 11)>
<8, (3, 18, 5)>
<19, (15, 17, 11)>
<5, (18, 8, 11)>
<1, (6, 11, 13)>
<6, (1, 10, _)>
<11, (26, 19, 5)>
<14, (12, 24, _)>
<2, (23, 27, _)>
<29, (17, 7, _)>
<23, (2, 20, 27)>
<4, (28, 0, 10)>
<24, (25, 14, _)>
<9, (10, 16,_ )>
<10, (18, 6, 9)>
<13, (1, 10, 23)>
<16, (15, 22, 9)> 

Counting the number of unique 3-star configurations, we get:
