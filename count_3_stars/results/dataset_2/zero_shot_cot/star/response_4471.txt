Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges:

1. Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 0)
2. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 10)
3. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 2)
4. Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 0), (14, 1)
5. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 14)
6. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 7), (2, 1)
7. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 7)
8. Node 12: (12, 6), (12, 4), (12, 10)
9. Node 7: (7, 11), (7, 2), (7, 8)
10. Node 1: (1, 12), (1, 0), (1, 14)
11. Node 10: (10, 6), (10, 12), (10, 14)
12. Node 4: (4, 12), (4, 14), (4, 11)
13. Node 11: (11, 7), (11, 3), (11, 13)
14. Node 3: (3, 11), (3, 13)
15. Node 13: (13, 0), (13, 3), (13, 11)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:

<5, (6, 8, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 10)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
<14, (9, 0, 1)>
<0, (5, 6, 14)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<12, (6, 4, 10)>
<7, (11, 2, 8)>
<1, (12, 0, 14)>
<10, (6, 12, 14)>
<4, (12, 14, 11)>
<11, (7, 3, 13)>

There are [13] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
