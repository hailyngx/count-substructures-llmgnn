Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 9) (14, 0) (1, 17) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 15) (17, 18) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 6) (10, 5) (10, 18) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 13) (3, 13) (8, 11) (8, 15) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 15) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 2) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

1. From node 5: (5, 9, 12), (5, 13, 3), (5, 4, 2), (5, 15, 8), (5, 10, 18)
2. From node 9: (9, 5, 4), (9, 14, 0), (9, 12, 16)
3. From node 4: (4, 5, 9), (4, 7, 17), (4, 2, 13)
4. From node 7: (7, 4, 2), (7, 17, 1)
5. From node 17: (17, 7, 4), (17, 15, 8), (17, 18, 10)
6. From node 13: (13, 5, 9), (13, 12, 16), (13, 2, 4), (13, 3, 5)
7. From node 18: (18, 17, 7), (18, 19, 6), (18, 10, 5), (18, 6, 16)
8. From node 19: (19, 11, 8), (19, 0, 14), (19, 18, 17), (19, 6, 16)
9. From node 10: (10, 5, 9), (10, 18, 17)
10. From node 12: (12, 16, 6), (12, 9, 5), (12, 13, 2)

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of 20 3-stars.

So the final answer is [20].
