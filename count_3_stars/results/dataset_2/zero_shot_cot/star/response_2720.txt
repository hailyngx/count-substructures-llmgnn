Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 12) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 12) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 10)>
<3, (2, 5, 13)>
<4, (2, 8, 14)>
<5, (1, 3, 13)>
<6, (0, 12, 13)>
<7, (2, 9, 11)>
<8, (4, 9, 13)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<10, (2, 5, 14)>
<11, (7, 10, 14)>
<12, (1, 6, 14)>
<13, (3, 5, 4)>
<14, (4, 6, 10)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found a total of 13 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
