Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would form a 3-star graph.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5: connected to nodes 9, 6, and 0
- Node 9: connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2
- Node 7: connected to nodes 5, 4, and 0
- Node 1: connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7
- Node 6: connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1 
- Node 8: connected to nodes 4, 1, and 2
- Node 0: connected to nodes 5, 7, and 3

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- We have 7 nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which means there are 7 possible 3-stars in the graph.
- Each 3-star can be uniquely represented, so we list them out: 
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 2)>
<7, (5, 4, 0)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (4, 1, 2)>
<0, (5, 7, 3)>
