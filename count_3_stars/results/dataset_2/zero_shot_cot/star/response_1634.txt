Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 16) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 14) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 8) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 1) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we should look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's start by identifying the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 18, 1)>
<6, (7, 2, 19)>
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 19)>
<2, (6, 18, 15)>
<18, (5, 2, 16)>
<13, (6, 11, 15)>
<0, (5, 3, 16)>
<16, (18, 0, 15)>
<10, (0, 4, )>
<7, (6, 3, 19)>
<19, (6, 1, 7)>
<14, (13, 8, 12)>

Now let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [13].
