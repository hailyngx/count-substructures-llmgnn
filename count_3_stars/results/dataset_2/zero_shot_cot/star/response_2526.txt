Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 4) (6, 8) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 1, 2)>
<3, (1, 13, 12)>
<4, (9, 13, 2)>
<5, (13, 3, 11)>
<6, (8, 11, 7)>
<7, (9, 0, 10)>
<8, (13, 14, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 14)>
<10, (0, 12, 7)>
<11, (6, 4, 5)>
<12, (2, 3, 10)>
<13, (8, 5, 4)>
<14, (9, 10, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [13].
