Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 19) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 16) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (13, 17) (13, 0) (13, 15) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (3, 10) (3, 4) (19, 9) (19, 11) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all 3-stars in the graph. 
To do this, we look for nodes that are connected in a star-like pattern with one central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars we can find in this graph:
<6, (1, 2, 12)>
<9, (6, 15, 16)>
<10, (1, 3, 11)>
<11, (5, 8, 19)>
<2, (6, 12, 17)>
<17, (13, 14, 15)>
<12, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 10, 11)>
<5, (7, 8, 11)>
<0, (1, 7, 13)>
<13, (0, 15, 17)>
<4, (3, 12, 16)>

Since each 3-star is listed only once in the above list, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
