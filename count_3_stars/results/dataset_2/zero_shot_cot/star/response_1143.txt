Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's enumerate the 3-stars present in this graph:

1. <0, (4, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 5)>
3. <2, (4, 5, 9)>
4. <3, (2, 5, 7)>
5. <4, (0, 2, 9)>
6. <5, (0, 1, 3)>
7. <6, (2, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (3, 4, 5)>
9. <8, (0, 1, 3)>
10. <9, (2, 4, 3)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph and output the answer within brackets: [10].
