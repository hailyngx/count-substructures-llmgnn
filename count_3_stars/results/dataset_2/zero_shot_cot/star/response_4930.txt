Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 11) (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 19) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 15) (18, 19) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 12) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (16, 9) (16, 0) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 11) (1, 13) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges coming out of them. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

The nodes with three edges are:
- Node 3
- Node 15
- Node 9
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 13
- Node 7
- Node 12
- Node 2
- Node 4
- Node 18
- Node 10
- Node 17
- Node 0
- Node 16
- Node 19
- Node 11
- Node 14

Now let's count the number of 3-stars by examining each center node one by one.

For Node 3:
- <3, (15, 6, 9)>
- <3, (15, 4, 2)>
Total: 2

For Node 15:
- <15, (3, 10, 18)>
- <15, (3, 10, 11)>
Total: 2

For Node 9:
- <9, (3, 5, 16)>
Total: 1

For Node 6:
- <6, (3, 17, 0)>
Total: 1

For Node 8:
- <8, (13, 2, 14)>
Total: 1

For Node 13:
- <13, (8, 7, 17)>
- <13, (8, 1, 17)>
Total: 2

For Node 7:
- <7, (13, 12, 10)>
Total: 1

For Node 12:
- <12, (7, 10, 14)>
- <12, (7, 10, 19)>
Total: 2

For Node 2:
- <2, (3, 8, 17)>
Total: 1

For Node 4:
- <4, (3, 5, 17)>
Total: 1

For Node 18:
- <18, (15, 19, 11)>
Total: 1

For Node 10:
- <10, (15, 7, 12)>
Total: 1

For Node 17:
- <17, (6, 13, 2)>
- <17, (6, 4, 13)>
Total: 2

For Node 0:
- <0, (6, 16, 11)>
Total: 1

For Node 16:
- <16, (9, 0, 11)>
Total: 1

For Node 19:
- <19, (18, 12, 11)>
Total: 1

For Node 11:
- <11, (15, 0, 19)>
Total: 1

For Node 14:
- <14, (8, 12, 2)>
Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
