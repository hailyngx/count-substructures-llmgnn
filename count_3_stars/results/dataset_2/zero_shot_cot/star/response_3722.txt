Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 27) (26, 16) (15, 27) (15, 4) (27, 9) (27, 15) (27, 19) (2, 22) (2, 1) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 14) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 25) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 21) (23, 14) (17, 29) (17, 10) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 29) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 12) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 24) (6, 4) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (24, 5) (24, 25) (24, 19) (7, 16) (7, 28) (16, 26) (16, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 18) (19, 27) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 24) (19, 1) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 3) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 7) (28, 1) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 18) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 28) (21, 22) (21, 18) (18, 6) (18, 12) (18, 3) (18, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 19, and 28.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 12.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 28.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 17.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 10, and 11.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 29.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 4, 19, and 27.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 26, and 28.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 21.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 1, 22, and 24.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 2, 19, and 21.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 5, 19, and 25.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 9, 15, and 19.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 7.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 17.

2. Counting the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 19, 28)>
- <3, (13, 14, 18)>
- <4, (5, 6, 12)>
- <8, (4, 12, 28)>
- <10, (11, 13, 17)>
- <11, (10, 13, 14)>
- <12, (4, 8, 18)>
- <13, (3, 10, 11)>
- <14, (3, 11, 29)>
- <15, (4, 19, 27)>
- <16, (7, 26, 28)>
- <18, (3, 6, 21)>
- <19, (1, 22, 24)>
- <22, (2, 19, 21)>
- <24, (5, 19, 25)>
- <27, (9, 15, 19)>
- <28, (1, 8, 7)>
- <29, (8, 14, 17)>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
