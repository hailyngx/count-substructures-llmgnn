Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 8) (9, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 21) (8, 18) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 2) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 23) (15, 4) (15, 1) (15, 25) (20, 2) (20, 19) (20, 5) (20, 16) (29, 0) (29, 5) (5, 17) (5, 20) (5, 29) (5, 19) (5, 25) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 20) (19, 5) (14, 1) (14, 26) (26, 14) (26, 11) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 22) (16, 20) (16, 7) (16, 2) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 24) (11, 26) (11, 12) (24, 3) (24, 2) (25, 6) (25, 15) (25, 5) (2, 28) (2, 20) (2, 16) (2, 24) (0, 4) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 21) (18, 8) (18, 23) (18, 27) (18, 13) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 18) (21, 8) (21, 0) (27, 18) (27, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 22) (22, 7) (22, 12) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 27) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-star structures in the graph based on the given edges. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <6, (9, 28, 25)>
2. <9, (6, 10, 25)>
3. <10, (12, 13, 19)>
4. <17, (23, 19, 5)>
5. <4, (8, 0, 15)>
6. <8, (6, 4, 21)>
7. <28, (6, 3, 0)>
8. <1, (15, 14, 23)>
9. <15, (4, 1, 25)>
10. <20, (2, 19, 5)>
11. <29, (0, 5, 29)>
12. <5, (17, 20, 25)>
13. <19, (10, 17, 20)>
14. <14, (1, 26, 23)>
15. <26, (14, 11, 26)>
16. <7, (16, 3, 22)>
17. <16, (20, 7, 2)>
18. <3, (28, 7, 24)>
19. <11, (26, 12, 11)>
20. <24, (3, 2, 24)>
21. <18, (8, 23, 27)>
22. <23, (17, 1, 18)>
23. <21, (8, 0, 21)>
24. <27, (18, 13, 27)>
25. <12, (10, 11, 22)>
26. <22, (7, 12, 22)>
27. <13, (10, 18, 27)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [27]
