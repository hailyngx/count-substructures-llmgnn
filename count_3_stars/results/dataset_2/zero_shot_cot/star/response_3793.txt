Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. 
From the given edge list, we can list the 3-stars as follows: 
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<4, (9, 8, 6)>
<8, (5, 4, 14)>
<6, (5, 4, 14)>
<7, (12, 14, 13)>
<12, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (9, 14, 3)>
<14, (8, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 11)>
<11, (2, 1, 13)>
<3, (9, 0, 2)>
<1, (5, 7, 14)>
<13, (6, 7, 12)>
<10, (4, 14)>
Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
