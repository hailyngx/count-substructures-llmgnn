Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 15) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 15) (3, 10) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can start by identifying the central node of each potential 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Central node 0: 
   - Connected to nodes 1, 7, 10
   
2. Central node 1:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 6, 9

3. Central node 2:
   - Connected to nodes 5, 11, 18

4. Central node 4:
   - Connected to nodes 5, 15, 19

5. Central node 5:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 4, 6

6. Central node 7:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 11, 13

7. Central node 8:
   - Connected to nodes 10, 11, 17

8. Central node 10:
   - Connected to nodes 0, 3, 5

9. Central node 11:
   - Connected to nodes 2, 7, 15

10. Central node 13:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 7, 12

11. Central node 14:
    - Connected to nodes 7, 9, 19

12. Central node 15:
    - Connected to nodes 4, 11, 16

13. Central node 16:
    - Connected to nodes 15, 17

14. Central node 17:
    - Connected to nodes 8, 16

15. Central node 18:
    - Connected to nodes 2, 15

16. Central node 19:
    - Connected to nodes 4, 14

From the identified 3-stars, we see that the following unique 3-stars exist:
<0, 1, 7>, <2, 4, 5>, <5, 6, 2>, <7, 0, 13>, <8, 10, 17>, <10, 0, 5>, <11, 2, 7>, <13, 0, 7>, <14, 7, 9>, <15, 4, 11>, <16, 15, 17>, <18, 2, 15>, <19, 4, 14>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
