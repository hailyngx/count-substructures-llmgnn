Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 0) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. 
Looking at the edges, we can see that nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, 13, 10, 11, 12, and 6 have connections to at least three other nodes. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 13, 8)>
<9, (5, 2, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, unspecified)>
<7, (9, 4, 11)>
<8, (5, 13, 2)>
<13, (5, 9, 3)>
<10, (13, 0, 1)>
<11, (7, 1, 6)>
<12, (8, 14, unspecified)>
<6, (5, 11, 1)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
