Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The nodes with three edges are:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1, 7, and 6)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7)

There are 7 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
