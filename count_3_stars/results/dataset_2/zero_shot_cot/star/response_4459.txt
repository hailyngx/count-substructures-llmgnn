Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 22) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 15) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 0) (23, 3) (23, 0) (23, 20) (2, 8) (2, 10) (19, 29) (19, 17) (19, 28) (26, 13) (26, 10) (26, 27) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 24) (4, 20) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 13) (13, 26) (13, 18) (13, 25) (13, 3) (13, 6) (22, 16) (22, 4) (22, 14) (6, 13) (6, 24) (6, 20) (24, 4) (24, 6) (24, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 12) (3, 23) (3, 13) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (14, 22) (29, 8) (29, 19) (29, 5) (25, 13) (25, 12) (27, 26) (27, 18) (27, 1) (0, 8) (0, 23) (0, 17) (1, 27) (1, 9) (1, 12) (9, 7) (9, 24) (9, 1) (28, 19) (28, 5) (28, 15) (12, 11) (12, 21) (12, 10) (12, 25) (12, 1) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 28) (15, 21) (15, 28) (20, 23) (20, 4) (20, 18) (20, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node and three leaves connected to it.

1. (1, 9, 12, 25) [1]
2. (2, 8, 10, 26) [1]
3. (3, 13, 23, 25) [1]
4. (4, 18, 20, 24) [1]
5. (5, 17, 28, 29) [1]
6. (6, 13, 20, 24) [1]
7. (7, 10, 21, 29) [1]
8. (9, 1, 7, 24) [1]
9. (10, 2, 7, 26) [1]
10. (12, 1, 21, 25) [1]
11. (13, 3, 6, 25) [1]
12. (15, 21, 28, 29) [1]
13. (16, 11, 22, 4) [1]
14. (18, 4, 13, 20) [1]
15. (19, 17, 28, 29) [1]
16. (20, 18, 23, 6) [1]
17. (21, 7, 12, 15) [1]
18. (22, 4, 14, 16) [1]
19. (24, 4, 6, 9) [1]
20. (25, 12, 13, 3) [1]
21. (26, 10, 13, 27) [1]
22. (27, 1, 18, 26) [1]
23. (28, 15, 17, 5) [1]
24. (29, 5, 8, 21) [1]

Therefore, there are a total of [24] 3-stars in the given graph.
