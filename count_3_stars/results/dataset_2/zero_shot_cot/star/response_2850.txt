Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 11) (18, 14) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 5) (16, 6) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 16) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 16) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 4) 

Response:
