Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Look for nodes with exactly three incident edges:
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 0)
- Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 1), (2, 3)
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 2), (3, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 1)
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 1)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2)
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 7), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 1)
- Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 0)

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 4, 6)>
- <1, (5, 2, 6)>
- <1, (5, 6, 1)>
- <1, (5, 1, 0)>
- <2, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (2, 5, 1)>
- <2, (2, 5, 9)>
- <2, (2, 6, 1)>
- <2, (2, 6, 3)>
- <2, (2, 1, 0)>
- <3, (3, 9, 6)>
- <4, (4, 9, 7)>
- <7, (7, 4, 6)>
- <8, (8, 7, 2)>
- <8, (8, 7, 3)>
- <8, (8, 7, 1)>
- <9, (9, 4, 2)>
- <9, (9, 4, 3)>
- <9, (9, 4, 0)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [18]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
