Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 10) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 12) (9, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 19) (17, 11) (17, 0) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 10) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 19) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 14) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 3) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 10) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 18) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 19) (2, 16) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three leaves, we look for nodes that have exactly 3 adjacent edges.

After identifying the 3-stars, we list them below and count the total number. 

<1, (2, 5, 15)>
<2, (1, 4, 16)>
<3, (4, 13, 19)>
<4, (2, 3, 12)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 5, 12)>
<7, (15, 16, 19)>
<8, (4, 9, 15)>
<10, (0, 1, 12)>
<12, (4, 6, 10)>
<13, (3, 12, 19)>
<15, (1, 7, 8)>
<16, (2, 7, 17)>
<18, (6, 14, 19)>
<19, (3, 7, 18)>
<0, (6, 10, 17)>
<11, (17, 0, 16)>
<14, (18, 16, 0)>
<17, (11, 0, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
