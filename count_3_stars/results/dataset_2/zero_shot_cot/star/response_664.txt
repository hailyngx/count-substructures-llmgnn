Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 2) (9, 26) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 18) (15, 2) (15, 17) (27, 22) (27, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 24) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 17) (23, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 6) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 22) (20, 5) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 29) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 22) (29, 21) (24, 10) (24, 4) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (7, 17) (7, 13) (25, 0) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (22, 27) (22, 20) (22, 29) (22, 3) (3, 18) (3, 22) (3, 12) (28, 12) (28, 14) (28, 5) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 3) (12, 28) (12, 4) (12, 13) (21, 16) (21, 29) (19, 18) (19, 4) (1, 29) (1, 18) (5, 20) (5, 28) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 6) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 29) (6, 14) (13, 20) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
Let's first find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (9, 10, 20)>
<1, (18, 19, 29)>
<2, (15, 16, 10)>
<3, (12, 18, 22)>
<4, (12, 19, 24)>
<5, (20, 22, 28)>
<6, (14, 27, 29)>
<7, (13, 17, 7)>
<8, (14, 17, 8)>
<9, (0, 26, 6)>
<10, (0, 16, 24)>
<11, (16, 10, 20)>
<12, (3, 4, 7)>
<13, (7, 12, 13)>
<14, (6, 8, 14)>
<15, (2, 17, 15)>
<16, (2, 11, 21)>
<17, (1, 7, 17)>
<18, (1, 3, 18)>
<19, (4, 18, 19)>
<20, (0, 5, 13)>
<21, (16, 21, 29)>
<22, (3, 5, 22)>
<23, (8, 23, 14)>
<24, (4, 10, 24)>
<25, (0, 25, 20)>
<26, (0, 18, 26)>
<27, (6, 22, 27)>
<28, (5, 14, 28)>
<29, (1, 6, 29)>

There are 29 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore the final answer is [29].
