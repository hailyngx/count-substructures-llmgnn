Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. In a 3-star graph, the central node will have exactly three other nodes connected to it.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Central node 5: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 3) -> <5, (9, 8, 3)>
2. Central node 9: (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 1) -> <9, (6, 4, 1)>
3. Central node 6: (6, 9), (6, 2), (6, 8) -> <6, (9, 2, 8)>
4. Central node 1: (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7) -> <1, (9, 8, 7)>
5. Central node 3: (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 2) -> <3, (5, 7, 2)>
6. Central node 4: (4, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8) -> <4, (9, 7, 8)>
7. Central node 7: (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 3) -> <7, (5, 1, 3)>
8. Central node 8: (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 1) -> <8, (5, 6, 1)>
9. Central node 2: (2, 6), (2, 3), (2, 8) -> <2, (6, 3, 8)>
10. Central node 0: (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 7) -> <0, (9, 6, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
