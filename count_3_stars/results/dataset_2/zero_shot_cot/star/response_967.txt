Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 15) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 19) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 5) (10, 16) (10, 17) (10, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 6) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 6) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 19) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 9) (13, 14) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (7, 5, 9)>
<4, (7, 15, 5)>
<5, (1, 17, 8)>
<6, (17, 19, 2)>
<8, (14, 10, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 12)>
<10, (16, 17, 8)>
<12, (11, 17, 9)>
<13, (14, 18, 18)>
<15, (16, 4, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
