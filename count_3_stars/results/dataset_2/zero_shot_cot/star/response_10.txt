Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 11) (18, 16) (5, 4) (5, 16) (13, 7) (3, 11) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 16) (12, 2) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 19) (1, 11) (1, 8) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 17) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 16) (14, 8) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 17) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 8) (0, 8) (17, 9) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 7) (16, 18) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible star configurations where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Identify all nodes with degree 3, as these nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star. Nodes with degree 3 are: 2, 4, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 19.

2. For each node found in step 1, check if it is indeed the center of a 3-star configuration by examining its neighbors.

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Let's go through each potential center node and identify the unique 3-star configurations. 

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [7]

Unique 3-star configurations:
<2, (6, 10, 12)>
<4, (5, 10, 12)>
<11, (1, 15, 3)>
<12, (2, 4, 19)>
<15, (6, 19, 16)>
<16, (4, 15, 18)>
<17, (9, 7, 19)>
