Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 7) (17, 16) (17, 6) (17, 18) (2, 10) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 13) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 17) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 1: (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 1, 11), (3, 1, 12)
- Node 4: (4, 1, 5)
- Node 5: (5, 4, 6), (5, 4, 13)
- Node 6: (6, 0, 5), (6, 0, 14), (6, 17, 6)
- Node 8: (8, 1, 9), (8, 1, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 8, 11), (9, 8, 15)
- Node 10: (10, 15, 18), (10, 15, 2)
- Node 11: (11, 3, 14)
- Node 12: (12, 3, 13), (12, 3, 14)
- Node 14: (14, 0, 6), (14, 0, 18), (14, 11, 6)
- Node 15: (15, 9, 10), (15, 9, 7)
- Node 16: (16, 11, 17)
- Node 17: (17, 16, 6), (17, 16, 18)
- Node 18: (18, 14, 10)
- Node 19: (19, 2, 3), (19, 2, 9)

There are a total of <1, 3, 4>, <1, 3, 8>, <3, 1, 11>, <3, 1, 12>, <4, 1, 5>, <5, 4, 6>, <5, 4, 13>, <6, 0, 5>, <6, 0, 14>, <6, 17, 6>, <8, 1, 9>, <8, 1, 7>, <9, 8, 11>, <9, 8, 15>, <10, 15, 18>, <10, 15, 2>, <11, 3, 14>, <12, 3, 13>, <12, 3, 14>, <14, 0, 6>, <14, 0, 18>, <14, 11, 6>, <15, 9, 10>, <15, 9, 7>, <16, 11, 17>, <17, 16, 6>, <17, 16, 18>, <18, 14, 10>, <19, 2, 3>, <19, 2, 9> unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [30].
