Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 3) (15, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 8) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 18) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 6) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 12) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (14, 1) (19, 10) (19, 1) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 11) 

Response:
There are <5, (9, 15, 10)>, <4, (8, 16, 15)>, <3, (6, 2, 18)>, <8, (13, 17, 12)>, <10, (17, 19, 2)>, <0, (16, 11, 12)>.
Therefore, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
