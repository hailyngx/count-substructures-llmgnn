Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (9, 7, 2)>
<2, (4, 6, 1)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (9, 0, 2)>
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<6, (7, 8, 2)>
<7, (1, 8, 6)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>
<9, (5, 4, 1)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, we can see that there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [10].
