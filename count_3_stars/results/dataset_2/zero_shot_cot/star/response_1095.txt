Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 5, as node 5 will be the center of the potential 3-star. The nodes connected to node 5 are 2, 4, and 7. 

Now, we need to check if these pairs form valid 3-stars. To form a 3-star, the remaining nodes connected to each of the potential leaves (2, 4, 7) should not be connected to each other. 

By checking these conditions, we find that out of the three potential 3-stars:

<5, (2, 4, 7)> is a valid 3-star, as none of the nodes 2, 4, and 7 are connected to each other.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <5, (2, 4, 7)>.
