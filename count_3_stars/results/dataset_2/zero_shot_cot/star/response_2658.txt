Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) 

Response:
We start by identifying the nodes that are directly connected to each node in the graph:

0: 6, 9, 7, 12
1: 13, 4, 12
2: 9, 10, 11, 8
3: 9, 14, 13
4: 1, 13, 5
5: 6, 10, 4, 7
6: 0, 5, 7, 12
7: 6, 12, 0, 5
8: 11, 2, 14
9: 6, 2, 14, 10, 3, 0
10: 9, 11, 2, 5
11: 10, 14, 8, 12, 2
12: 6, 1, 11, 7, 0
13: 1, 3, 4
14: 9, 3, 11, 8

Next, we look for 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <6, (9, 0, 7)>
2. <9, (6, 2, 10)>
3. <13, (1, 3, 4)>
4. <4, (1, 13, 5)>
5. <8, (11, 14, 2)>
6. <7, (6, 12, 0)>
7. <12, (6, 1, 11)>
8. <2, (9, 11, 10)>
9. <5, (6, 4, 10)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [9].
