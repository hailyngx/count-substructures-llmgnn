Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 17) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 14) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (4, 18) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 8) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 0) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 2) (0, 13) (0, 12) (8, 11) (8, 18) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 18) (14, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (17, 11) (17, 9) (7, 13) (7, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 11: (8, 15, 17)
2. Node 16: (3, 14, 11)
3. Node 15: (1, 3, 9)
4. Node 3: (1, 13, 15)
5. Node 9: (13, 15, 17)
6. Node 18: (4, 5, 14)
7. Node 13: (0, 3, 9)
8. Node 2: (12, 14, 19)
9. Node 6: (1, 10, 12)

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final count is [9].
