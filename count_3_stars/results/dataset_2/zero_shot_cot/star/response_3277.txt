Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 15) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 20) (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 26) (7, 22) (20, 21) (20, 25) (25, 9) (25, 20) (25, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 24) (10, 23) (10, 29) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 10) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 28) (23, 10) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 17) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 22) (4, 19) (4, 24) (0, 25) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 16) (24, 26) (24, 10) (24, 4) (24, 0) (18, 5) (18, 17) (22, 7) (22, 4) (22, 12) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 17) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 16) (28, 1) (28, 8) (28, 27) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 19) (29, 10) (29, 27) (6, 10) (6, 0) (27, 28) (27, 29) (27, 13) (13, 2) (13, 27) (13, 19) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 17) (5, 18) (17, 23) (17, 18) (17, 2) (17, 19) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (11, 21, 28)>
2. <2, (12, 13, 17)>
3. <4, (8, 19, 23)>
4. <9, (15, 25, 26)>
5. <10, (11, 23, 29)>
6. <14, (0, 16, 2)>
7. <17, (2, 18, 19)>
8. <22, (4, 7, 12)>
9. <24, (10, 4, 26)>
10. <27, (13, 28, 29)>

There are [10] unique 3-stars in the graph.
