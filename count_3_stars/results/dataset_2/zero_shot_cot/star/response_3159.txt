Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify which nodes are connected in 3-star configurations based on the given edges.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 10, 12)>
<1, (9, 10, 12)>
<2, (4, 10, 12)>
<3, (7, 10, 14)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (7, 9, 14)>
<6, (4, 6, 13)>
<7, (3, 5, 11)>
<8, (3, 8, 10)>
<9, (1, 4, 5)>
<10, (1, 8, 12)>
<11, (7, 9, 12)>
<12, (0, 1, 11)>
<13, (6, 10, 13)>
<14, (0, 7, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [14].
