Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (6, 13) (6, 14) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the potential 3-stars in the graph based on the given edges:
1. Node 10: (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 7)
2. Node 11: (11, 10), (11, 14), (11, 1), (11, 2)
3. Node 8: (8, 12), (8, 3), (8, 1)
4. Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 4), (13, 2), (13, 6)
5. Node 5: (5, 13), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 14)
6. Node 0: (0, 10), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 9)
7. Node 7: (7, 10), (7, 5), (7, 9), (7, 2), (7, 1)
8. Node 4: (4, 13), (4, 0)
9. Node 12: (12, 8), (12, 2), (12, 14), (12, 1)
10. Node 2: (2, 11), (2, 13), (2, 7), (2, 12), (2, 9)
11. Node 14: (14, 11), (14, 5), (14, 12), (14, 6), (14, 1)
12. Node 1: (1, 11), (1, 8), (1, 0), (1, 7), (1, 12), (1, 14)
13. Node 6: (6, 13), (6, 14)
14. Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 7), (9, 2), (9, 3)
15. Node 3: (3, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- There are 5 potential 3-stars centered around nodes 10, 11, 13, 5, and 2.
- Each of these 3-stars can be uniquely represented as follows:
  <10, (11, 0, 7)>, <11, (10, 14, 1)>, <13, (5, 4, 2)>, <5, (13, 0, 7)>, <2, (11, 13, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <10, (11, 0, 7)>, <11, (10, 14, 1)>, <13, (5, 4, 2)>, <5, (13, 0, 7)>, <2, (11, 13, 7)>.
