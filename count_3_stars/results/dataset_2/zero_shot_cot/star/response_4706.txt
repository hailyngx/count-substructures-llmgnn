Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 10) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (7, 5) (7, 16) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 16) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 10) (15, 13) (15, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (0, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 1) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 9) (3, 18) (19, 10) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 2) (2, 19) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can start by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<4, (5, 8, 10)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<10, (8, 14, 15)>
<9, (4, 11, 19)>
<0, (12, 13, 19)>
<16, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (8, 9, 12)>
<19, (0, 9, 10)>
<18, (3, 11, 14)>
<2, (19)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and the number of 3-stars is [9].
