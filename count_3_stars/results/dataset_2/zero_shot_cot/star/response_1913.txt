Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 11) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 8) (17, 2) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 29) (8, 17) (8, 25) (8, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 9) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 18) (12, 7) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 5) (26, 19) (26, 25) (15, 7) (15, 20) (15, 5) (15, 11) (20, 15) (28, 24) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 24) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 16) (29, 3) (29, 27) (29, 6) (6, 25) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 27) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 16) (22, 14) (22, 8) (11, 21) (11, 7) (11, 15) (11, 5) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 25) (16, 24) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 4) (27, 21) (27, 29) (27, 6) (0, 18) (0, 23) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 9) (23, 1) (23, 17) (23, 6) (23, 0) (9, 13) (9, 10) 

Response:
The given graph has a total of 30 nodes and 90 edges.

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star-like structure.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (21, 3, 23)>
<21, (1, 27, 19)>
<14, (17, 22, 2)>
<17, (14, 23, 8)>
<3, (1, 10, 29)>
<8, (17, 25, 22)>
<13, (16, 10, 9)>
<7, (12, 25, 11)>
<12, (7, 25, 4)>
<18, (7, 16, 0)>
<19, (21, 26, 5)>
<26, (19, 25, 6)>
<15, (7, 20, 11)>
<20, (15, 5, 24)>
<28, (24, 5, 16)>
<24, (28, 5, 16)>
<22, (14, 8, 2)>
<11, (21, 7, 15)>
<16, (13, 18, 25)>
<2, (14, 17, 4)>
<27, (21, 29, 6)>
<0, (18, 23, 16)>
<10, (3, 13, 9)>
<9, (13, 10, 9)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
