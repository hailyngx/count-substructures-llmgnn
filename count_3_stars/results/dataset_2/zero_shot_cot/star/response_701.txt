Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes and their connections. 

Node 0: Connected to nodes 7, 3, 4  
Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 2, 8, 4  
Node 2: Connected to nodes 5, 9, 1, 7, 4  
Node 3: Connected to nodes 9, 0, 8, 4  
Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 6, 0, 2, 1, 3  
Node 5: Connected to nodes 9, 6, 2  
Node 6: Connected to nodes 5, 1, 4  
Node 7: Connected to nodes 0, 2, 8  
Node 8: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 3, 1  
Node 9: Connected to nodes 5, 8, 4, 2, 3  

Now, count the number of 3-stars:  
(5, 9, 2)  
(6, 1, 4)  
(0, 7, 8)  
(3, 9, 8)  
(4, 6, 5)  

Therefore, there are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
