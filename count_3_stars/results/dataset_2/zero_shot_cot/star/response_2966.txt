Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 4: <5, (9, 8, 4)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 1: <9, (5, 6, 1)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 3, and no other node.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 1: <7, (9, 8, 1)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, 3: <1, (9, 7, 3)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, 1: <3, (5, 4, 1)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, 8: <6, (9, 1, 8)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 8, and no other node.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, 3: <8, (5, 7, 3)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, 6: <0, (5, 1, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
