Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 26) (9, 24) (9, 20) (9, 1) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 0) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 28) (23, 19) (12, 22) (12, 17) (12, 3) (27, 24) (27, 8) (15, 22) (15, 10) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 8) (0, 22) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 21) (19, 23) (19, 0) (26, 6) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 17) (21, 0) (21, 14) (21, 3) (28, 23) (28, 16) (28, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 29) (13, 5) (13, 7) (17, 12) (17, 20) (17, 0) (17, 26) (17, 7) (16, 28) (16, 1) (16, 25) (16, 2) (3, 12) (3, 21) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 26) (10, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 29) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 16) (1, 29) (1, 25) (29, 5) (29, 7) (29, 1) (8, 27) (8, 20) (24, 9) (24, 27) (25, 26) (25, 5) (25, 16) (25, 1) (25, 2) (2, 6) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found:

<6, (2, 26, 10)>
<9, (24, 20, 1)>
<22, (23, 15, 0)>
<23, (22, 28, 19)>
<12, (22, 17, 3)>
<15, (22, 10, 20)>
<20, (9, 17, 8)>
<0, (22, 21, 17)>
<19, (23, 0, 11)>
<26, (6, 10, 25)>
<21, (0, 14, 3)>
<28, (23, 16, 1)>
<17, (12, 20, 0)>
<16, (28, 25, 2)>
<3, (12, 21, 2)>
<11, (4, 7, 19)>
<10, (15, 14, 26)>
<7, (13, 17, 11)>
<1, (9, 28, 16)>
<29, (5, 7, 1)>
<8, (27, 20, 25)>
<24, (9, 27, 29)>
<25, (26, 5, 16)>
<2, (6, 16, 3)>

Thus, there are 24 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
The total count of 3-stars is [24].
