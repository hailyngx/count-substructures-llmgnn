Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 28) (8, 20) (13, 21) (13, 24) (13, 9) (13, 0) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 25) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 26) (27, 12) (27, 28) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 24) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 23) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 19) (1, 12) (1, 17) (1, 24) (1, 19) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 21) (21, 13) (21, 6) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 20) (20, 8) (20, 4) (29, 23) (16, 0) (16, 28) (28, 15) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 16) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 18) (23, 0) (23, 29) (23, 26) (23, 7) (26, 12) (26, 23) (26, 7) (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 26) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 14) (5, 17) (5, 25) (25, 10) (25, 5) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 1) (22, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming possible 3-stars. These nodes are: 

- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 9, and 28.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 18, and 3.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 3.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 18, 26, and 27.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 21, and 24.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 18.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 0, 26, and 29.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 23.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

From the identified nodes, we have the following 3-stars:
- <3, (10, 11, 15)>
- <15, (2, 9, 28)>
- <10, (11, 18, 3)>
- <11, (7, 10, 3)>
- <12, (18, 26, 27)>
- <13, (9, 21, 24)>
- <17, (1, 5, 6)>
- <19, (1, 4, 18)>
- <23, (0, 26, 29)>
- <26, (7, 12, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
