Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the connections for each node to identify the 3-stars.

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 6, 8, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 3, 6, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 4, 2, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 2, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 3, 6, and 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 1.

From the connections above, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<0, (7, 3, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (5, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 3, 0)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars.
So, the answer is [8].
