Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node (the center) is connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves) while they are not directly connected to each other.

Let's start by listing all 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 4, 1)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<1, (5, 4, 3)>
<3, (5, 1, 6)>
<2, (5, 1, 6)>
<8, (1, 0, 7)>
<0, (5, 8, 4)>
<7, (9, 8, 6)>
<6, (3, 2, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
