Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 10) 

Response:
Given graph:
Nodes: 15
Edges: 60

To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (2, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<13, (3, 10, 12)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 10)>
<4, (0, 11, 12)>
<12, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<11, (0, 4, 14)>
<14, (4, 11, 15)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (6, 10, 13)>
<10, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 8, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars: [15]
