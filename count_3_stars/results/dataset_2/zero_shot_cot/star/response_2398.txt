Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <9, (6, 8, 4)>
- <6, (9, 3, 4)>
- <1, (9, 3, 2)>
- <3, (5, 6, 1)>
- <4, (9, 6, 3)>
- <8, (9, 6, 0)>
- <0, (5, 6, 4)>
- <7, (5, 1, 2)>
- <2, (9, 1, 3)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [9].
