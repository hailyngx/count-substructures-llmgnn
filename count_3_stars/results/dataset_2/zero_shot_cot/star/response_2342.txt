Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 11) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 11) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 22) (0, 5) (10, 27) (10, 19) (10, 9) (11, 15) (11, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 26) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 29) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 25) (17, 29) (17, 22) (17, 7) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 18) (19, 10) (19, 26) (19, 16) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 2) (9, 10) (22, 0) (22, 17) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 14) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 21) (13, 29) (16, 19) (16, 28) (16, 3) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 2) (20, 2) (20, 6) (7, 17) (7, 25) (7, 18) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 18) (1, 24) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 20) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 20) (2, 3) (2, 21) (21, 5) (21, 2) (18, 29) (18, 7) (18, 25) (18, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars in the graph. Based on the given edges, we find the following nodes:
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 27, 0, and 11.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 15, 10, and 11.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 15, 28, and 22.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 27, 19, and 9.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 15, 27, and erna0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph using the potential centers we found. To do this, we consider all unique combinations of the center node and three other connected nodes.

Calculating the number of unique 3-stars:
- For node 15: 15 has connections with nodes 27, 0, and 11. So, <15, (27, 0, 11)> is a 3-star.
- For node 27: 27 has connections with nodes 15, 10, and 11. So, <27, (15, 10, 11)> is a 3-star.
- For node 0: 0 has connections with nodes 15, 28, and 22. So, <0, (15, 28, 22)> is a 3-star.
- For node 10: 10 has connections with nodes 27, 19, and 9. So, <10, (27, 19, 9)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <15, (27, 0, 11)>, <27, (15, 10, 11)>, <0, (15, 28, 22)>, and <10, (27, 19, 9)>.
