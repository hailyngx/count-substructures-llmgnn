Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 20) (14, 3) (14, 27) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 23) (7, 21) (7, 12) (21, 7) (21, 29) (21, 24) (20, 9) (20, 25) (25, 17) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 12) (0, 10) (0, 28) (0, 19) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 22) (29, 9) (29, 17) (29, 21) (29, 11) (26, 28) (26, 16) (26, 6) (28, 5) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 13) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 22) (18, 5) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 6) (8, 22) (13, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 27) (16, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (22, 12) (22, 19) (22, 8) (1, 11) (1, 23) (11, 29) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 16) (24, 21) (24, 8) (24, 23) (27, 14) (27, 16) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 11) (2, 4) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 1) (23, 24) (6, 26) (6, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 19, and 18.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 29, and 20.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 5, 0, and 26.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 0, and 8.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 26, 3, and 27.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 12, 19, and 8.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 29, 1, and 4.

2. Count the total number of 3-stars:
- There are 7 unique 3-stars identified in the graph.

3. List the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 19, 18)>
<9, (5, 29, 20)>
<28, (5, 0, 26)>
<19, (5, 0, 8)>
<16, (26, 3, 27)>
<22, (12, 19, 8)>
<11, (29, 1, 4)>

4. Output the final answer inside brackets:
