Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (26, 22) (26, 4) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 28) (21, 3) (21, 20) (6, 11) (2, 12) (2, 24) (29, 22) (29, 18) (10, 17) (10, 27) (10, 23) (10, 16) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 22) (20, 21) (20, 0) (20, 23) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 1) (28, 9) (28, 7) (28, 18) (22, 26) (22, 29) (22, 0) (22, 24) (5, 23) (5, 3) (13, 12) (13, 24) (3, 21) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (18, 29) (18, 28) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 25) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 27) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 12) (15, 19) (15, 4) (23, 10) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 27) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 27) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 3) (8, 25) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 23) (27, 1) (4, 26) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 15) (24, 2) (24, 22) (24, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star in the graph. Since each 3-star has one central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that have three edges connected to them.

By analyzing the edges in the graph and counting the number of 3-stars, we have:

Number of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<7, (12, 2, 28)>
<10, (17, 16, 23)>
<12, (7, 16, 1)>
<18, (19, 28, 3)>
<19, (7, 15, 25)>
<27, (10, 11, 1)>
