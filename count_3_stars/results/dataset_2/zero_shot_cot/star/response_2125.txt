Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 28) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 25) (21, 15) (10, 15) (10, 4) (11, 29) (11, 20) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 27) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 6) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 19) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 6) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 25) (19, 24) (28, 7) (28, 8) (6, 0) (6, 26) (6, 23) (15, 21) (15, 10) (15, 12) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 22) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 13) (2, 14) (22, 8) (22, 5) (5, 26) (5, 22) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 16) (12, 15) (12, 14) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 23) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 12) (29, 11) (29, 0) (18, 1) (18, 27) (18, 24) (27, 1) (27, 18) (27, 13) (13, 9) (13, 16) (13, 27) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 18) (25, 21) (25, 0) (25, 19) (23, 21) (23, 6) (23, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. Let's follow these steps:

1. Count the degree of each node in the graph.
2. Identify the nodes with a degree of 3.
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars centered at those nodes.

Let's go step by step:

1. Node degrees:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 1
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 4
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 2
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 5
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 3
- Node 17: degree 3
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 4
- Node 21: degree 4
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 3
- Node 27: degree 3
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 2

2. Nodes with degree 3: 5, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28

3. Unique 3-stars:
- <5, (22, 26, 5)>
- <7, (21, 28, 23)>
- <8, (14, 22, 8)>
- <15, (21, 10, 12)>
- <16, (7, 16, 13)>
- <17, (0, 23, 17)>
- <18, (1, 24, 27)>
- <23, (6, 17, 23)>
- <25, (0, 19, 25)>
- <26, (5, 6, 26)>
- <27, (1, 13, 27)>
- <28, (7, 8, 28)>

Count of 3-stars = 12

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
