Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 16) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 18) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 16) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 1) (19, 4) (19, 16) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 2) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 19) (16, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, creating a 3-star pattern. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (11, 12, 1)>
<2, (3, 4, 16)>
<5, (6, 7, 11)>
<9, (8, 14, 16)>
<13, (8, 17, 18)>
<15, (3, 6, 18)>
<16, (2, 4, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
