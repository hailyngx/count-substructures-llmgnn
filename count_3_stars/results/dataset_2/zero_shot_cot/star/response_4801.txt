Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 23) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 11) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 17) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 5) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 24) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 15) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 10) (20, 21) (20, 29) (29, 7) (29, 20) (29, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 27) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 16) (11, 21) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 6) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 24) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 6) (5, 22) (5, 3) (5, 12) (8, 3) (14, 1) (14, 22) (0, 15) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 24) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 19) (10, 12) (10, 13) (24, 25) (24, 15) (24, 12) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 19) (23, 1) (23, 27) (27, 16) (27, 23) (27, 9) (9, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are part of a 3-star structure.

Nodes directly connected to node 1: 4, 14, 21, 23
Nodes directly connected to node 2: 4, 15, 18
Nodes directly connected to node 3: 5, 7, 8, 25, 28
Nodes directly connected to node 4: 1, 2, 7
Nodes directly connected to node 5: 3, 12, 22
Nodes directly connected to node 6: 11, 18, 19
Nodes directly connected to node 7: 3, 4, 10, 11, 29
Nodes directly connected to node 10: 7, 10, 12, 13, 19, 28
Nodes directly connected to node 11: 6, 7, 21, 29
Nodes directly connected to node 12: 5, 10, 24
Nodes directly connected to node 15: 2, 0, 19, 24
Nodes directly connected to node 16: 17, 21, 27
Nodes directly connected to node 17: 16, 22, 25, 28
Nodes directly connected to node 18: 2, 6, 12, 22
Nodes directly connected to node 19: 6, 10, 15
Nodes directly connected to node 21: 1, 11, 16, 20
Nodes directly connected to node 22: 5, 17, 18
Nodes directly connected to node 24: 12, 15, 25
Nodes directly connected to node 25: 3, 17, 24
Nodes directly connected to node 27: 16, 23, 9
Nodes directly connected to node 28: 3, 10, 17
Nodes directly connected to node 29: 7, 11, 20

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (4, 14, 21)>
<7, (3, 10, 29)>
<11, (6, 7, 21)>
<12, (5, 10, 24)>
<15, (0, 19, 24)>
<16, (17, 21, 27)>
<17, (16, 22, 28)>
<18, (2, 6, 22)>
<25, (3, 17, 24)>
<27, (16, 23, 9)>
<28, (3, 10, 17)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
