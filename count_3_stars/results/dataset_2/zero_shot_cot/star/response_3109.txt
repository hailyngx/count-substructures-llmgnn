Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (3, 5) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by listing out the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<7, (4, 2, 9)>
<2, (7, 5, 8)>
<5, (7, 2, 3)>
<6, (14, 10, 11)>
<8, (6, 2, 9)>
<3, (5, 2, 11)>
<11, (6, 8, 14)>
<9, (7, 2, 8)>
<0, (4, 9, 10)>
<10, (6, 0, 1)>
<14, (7, 6, 11)>
<1, (11, 10, 14)>
<13, (11, 12, 1)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we find that there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
