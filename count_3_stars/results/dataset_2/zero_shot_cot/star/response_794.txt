Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars one by one:
1. Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 0) -> <4, (7, 6, 0)>
2. Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 2) -> <7, (4, 3, 6)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 9, 2)>
3. Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9) -> <6, (4, 7, 9)>
4. Node 9: (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3) -> <9, (7, 6, 2)>, <9, (7, 6, 3)>
5. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0) -> <1, (3, 2, 0)>
6. Node 3: (3, 7), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8) -> <3, (7, 9, 1)>, <3, (7, 9, 5)>, <3, (7, 9, 8)>
7. Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 5) -> <8, (1, 3, 2)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (3, 2, 5)>
8. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 8), (5, 2) -> <5, (3, 8, 2)>
9. Node 2: (2, 7), (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8), (2, 5), (2, 0) -> <2, (7, 9, 1)>, <2, (7, 9, 8)>, <2, (7, 9, 5)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: 13
So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
