Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes to find the 3-stars.

The central nodes must have exactly 3 edges connected to them.
From the given edges:
- Node 4 has 5 edges connected to it.
- Node 7 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 1 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 3 has 5 edges connected to it.
- Node 6 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected to it.
- Node 8 has 5 edges connected to it.
- Node 5 has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 0 has 7 edges connected to it.
- Node 2 has 2 edges connected to it.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:
- Node 7, (8, 6, 0) - as it has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 6, (7, 2, 0) - as it has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 5, (4, 8, 0) - as it has 3 edges connected to it.
- Node 2, (3, 6, 0) - as it has 3 edges connected to it.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.
Therefore, the answer is [4].
