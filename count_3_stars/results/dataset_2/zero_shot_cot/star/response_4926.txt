Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to the center node of the 3-stars. These nodes will have exactly three edges connected to them in the graph.

The nodes with 3 edges connected to them are:
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 6, 9, and 8)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 6, 8, and 12)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 7, 0, and 1)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 6, 4, and 6)
- Node 11 (connected to nodes 9, 4, and 1)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 7, 12, and 3)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 3, 13, and 5)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 12, 11, and 14)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 4, 8, and 0)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 9, 8, and 10)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 6, 10, and 14)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [5]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <6, (7, 9, 8)>
- <3, (6, 8, 12)>
- <12, (7, 0, 1)>
- <10, (3, 13, 5)>
- <14, (9, 8, 10)>
