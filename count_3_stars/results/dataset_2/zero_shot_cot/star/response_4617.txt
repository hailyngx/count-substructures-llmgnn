Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 7) (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (1, 17) (1, 2) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 4) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 4) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 15) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (3, 12) (3, 18) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 15) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. (5, 6, 13)
2. (8, 2, 12)
3. (13, 8, 19)
4. (2, 19, 15)
5. (12, 16, 3)
6. (16, 9, 4)

Hence, there are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [6].
