Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 7) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 0) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 9) (20, 24) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 28) (0, 29) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 19) (4, 23) (4, 1) (8, 28) (8, 19) (8, 21) (3, 21) (3, 26) (11, 13) (11, 15) (6, 29) (6, 20) (6, 21) (6, 26) (21, 8) (21, 3) (21, 6) (21, 12) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 24) (19, 0) (19, 8) (19, 15) (10, 15) (10, 22) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 10) (15, 18) (16, 17) (16, 9) (28, 25) (28, 8) (28, 26) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 10) (22, 17) (14, 26) (14, 13) (26, 3) (26, 6) (26, 28) (26, 14) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 22) (7, 2) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 1) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 9) (12, 21) (12, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 18) (24, 20) (24, 5) (27, 9) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 13) (9, 20) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 27) (1, 4) (1, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

Let's first list the nodes each node is connected to:
1. Node 0 is connected to: 29, 20, 22, 19
2. Node 1 is connected to: 4, 7
3. Node 2 is connected to: 29, 22, 7
4. Node 3 is connected to: 21, 26
5. Node 4 is connected to: 23, 1
6. Node 5 is connected to: 23, 12, 24
7. Node 6 is connected to: 29, 20, 21, 26
8. Node 7 is connected to: 2, 29, 18, 1
9. Node 8 is connected to: 28, 19, 21
10. Node 9 is connected to: 20, 16, 23, 27
11. Node 10 is connected to: 15, 22
12. Node 11 is connected to: 13, 15
13. Node 12 is connected to: 21, 5
14. Node 13 is connected to: 11, 14, 18
15. Node 14 is connected to: 26, 13
16. Node 15 is connected to: 11, 19, 10, 18
17. Node 16 is connected to: 17, 9
18. Node 17 is connected to: 25, 16, 22
19. Node 18 is connected to: 15, 7, 13
20. Node 19 is connected to: 0, 8, 15
21. Node 20 is connected to: 25, 0, 9, 24, 6
22. Node 21 is connected to: 8, 3, 6, 12
23. Node 22 is connected to: 2, 0, 10, 17
24. Node 23 is connected to: 9, 5
25. Node 24 is connected to: 20, 5
26. Node 26 is connected to: 3, 6, 28, 14
27. Node 27 is connected to: 9
28. Node 28 is connected to: 25, 8, 26
29. Node 29 is connected to: 2, 7, 6, 0

Now, we list the 3-stars:
<0, (29, 20, 22)>
<6, (29, 20, 21)>
<9, (20, 16, 23)>
<15, (19, 10, 18)>
<20, (25, 9, 24)>
<22, (17, 16, 0)>
<26, (3, 28, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
