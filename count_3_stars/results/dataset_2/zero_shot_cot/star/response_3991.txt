Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's list the 3-star patterns:
<0, (14, 8, 5)>
<1, (11, 4, 5)>
<2, (9, 8, 4)>
<3, (7, 13, 10)>
<4, (12, 14, 3)>
<5, (0, 5, 1)>
<7, (13, 3, 7)>
<8, (12, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 9, 1)>
<10, (5, 4, 10)>
<11, (8, 1, 13)>
<12, (14, 4, 5)>
<13, (7, 9, 13)>
<14, (12, 0, 4)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
