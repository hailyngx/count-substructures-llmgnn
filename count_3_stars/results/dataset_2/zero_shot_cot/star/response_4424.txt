Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (2, 8) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 9) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (14, 1) (14, 18) (13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Starting with the given edges:
(11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18)
(16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15)
(5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3)
(9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17)
(4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15)
(7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0)
(12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15)
(8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19)
(17, 1)
(0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13)
(15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 12)
(19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13)
(18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 14)
(3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13)
(10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6)
(6, 3) (6, 10)
(14, 1) (14, 18)
(13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 3)

From the edge list, we observe the following 3-stars:
<11, (16, 19, 0)>
<16, (11, 8, 19)>
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<9, (5, 18, 17)>
<4, (7, 12, 15)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<12, (4, 7, 10)>
<8, (16, 2, 19)>
<17, (1)>
<0, (11, 5, 7)>
<15, (16, 4, 12)>
<19, (11, 16, 8)>
<18, (11, 9, 14)>
<3, (5, 10, 6)>
<10, (12, 3, 6)>
<6, (3, 10)>
<14, (1, 18)>
<13, (0, 19, 3)>

Hence, there are 18 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
The final answer is: [18].
