Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 15) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 1) (10, 17) (10, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) (18, 16) (18, 6) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 7) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (7, 16) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 0) (12, 2) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 14) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 13) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three leaf nodes.

Let's first identify all the possible 3-stars:

<3, (16, 14, 13)>
<0, (10, 12, 2)>
<1, (17, 4, 7)>
<17, (11, 10, 1)>
<2, (4, 0, 12)>
<6, (9, 15, 18)>
<11, (16, 8, 17)>
<12, (1, 19, 0)>
<14, (9, 3, 15)>
<15, (5, 6, 14)>
<16, (11, 7, 18)>
<4, (2, 1, 17)>
<5, (9, 15, 6)>
<9, (5, 14, 6)>
<7, (16, 1, 8)>
<8, (11, 7, 19)>
<10, (17, 0, 11)>
<13, (3, 3, 3)>
<18, (16, 6, 18)>
<19, (8, 12, 7)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars: [20]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [20].
