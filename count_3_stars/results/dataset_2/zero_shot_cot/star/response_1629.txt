Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 16) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (17, 12) (17, 13) (0, 10) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 18) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 16) (11, 12) (11, 0) (3, 19) (3, 14) (14, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars one by one:

<2, (8, 1, 16)>
<4, (10, 0, 18)>
<5, (9, 13, 17)>
<6, (7, 0, 6)>
<12, (9, 7, 17)>
<15, (2, 13, 19)>
<16, (2, 0, 18)>
<17, (12, 13, 18)>
<18, (13, 16, 18)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars: [9].
