Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 24) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 7) (9, 23) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 29) (14, 25) (21, 9) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 20) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 17) (1, 15) (1, 25) (18, 26) (18, 12) (18, 8) (2, 14) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 10) (22, 2) (24, 15) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 20) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 29) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 12) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 17) (25, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (13, 11) (13, 20) (13, 19) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 5) (27, 10) (27, 19) (29, 14) (29, 26) (29, 10) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 27) (20, 11) (20, 23) (20, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 5) (4, 0) (4, 28) (4, 25) (4, 5) (16, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify which nodes can be considered as the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with exactly three neighbors.

Here are the nodes that have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 15 (neighbors: 3, 1, 24)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 9, 11, 8)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 6, 21, 7)
- Node 0 (neighbors: 14, 11, 4)
- Node 14 (neighbors: 0, 2, 29)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 9, 28, 10)
- Node 28 (neighbors: 21, 11, 4)
- Node 11 (neighbors: 6, 0, 28)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 18, 23, 29)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 15, 25, None) - only has two neighbors

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<6, (9, 11, 8)>
<(6, (9, 21, 7)>
<9, (6, 21, 7)>
<0, (14, 11, 4)>
<(0, (14, 2, 29)>
<14, (0, 2, 29)>
<21, (9, 28, 10)>
<(21, 9, 7)>
<28, (21, 11, 4)>
<11, (6, 0, 28)>
<26, (18, 23, 29)>
<(26, (18, 12, 8)>
<1, (15, 25, None)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
