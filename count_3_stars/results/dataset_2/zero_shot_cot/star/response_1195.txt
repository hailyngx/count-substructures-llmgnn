Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 0: 10, 11, 7, 3
Node 1: 10, 4, 5, 12, 14
Node 2: 6, 13, 7, 3
Node 3: 9, 13, 0, 12, 2
Node 4: 6, 9, 12, 14, 1
Node 5: 6, 8, 12, 1
Node 6: 9, 5, 2, 4, 13
Node 7: 11, 0, 2
Node 8: 9, 10, 13, 5
Node 9: 6, 8, 4, 3
Node 10: 0, 12, 8, 1
Node 11: 7, 0
Node 12: 10, 4, 5, 3, 1
Node 13: 6, 8, 2, 3
Node 14: 4, 1

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are <13, (9, 8, 6)>, <4, (9, 5, 6)>, and <3, (9, 13, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
