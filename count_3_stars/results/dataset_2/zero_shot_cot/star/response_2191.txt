Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 11) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition. Since a 3-star has a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The central nodes for the 3-stars are: 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 8, 13, 4, 7, 12, 0, 14, 2, 11, 10.

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.

[15] 3-star graphs

<5, (12, 1, 11)>
<9, (6, 11, 10)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 3, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 10)>
<8, (13, 4, 7)>
<13, (9, 8, 11)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>
<7, (6, 1, 8)>
<12, (5, 2, 10)>
<0, (9, 1, 14)>
<14, (13, 12, 0)>
<2, (1, 4, 12)>
<11, (5, 9, 13)>
<10, (9, 3, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
