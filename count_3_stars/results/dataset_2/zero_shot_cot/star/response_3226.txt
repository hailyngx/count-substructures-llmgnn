Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 27) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 20) (21, 26) (21, 17) (2, 18) (29, 13) (29, 22) (0, 16) (0, 18) (27, 1) (27, 25) (27, 14) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 22) (13, 29) (13, 8) (13, 20) (13, 9) (10, 12) (10, 9) (17, 21) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 3) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 3) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 5) (20, 21) (20, 13) (20, 17) (20, 23) (20, 5) (16, 0) (16, 28) (16, 19) (16, 5) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 7) (11, 6) (23, 20) (23, 15) (14, 27) (14, 24) (26, 21) (26, 25) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 28) (3, 19) (3, 12) (19, 4) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 22) (19, 7) (22, 1) (22, 29) (22, 8) (22, 19) (22, 7) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (25, 27) (25, 26) (25, 24) (15, 23) (24, 14) (24, 25) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 28) (7, 28) (7, 19) (7, 22) (5, 4) (5, 20) (5, 16) (6, 11) 

Response:
To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will form the centers of the 3-stars.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (21, 27, 22)>
<21, (1, 20, 26)>
<21, (17, 1, 26)>
<2, (18, 0, 4)>
<29, (13, 22, 8)>
<0, (16, 18, 5)>
<27, (1, 25, 14)>
<8, (13, 17, 22)>
<13, (29, 20, 8)>
<10, (12, 9, 3)>
<17, (21, 8, 20)>
<18, (2, 0, 3)>
<4, (18, 12, 19)>
<20, (21, 13, 17)>
<16, (0, 28, 5)>
<28, (16, 3, 9)>
<11, (6, 7, 12)>
<23, (20, 15, 5)>
<14, (27, 24, 25)>
<26, (21, 25, 25)>
<3, (17, 18, 28)>
<19, (4, 16, 3)>
<22, (1, 29, 8)>
<12, (10, 4, 3)>
<25, (27, 26, 24)>
<15, (23, 20, 6)>
<24, (14, 25, 27)>
<9, (13, 10, 28)>
<7, (28, 19, 22)>
<5, (4, 20, 16)>
<6, (11, 15, 15)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we get a total of [31] 3-stars.
