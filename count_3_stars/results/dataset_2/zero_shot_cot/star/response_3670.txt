Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 24) (2, 5) (2, 29) (2, 11) (29, 9) (29, 2) (29, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 25) (22, 26) (22, 4) (23, 0) (23, 20) (10, 29) (10, 17) (10, 0) (11, 2) (11, 14) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 20) (18, 17) (18, 15) (19, 14) (26, 22) (26, 16) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 1) (6, 21) (6, 25) (6, 15) (28, 25) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 8) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 26) (0, 23) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 27) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 27) (8, 3) (24, 9) (24, 12) (3, 14) (3, 8) (1, 13) (1, 25) (1, 12) (1, 27) (25, 21) (25, 13) (25, 6) (25, 28) (25, 1) (12, 13) (12, 24) (12, 1) (20, 21) (20, 23) (20, 4) (27, 14) (27, 8) (27, 1) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes which have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (9, 2, 13)>
<9, (5, 29, 8)>
<2, (5, 29, 11)>
<29, (9, 2, 10)>
<7, (21, 16, 15)>
<21, (7, 6, 20)>
<22, (26, 4, 0)>
<23, (0, 20, 14)>
<10, (29, 17, 0)>
<11, (2, 14, 0)>
<17, (10, 18, 0)>
<4, (22, 16, 20)>
<18, (17, 15, 0)>
<19, (14, 0, 0)>
<26, (22, 16, 0)>
<13, (5, 12, 25)>
<6, (21, 25, 15)>
<28, (25, 0, 0)>
<0, (23, 10, 14)>
<14, (11, 19, 0)>
<8, (9, 15, 0)>
<24, (12, 0, 0)>
<3, (14, 8, 0)>
<1, (13, 25, 12)>
<27, (14, 8, 1)>

There are 26 unique 3-stars in the graph as listed above. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
