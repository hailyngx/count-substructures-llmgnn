Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 15) (2, 29) (2, 12) (29, 1) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 3) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (22, 11) (22, 5) (23, 0) (23, 20) (23, 9) (0, 21) (0, 7) (0, 23) (20, 23) (20, 3) (20, 11) (26, 4) (26, 13) (18, 16) (18, 12) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 27) (3, 29) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 22) (11, 20) (11, 3) (11, 19) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 11) (19, 5) (25, 24) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 16) (12, 24) (12, 14) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 12) (16, 10) (10, 16) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 14) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 15) (9, 21) (9, 23) (14, 1) (14, 29) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 14) (8, 24) (24, 25) (24, 12) (24, 8) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 28) (28, 15) (27, 13) 

Response:
There are <1, (14, 29, 4)>, <21, (15, 2, 0)>, <7, (0, 8, 4)>, <22, (11, 5, 1)>, <23, (0, 9, 20)>, <20, (23, 3, 11)>, <26, (4, 13, 7)>, <18, (16, 12, 2)>, <13, (27, 16, 26)>, <3, (6, 20, 11)>, <11, (3, 19, 22)>, <5, (19, 15, 22)>, <19, (5, 11, 10)>, <12, (24, 14, 16)>, <8, (24, 14, 17)>, <15, (28, 21, 5)>, and <24, (25, 8, 12)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
