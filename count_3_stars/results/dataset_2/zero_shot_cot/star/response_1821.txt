Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 22) (15, 24) (2, 29) (2, 1) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 14) (29, 24) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 26) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 6) (26, 3) (26, 8) (26, 18) (1, 2) (1, 7) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 16) (5, 24) (5, 20) (19, 22) (19, 25) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 27) (12, 25) (12, 6) (16, 13) (16, 21) (16, 0) (16, 22) (22, 15) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 27) (22, 20) (0, 15) (0, 16) (0, 23) (11, 13) (7, 1) (27, 9) (27, 22) (27, 6) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 27) (6, 25) (24, 15) (24, 29) (24, 5) (14, 29) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 23) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 14) (25, 19) (25, 12) (25, 6) (25, 28) (28, 2) (28, 25) (28, 20) (23, 10) (23, 0) (23, 14) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 28) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, which are potential central nodes for 3-star graphs:
- Node 3 has 4 incident edges
- Node 15 has 4 incident edges
- Node 2 has 3 incident edges
- Node 29 has 3 incident edges
- Node 10 has 4 incident edges
- Node 17 has 4 incident edges
- Node 4 has 3 incident edges
- Node 8 has 4 incident edges
- Node 13 has 3 incident edges
- Node 26 has 3 incident edges
- Node 21 has 3 incident edges (This means 21 can be a central node in two 3-star graphs)
- Node 10 has 4 incident edges
- Node 22 has 5 incident edges (This means 22 can be a central node in four 3-star graphs)
- Node 16 has 4 incident edges

Now, let's list the unique 3-star graphs found:
<3, (15, 21, 26)>
<2, (29, 1, 28)>
<10, (17, 21, 8)>
<4, (17, 8, 26)>
<13, (16, 11, 6)>
<21, (3, 10, 16)>
<22, (15, 19, 27)>
<22, (16, 27, 20)>
<22, (22, 20, 28)>
<22, (22, 27, 22)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [9]
