Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 5) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 6) (15, 27) (15, 20) (27, 13) (27, 15) (27, 3) (27, 9) (2, 29) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 14) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 27) (9, 12) (9, 14) (23, 25) (23, 1) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 0) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 29) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 10) (20, 15) (20, 1) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 25) (26, 11) (26, 17) (26, 7) (24, 8) (24, 21) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 26) (16, 17) (16, 18) (17, 26) (17, 16) (17, 25) (17, 3) (17, 28) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 10) (12, 2) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (4, 2) (4, 21) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 18) (3, 27) (3, 0) (3, 17) (1, 23) (1, 20) (1, 8) (1, 11) (28, 17) (28, 10) (18, 16) (18, 11) (10, 14) (10, 25) (10, 28) (21, 5) (21, 24) (21, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node by exactly three edges to form 3-stars.

From node 13: (13, 22), (13, 5), (13, 27)
From node 27: (27, 15), (27, 9), (27, 13)
From node 2: (2, 29), (2, 12), (2, 19)
From node 29: (29, 2), (29, 14), - 
From node 6: (6, 22), (6, 5), (6, 7)
From node 9: (9, 27), (9, 12), (9, 14)
From node 5: (5, 13), (5, 6), (5, 12)
From node 0: (0, 5), (0, 14), (0, 3)
From node 14: (14, 29), (14, 9), (14, 0)
From node 20: (20, 15), (20, 1), -
From node 19: (19, 2), (19, 8), (19, 25)
From node 7: (7, 6), (7, 26), -
From node 17: (17, 26), (17, 16), (17, 25)
From node 25: (25, 23), (25, 19), (25, 17)
From node 12: (12, 2), (12, 9), (12, 5)
From node 11: (11, 26), (11, 1), (11, 18)
From node 1: (1, 23), (1, 20), (1, 8)
From node 10: (10, 14), (10, 25), (10, 28)
From node 21: (21, 5), (21, 24), (21, 4)

Therefore, there are 21 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The answer is [21].
<2, (29, 14, -)>, <3, (0, 17, -)>, <4, (21, 5, -)>, <5, (6, 12, 13)>, <6, (5, 7, 22)>, <7, (6, 26, -)>, <8, (1, 12, 19)>, <9, (12, 14, 27)>, <10, (14, 25, 28)>, <11, (1, 18, 26)>, <13, (5, 22, 27)>, <14, (0, 9, 29)>, <15, (9, 13, 27)>, <16, (17, 18, -)>, <17, (16, 25, 26)>, <19, (2, 8, 25)>, <20, (1, 15, -)>, <21, (4, 5, 24)>, <25, (17, 19, 23)>, <27, (13, 15, 27)>, <29, (2, 14, -)>
