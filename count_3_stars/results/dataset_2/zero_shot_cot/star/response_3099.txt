Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (6, 3, 5)>
<3, (9, 1, 4)>
<4, (9, 3, 5)>
<8, (6, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 4, 1)>
<2, (9, 1, 8)>
<0, (9, 8, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 1)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we find a total of [10] 3-stars.
