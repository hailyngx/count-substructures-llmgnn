Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes could potentially be the central node of a 3-star.
2. For each of these nodes, check if the other connected nodes are connected to each other. If they are, then the central node and the two connected nodes form a 3-star.
3. Count all unique 3-stars found.

Let's start by identifying the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 0 has 3 connected edges: (5, 0), (1, 0), (6, 0)
- Node 2 has 2 connected edges: (4, 2), (7, 2)
- Node 6 has 2 connected edges: (5, 6), (1, 6)

Now, let's check if the other connected nodes are connected to each other for each of these nodes:

For Node 0:
- (5, 0), (1, 0), and (6, 0) are all connected. Therefore, <0, (5, 1, 6)> forms a 3-star.

For Node 2 and Node 6:
- There are no 3-stars involving Node 2 nor Node 6.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
The unique 3-star found is <0, (5, 1, 6)>.
