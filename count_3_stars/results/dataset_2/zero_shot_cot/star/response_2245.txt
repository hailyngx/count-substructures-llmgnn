Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 10) (15, 27) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 22) (27, 26) (27, 19) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 12) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 25) (8, 22) (13, 8) (13, 2) (26, 27) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 25) (4, 16) (4, 22) (4, 23) (18, 9) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 29) (17, 23) (17, 7) (29, 26) (29, 17) (29, 3) (29, 14) (3, 29) (3, 14) (3, 23) (3, 12) (24, 26) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (19, 27) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 25) (22, 27) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 10) (7, 11) (7, 17) (7, 5) (14, 29) (14, 3) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 20) (2, 28) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 22) (10, 12) (10, 28) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 10) (20, 8) (20, 2) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 19) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 3) (28, 2) (28, 10) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list out the 3-star structures we find in the graph:
<2, (9, 13, 20)>
<3, (12, 14, 23)>
<5, (0, 7, 10)>
<6, (9, 12, 19)>
<7, (5, 11, 17)>
<8, (13, 16, 20)>
<9, (2, 6, 18)>
<10, (5, 16, 22)>
<12, (3, 6, 15)>
<16, (4, 8, 10)>
<17, (7, 9, 23)>
<19, (5, 19, 25)>
<20, (2, 8, 20)>
<22, (4, 8, 22)>
<23, (3, 17, 23)>
<25, (8, 19, 25)>
<26, (24, 27, 29)>
<27, (15, 19, 22)>
<28, (2, 10, 28)>
<29, (3, 17, 29)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars present in the graph.
