Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 10) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 13) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 9) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 9), (1, 12)
   <1, (3, 9, 12)>

2. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 2)
   <3, (1, 7, 2)>

3. Node 5: (5, 3), (5, 10)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it only has 2 edges.

4. Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 12), (6, 8)
   <6, (2, 12, 8)>

5. Node 0: (0, 14), (0, 7), (0, 11), (0, 4), (0, 13)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has more than 3 edges.

6. Node 14: (14, 0), (14, 11), (14, 8), (14, 7)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has more than 3 edges.

7. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 0), (7, 14), (7, 11), (7, 10), (7, 13)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has more than 3 edges.

8. Node 11: (11, 0), (11, 14), (11, 7), (11, 9), (11, 4)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has more than 3 edges.

9. Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 14), (8, 10)
   <8, (6, 14, 10)>

10. Node 2: (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 10)
   <2, (3, 6, 9)>

11. Node 9: (9, 1), (9, 11), (9, 2), (9, 13)
   <9, (1, 11, 2)>

12. Node 12: (12, 1), (12, 6)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it only has 2 edges.

13. Node 13: (13, 6), (13, 0), (13, 7), (13, 9)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has more than 3 edges.

14. Node 10: (10, 5), (10, 7), (10, 8), (10, 2), (10, 4)
   Cannot form a 3-star as it has more than 3 edges.

15. Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 0), (4, 11), (4, 10)
   <4, (3, 0, 11)>

The unique 3-stars identified are: 
<1, (3, 9, 12)>, <3, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (2, 12, 8)>, <8, (6, 14, 10)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 11, 2)>, <4, (3, 0, 11)>

There are total 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The answer is [7].
