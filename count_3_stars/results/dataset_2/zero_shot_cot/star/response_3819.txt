Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 1) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the unique 3-stars. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 7, 0)>
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<8, (9, 13, 12)>
<13, (8, 5, 11)>
<7, (6, 8, 14)>
<12, (9, 8, 1)>
<5, (13, 1, 3)>
<0, (6, 14, 11)>
<14, (9, 7, 0)>
<2, (9, 8, 14)>
<10, (13, 1, 11)>
<3, (6, 7, 12)>
<1, (12, 5, 2)>
<11, (13, 0, 1)>
<4, (0, 3, 11)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars.
