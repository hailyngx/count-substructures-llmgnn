Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <5, (9, 2, 10)>
2. <9, (5, 8, 4)>
3. <4, (9, 8, 13)>
4. <8, (9, 4, 3)>
5. <0, (14, 3, 1)>
6. <14, (5, 4, 0)>
7. <13, (5, 4, 12)>
8. <2, (5, 1, 3)>
9. <12, (13, 10, 6)>
10. <10, (5, 9, 12)>
11. <3, (8, 0, 2)>
12. <7, (2, 3, 1)>
13. <1, (2, 14, 7)>
14. <11, (9, 1, 6)>
15. <6, (12, 10, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
