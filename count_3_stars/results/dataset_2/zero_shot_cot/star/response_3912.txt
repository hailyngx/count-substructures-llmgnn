Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 3) (1, 21) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 19) (21, 25) (21, 2) (2, 21) (2, 29) (2, 19) (29, 2) (29, 17) (0, 20) (0, 23) (27, 20) (27, 9) (27, 5) (8, 10) (8, 25) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 25) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 15) (17, 29) (17, 10) (17, 24) (20, 0) (20, 27) (20, 28) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 15) (9, 1) (9, 27) (9, 18) (9, 16) (26, 28) (26, 6) (26, 7) (28, 11) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 23) (3, 22) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 16) (4, 15) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 24) (7, 1) (7, 26) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 12) (18, 9) (18, 6) (19, 21) (19, 2) (19, 24) (6, 10) (6, 26) (6, 18) (24, 17) (24, 12) (24, 19) (23, 0) (23, 28) (23, 4) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 10) (15, 11) (15, 5) (15, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the given edges and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 12. <1, (7, 9, 12)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 19, 21, and 29. <2, (19, 21, 29)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 22. <3, (4, 11, 22)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 15. <4, (3, 12, 15)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 17, and 25. <10, (6, 17, 25)>
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5. <12, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 4.<16, (9, 12, 4)>
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 24, and 29. <17, (10, 24, 29)>
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 0, 27, and 28. <20, (0, 27, 28)>
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 19, 25, and 2. <21, (19, 25, 2)>
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 13, 3, and 2. <22, (13, 3, 2)>
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 28. <26, (6, 7, 28)>
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 20. <27, (5, 9, 20)>

Now we calculate the number of unique 3-stars: 
- There are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [13].
