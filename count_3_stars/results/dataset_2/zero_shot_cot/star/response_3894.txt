Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 10) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 11) (22, 12) (8, 23) (8, 28) (8, 25) (8, 17) (23, 8) (23, 24) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 10) (26, 1) (26, 21) (0, 14) (0, 21) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (4, 18) (4, 14) (15, 2) (15, 16) (20, 6) (21, 2) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 28) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 24) (17, 8) (17, 25) (17, 5) (17, 7) (25, 8) (25, 17) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 24) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 29) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 17) (7, 3) (24, 23) (24, 28) (24, 25) (6, 20) (6, 3) (6, 29) (6, 11) (29, 10) (29, 6) (29, 19) (19, 13) (19, 29) (19, 12) (27, 22) (27, 11) (27, 16) (9, 16) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 27) (16, 9) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 11) (11, 22) (11, 6) (11, 27) (11, 5) (12, 22) (12, 19)
