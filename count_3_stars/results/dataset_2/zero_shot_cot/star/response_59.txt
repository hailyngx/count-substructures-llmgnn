Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 8) (12, 10) (27, 26) (27, 19) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 22) (29, 28) (29, 25) (29, 13) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (3, 11) (3, 23) (3, 19) (16, 28) (16, 8) (26, 27) (26, 5) (26, 20) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 10) (21, 25) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 26) (6, 19) (6, 20) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 22) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 22) (25, 10) (25, 29) (25, 23) (25, 21) (20, 26) (20, 6) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (19, 27) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (13, 29) (13, 15) (24, 1) (24, 17) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 7) (14, 4) (14, 23) (22, 28) (22, 17) (22, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the node with the most edges. In this case, node 10 has the most edges (5 edges).

The nodes connected to node 10 are: 11, 21, 12, 1, 25
Let's check if they form any 3-stars:

- For node 11: (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 5) --> <11, (10, 3, 23)>
- For node 21: (10, 21) (21, 25) --> <21, (10, 25, 21)>
- For node 12: (10, 12)
- For node 1: (10, 1) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 8) --> <1, (10, 15, 24)>
- For node 25: (10, 25) (25, 29) (25, 23) (25, 21) --> <25, (10, 29, 21)>

Now, we have found all 3-stars. Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get [4]. Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <11, (10, 3, 23)>, <21, (10, 25, 21)>, <1, (10, 15, 24)>, <25, (10, 29, 21)> inside brackets [].
