Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

By observing the edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<1, (2, 3, 5)>
<3, (1, 8, 12)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 12)>
<8, (3, 5, 14)>
<9, (0, 10, 11)>
<11, (4, 9, 12)>
<12, (3, 7, 11)>
<13, (0, 10, 11)>
<14, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
