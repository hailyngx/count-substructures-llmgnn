Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 28) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 25) (4, 27) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 19) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 22) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 5) (17, 29) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 21) (29, 17) (29, 13) (29, 25) (29, 22) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 14) (28, 15) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 20) (22, 1) (22, 26) (22, 29) (22, 21) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 22) (21, 16) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 20) (0, 11) (0, 17) (0, 8) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 9) (25, 27) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 24) (16, 10) (16, 21) (5, 12) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 8) (5, 20) (2, 7) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 5) (14, 6) (14, 23) (3, 19) (19, 12) (19, 3) (9, 11) (9, 23) (9, 24) (13, 29) (13, 25) (20, 28) (20, 18) (20, 5) (24, 17) (24, 25) (24, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's start by looking for all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. (1, 15, 28, 26)
2. (7, 4, 2, 8)
3. (10, 1, 16, 26)
4. (11, 23, 0, 9)
5. (12, 27, 5, 19)
6. (17, 29, 21, 24)
7. (21, 17, 6, 28)
8. (22, 1, 26, 29)
9. (25, 27, 13, 24)
10. (26, 1, 22, 18)
11. (29, 17, 25, 22)
12. (5, 12, 26, 18)
13. (8, 7, 0, 5)
14. (14, 6, 23, 28)

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [14]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (15, 28, 26)>
<7, (4, 2, 8)>
<10, (1, 16, 26)>
<11, (23, 0, 9)>
<12, (27, 5, 19)>
<17, (29, 21, 24)>
<21, (17, 6, 28)>
<22, (1, 26, 29)>
<25, (27, 13, 24)>
<26, (1, 22, 18)>
<29, (17, 25, 22)>
<5, (12, 26, 18)>
<8, (7, 0, 5)>
<14, (6, 23, 28)>
