Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 23) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 20) (14, 4) (17, 1) (17, 11) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 23) (8, 9) (23, 9) (23, 6) (23, 29) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 7) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 19) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 17) (11, 2) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 4) (25, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 25) (22, 27) (22, 28) (22, 10) (16, 5) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 18) (21, 16) (21, 19) (21, 18) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 22) (24, 5) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 7) (24, 1) (4, 14) (4, 25) (15, 6) (26, 25) (26, 29) (20, 27) (29, 0) (29, 23) (29, 26) (13, 7) (13, 16) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 21) (28, 22) (28, 19) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present. 
Let's list down the 3-stars by looking at each node and its neighbors:

<0, (9, 27, 10)>
<1, (17, 24, 19)>
<2, (5, 3, 25)>
<5, (9, 12, 16)>
<6, (9, 24, 15)>
<7, (12, 25, 13)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<10, (0, 22, 1)>
<16, (5, 21, 13)>
<17, (1, 11, 19)>
<18, (1, 21, 16)>
<19, (1, 18, 28)>
<22, (27, 28, 10)>
<23, (9, 6, 29)>
<24, (5, 27, 7)>
<25, (7, 2, 26)>
<26, (25, 29, None)>
<27, (0, 22, 20)>
<28, (22, 19, None)>
<29, (0, 23, 26)>

After listing the unique 3-stars, we can count them to find the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
