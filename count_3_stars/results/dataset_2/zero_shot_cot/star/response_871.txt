Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 9) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 3) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 17) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 6) 

Response:
In this graph, a 3-star is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the nodes to find all the 3-stars.

Node 0: (0, 16, 4, 17)
Node 1: (1, 15, 5)
Node 2: (2, 3, 4, 11)
Node 3: (3, 13, 19, 6)
Node 4: (4, 2, 0, 19)
Node 5: (5, 15, 19, 7)
Node 6: (6, 18, 3, 14)
Node 7: (7, 8, 5, 18)
Node 8: (8, 13, 7, 17)
Node 9: (9, 10, 16, 17)
Node 10: (10, 19, 9, 12)
Node 11: (11, 13, 0, 2)
Node 12: (12, 10, 11)
Node 13: (13, 3, 11, 8)
Node 14: (14, 6)
Node 15: (15, 1, 5)
Node 16: (16, 0, 9)
Node 17: (17, 8, 6, 9)
Node 18: (18, 6, 7)
Node 19: (19, 5, 4, 3)

Therefore, there are 13 unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (16, 4, 17)>
<1, (15, 5, 19)>
<2, (3, 4, 11)>
<3, (13, 19, 6)>
<4, (2, 0, 19)>
<5, (15, 19, 7)>
<6, (18, 3, 14)>
<7, (8, 5, 18)>
<8, (13, 7, 17)>
<9, (10, 16, 17)>
<10, (19, 9, 12)>
<11, (13, 0, 2)>
<12, (10, 11, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
