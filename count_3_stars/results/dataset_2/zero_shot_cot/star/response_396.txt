Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Central node 0: (1, 3, 4)
2. Central node 1: (0, 3, 4)
3. Central node 2: (6, 8, 9)
4. Central node 3: (0, 1, 6)
5. Central node 4: (0, 1, 6)
6. Central node 5: (1, 6, 7)
7. Central node 6: (1, 3, 5)
8. Central node 7: (4, 6, 1)
9. Central node 8: (0, 2, 9)
10. Central node 9: (0, 2, 8)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have the following:

<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (4, 6, 1)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
