Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<5, (9, 6, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 12)>
<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<1, (6, 3, 7)>
<3, (6, 1, 10)>
<10, (5, 9, 3)>
<4, (3, 7, 14)>
<7, (5, 1, 4)>
<13, (1, 3, 11)>
<0, (1, 3, 0)>
<14, (11, 4, 2)>
<12, (9, 11, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 13)>
<11, (14, 13, 12)>
<8, (7, 13, 12)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
