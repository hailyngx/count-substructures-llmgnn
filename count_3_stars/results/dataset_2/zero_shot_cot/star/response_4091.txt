Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These would be the potential centers of the 3-stars. The nodes meeting this criteria are: 0, 1, 3, and 5.

Next, let's check each potential center node and count the number of 3-stars. 

For the center node 0:
- (0, 4, 7, 9) is a potential 3-star as node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9.
- (0, 3, 6, 9) is a potential 3-star as node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- (0, 2, 4, 6) is a potential 3-star as node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- (0, 2, 3, 6) is a potential 3-star as node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 6.
Therefore, a total of 4 3-stars are formed with the center node 0.

For the center node 1:
- (1, 5, 4, 6) is a potential 3-star as node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 4, and 6.
Therefore, only 1 3-star is formed with the center node 1.

For the center node 3:
- (3, 6, 0, 2) is a potential 3-star as node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 0, and 2.
Therefore, only 1 3-star is formed with the center node 3.

For the center node 5:
- (5, 1, 4, 6) is a potential 3-star as node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
Therefore, only 1 3-star is formed with the center node 5.

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (5, 4, 6)>, <3, (6, 0, 2)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>.
