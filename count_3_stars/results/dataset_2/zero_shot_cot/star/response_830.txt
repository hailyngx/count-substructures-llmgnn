Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 11) (7, 28) (7, 18) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 24) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 12) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 27) (6, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (28, 7) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 20) (19, 4) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 2) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 15) (26, 12) (9, 7) (9, 22) (9, 2) (9, 21) (22, 19) (22, 9) (22, 16) (22, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 15) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 13) (20, 27) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (21, 9) (21, 10) (21, 11) (21, 24) (25, 14) (25, 2) (11, 4) (11, 21) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 25) (13, 20) (13, 27) (15, 26) (15, 18) (3, 6) (3, 20) (3, 10) (24, 14) (24, 21) (23, 4) (23, 18) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 0) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 27) (12, 17) (12, 26) (12, 8) (27, 5) (27, 20) (27, 13) (27, 8) (0, 22) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify potential 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node and three other nodes connected to the central node.

Here are the nodes along with their connections:
- Node 0: {22, 1}
- Node 1: {16, 10, 0}
- Node 2: {19, 9, 25}
- Node 3: {6, 20, 10}
- Node 4: {19, 23, 11}
- Node 5: {6, 18, 27}
- Node 6: {14, 5, 3}
- Node 7: {28, 9, 18}
- Node 8: {10, 12, 27}
- Node 9: {7, 22, 2}
- Node 10: {21, 3, 8}
- Node 11: {4, 21}
- Node 12: {17, 26, 8}
- Node 13: {20, 27}
- Node 14: {17, 6, 24, 25}
- Node 15: {26, 18}
- Node 16: {22, 1}
- Node 17: {14, 12}
- Node 18: {5, 6, 28, 26, 23, 15}
- Node 19: {4, 2, 26}
- Node 20: {29, 3, 13, 27}
- Node 21: {10, 11, 24}
- Node 22: {9, 16, 0}
- Node 23: {4, 18}
- Node 24: {14, 21}
- Node 25: {14, 2}
- Node 26: {19, 15, 12}
- Node 27: {5, 13, 8}
- Node 28: {7, 29}
- Node 29: {28, 20}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

[The number of 3-stars in the graph is 7.]

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (22, 1, 16)>
<1, (0, 10, 16)>
<2, (9, 19, 25)>
<4, (11, 19, 23)>
<6, (5, 18, 27)>
<7, (9, 18, 28)>
<14, (17, 25, 6)>
