Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 10) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:

Node 0: 9, 4, 14, 11, 1, 13
Node 1: 6, 0, 10
Node 2: 5, 13, 3, 12, 7
Node 3: 14, 7, 2
Node 4: 8, 0
Node 5: 2, 8, 11
Node 6: 1, 14, 11
Node 7: 9, 3, 2, 10
Node 8: 5, 4, 10, 12
Node 9: 7, 13, 0, 12
Node 10: 8, 14, 13, 1, 7
Node 11: 5, 6, 0, 14
Node 12: 9, 8, 14, 2
Node 13: 9, 0, 2, 10
Node 14: 6, 0, 11, 3, 12, 10

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 4, 14)>
<0, (9, 11, 1)>
<0, (9, 13, 10)>
<0, (4, 8, 12)>
<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<0, (14, 11, 5)>
<0, (14, 12, 2)>
<0, (11, 6, 1)>
<0, (11, 14, 3)>
<2, (5, 8, 4)>
<2, (5, 13, 9)>
<2, (5, 12, 14)>
<2, (13, 9, 7)>
<2, (13, 7, 3)>
<2, (13, 10, 1)>
<2, (3, 7, 14)>
<5, (8, 4, 0)>
<5, (8, 10, 12)>
<9, (7, 3, 14)>
<10, (8, 12, 14)>
<13, (9, 0, 4)>
<13, (9, 10, 1)>
<14, (6, 11, 5)>
<14, (6, 1, 4)>
<14, (6, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
