Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 9) (2, 12) (2, 6) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (18, 10) (18, 12) (3, 6) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 3) (5, 14) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 15) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 4) (16, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars.
- Node 14 has connections with nodes 17, 9, 19, and 5.
- Node 17 has connections with nodes 14, 13, 11.
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 5, 16, 15.
- Node 7 and node 10 have 0 connections to other nodes so they cannot be central nodes.
- Node 11 has connections with nodes 17, 7, 5, 8.
- Node 13 has connections with nodes 17, 9, 0, 6.
- Node 8 has connections with nodes 10, 11, 19, 5.
- Node 19 has connections with nodes 14, 8, 1.
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 10, 13, 9.
- Node 2, node 12 and node 18 are connected together forming a cycle, they are not central nodes.
- Node 3 has connections with node 6 only.
- Node 1 has connections with nodes 19, 12, 16.

Next, let's find the leaves for each central node.
1. Central node 14: Leaves are 17, 9, 19, 5.
2. Central node 17: Leaves are 14, 13, 11.
3. Central node 4: Leaves are 5, 16, 15.
4. Central node 11: Leaves are 17, 7, 5, 8.
5. Central node 13: Leaves are 17, 9, 0, 6.
6. Central node 8: Leaves are 10, 11, 19, 5.
7. Central node 19: Leaves are 14, 8, 1.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
- <14, (17, 9, 19)>
- <14, (17, 9, 5)>
- <14, (17, 19, 5)>
- <14, (9, 19, 5)>
- <17, (14, 13, 11)>
- <4, (5, 16, 15)>
- <11, (17, 7, 5)>
- <11, (17, 5, 8)>
- <11, (7, 5, 8)>
- <13, (17, 9, 0)>
- <13, (17, 9, 6)>
- <8, (10, 11, 19)>
- <8, (10, 11, 5)>
- <8, (11, 19, 5)>
- <8, (10, 19, 5)>
- <19, (14, 8, 1)>

There are total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
