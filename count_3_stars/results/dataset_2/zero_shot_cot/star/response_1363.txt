Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the number of instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:

<3, (1, 6, 2)>
<5, (4, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 0)>
<9, (7, 6, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
