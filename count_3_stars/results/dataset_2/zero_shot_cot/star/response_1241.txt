Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 23) (15, 5) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (25, 26) (25, 23) (25, 28) (1, 28) (1, 23) (1, 0) (21, 0) (21, 26) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 18) (4, 15) (4, 22) (4, 24) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 14) (12, 7) (19, 17) (26, 25) (26, 21) (16, 7) (16, 28) (16, 9) (16, 10) (28, 25) (28, 1) (28, 16) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (2, 9) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 11) (22, 8) (22, 4) (22, 2) (22, 5) (22, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 5) (6, 18) (6, 27) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 20) (27, 6) (24, 4) (24, 22) (24, 20) (5, 15) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 29) (23, 3) (23, 14) (23, 25) (23, 1) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify these 3-stars:

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 21, 29)>
<1, (0, 23, 28)>
<2, (9, 11, 22)>
<4, (5, 15, 24)>
<5, (0, 22, 29)>
<7, (12, 16, 7)>
<8, (9, 13, 18)>
<13, (11, 14, 8)>
<14, (13, 17, 23)>
<15, (4, 5, 15)>
<16, (7, 9, 28)>
<17, (11, 14, 19)>
<18, (6, 13, 8)>
<20, (2, 10, 24)>
<22, (2, 4, 5)>
<23, (1, 14, 25)>
<24, (4, 20, 22)>
<25, (23, 26, 28)>
<26, (21, 25, 26)>
<28, (1, 16, 25)>
<29, (0, 5, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].
