Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 24) (0, 26) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 11) (12, 27) (12, 16) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 17) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 7) (9, 18) (9, 14) (9, 23) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 7) (3, 2) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 8) (21, 18) (10, 1) (10, 7) (15, 19) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (20, 21) (20, 8) (29, 23) (29, 14) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 19) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 16) (16, 12) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 8) (16, 5) (18, 9) (18, 21) (18, 6) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 25) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 26) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 6) (24, 0) (24, 25) (8, 1) (8, 21) (8, 20) (8, 16) (8, 6) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 24) (13, 14) (5, 22) (5, 16) (14, 9) (14, 29) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.

After examining the edges, we can identify the nodes that match this criterion: 0, 27, 12, 22, 26, 9, 1, 17, 3, 21, 10, 15, 11, 23, 20, 29, 28, 18, 4, 19, 6, 7, 24, 8, 25, 13, 5, 14

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by considering each potential center node:

- For node 0: <0, (27, 28, 24)>, <0, (27, 28, 26)>, <0, (27, 28, 2)>, <0, (27, 28, 26)>
- For node 27: <27, (0, 12, 11)>
- For node 12: <12, (27, 16, 11)>
- For node 22: <22, (4, 5, 17)>
- For node 26: <26, (0, 25, 7)>
- For node 9: <9, (1, 18, 14)>
- For node 1: <1, (17, 2, 10)>
- For node 17: <17, (22, 1, 19)>
- For node 3: No 3-star
- For node 21: <21, (16, 20, 8)>
- For node 10: No 3-star
- For node 15: No 3-star
- For node 11: <11, (27, 23, 4)>
- For node 23: <23, (9, 11, 29)>
- For node 20: No 3-star
- For node 29: <29, (23, 14, 4)>
- For node 28: <28, (0, 19, 25)>
- For node 18: No 3-star
- For node 4: <4, (22, 11, 29)>
- For node 19: <19, (17, 15, 28)>
- For node 6: No 3-star
- For node 7: <7, (17, 10, 6)>
- For node 24: <24, (0, 25, 2)>
- For node 8: <8, (16, 20, 6)>
- For node 25: <25, (26, 19, 24)>
- For node 13: No 3-star
- For node 5: <5, (22, 16, 7)>
- For node 14: <14, (9, 29, 13)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of 18 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
