Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (3, 2, 8)>
<9, (8, 2, 7)>
<1, (3, 0, 8)>
<3, (6, 1, 5)>
<4, (7, 5, 4)>
<7, (9, 8, 5)>
<0, (1, 3, 2)>
<2, (6, 9, 1)>
<8, (6, 9, 1)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
