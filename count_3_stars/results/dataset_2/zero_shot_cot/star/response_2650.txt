Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, we can identify the possible 3-star configurations in the graph. Since we have a total of 10 nodes, the possible central nodes for the 3-stars are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.

The possible 3-star configurations are as follows:
- Node 0: (0, 3, 7), (0, 7, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 3, 9), (1, 3, 5), (1, 5, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 5, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 9), (3, 1, 5), (3, 4, 6), (3, 6, 8), (3, 8, 7)
- Node 4: (4, 3, 6), (4, 5, 9)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 9), (5, 2, 6), (5, 4, 9)
- Node 6: (6, 3, 4), (6, 3, 8), (6, 4, 5), (6, 5, 2)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 9), (7, 3, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 2, 5), (8, 3, 6), (8, 3, 7), (8, 6, 5)
- Node 9: (9, 0, 7), (9, 0, 5), (9, 1, 3), (9, 1, 5), (9, 4, 5)

Counting the number of different 3-stars, we have a total of 19 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 9, 5)>
<2, (5, 8, 0)>
<3, (0, 9, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 9, 3)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 8, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 9)>
