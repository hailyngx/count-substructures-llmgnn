Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes that have degree 3, as they can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. These nodes are: 6, 9, 4, 8, 5, 0, 2, 7, 1, and 3.

Next, we check each of these nodes to see if they are indeed the center of a 3-star by verifying if they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 8) - forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 1, and 8 <6, (1, 8, 9)>
2. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 2) - forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 4, and 2 <9, (2, 4, 6)>
3. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 0) - forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 8, and 0 <4, (0, 8, 9)>
4. Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 3) - forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 4, and 3 <8, (3, 4, 6)>
5. Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 2), (5, 1) - forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 2, and 1 <5, (1, 2, 4)>
6. Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 3) - forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 5, and 3 <0, (3, 4, 5)>
7. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 5) - forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 4, and 5 <2, (4, 5, 9)>
8. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 1) - forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 8, and 1 <7, (1, 8, 9)>
9. Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 7) - forms a 3-star with leaves 6, 5, and 7 <1, (5, 6, 7)>
10. Node 3: (3, 8), (3, 0), (3, 2) - forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 0, and 2 <3, (0, 2, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <6, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, and <3, (0, 2, 8)>.
