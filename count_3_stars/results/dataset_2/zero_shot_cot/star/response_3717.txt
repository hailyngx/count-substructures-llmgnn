Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 8) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 13)>
<2, (4, 8, 14)>
<3, (5, 8, 12)>
<4, (0, 2, 13)>
<5, (3, 14, 3)>
<6, (0, 1, 10)>
<7, (1, 13, 14)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<9, (8, 12, 14)>
<10, (6, 11, 12)>
<11, (7, 10, 9)>
<12, (8, 10, 13)>
<13, (1, 4, 12)>
<14, (2, 5, 7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [14] 3-stars in the graph.
