Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 16) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (17, 15) (17, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 12) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 5) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 20) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 19) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 29) (4, 26) (8, 6) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 28) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 23) (0, 10) (28, 1) (28, 6) (28, 24) (28, 13) (24, 28) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 18) (26, 4) (26, 24) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 11) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 9) (25, 19) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 7) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 25) (19, 10) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 13) (2, 15) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 13) (20, 23) (20, 21) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 29) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 21) (16, 27) (16, 22) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 11, 19)>
<3, (1, 12, 21)>
<4, (22, 26, 29)>
<5, (6, 12, 22)>
<6, (5, 8, 28)>
<7, (9, 10, 29)>
<9, (4, 7, 24)>
<10, (0, 13, 19)>
<11, (1, 13, 21)>
<12, (3, 5, 21)>
<13, (10, 11, 28)>
<14, (0, 11, 15)>
<15, (14, 17, 27)>
<16, (22, 27, 29)>
<18, (19, 22, 26)>
<19, (1, 18, 25)>
<20, (21, 23, 28)>
<22, (4, 16, 18)>
<23, (0, 20, 22)>
<24, (9, 24, 26)>
<26, (18, 24, 4)>
<27, (15, 16, 22)>
<28, (1, 6, 13)>
<29, (4, 7, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
