Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 5) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 10) (2, 11) (2, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (0, 9) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 4) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which could be the center of a 3-star. 
1. Node 11 is connected to 5 other nodes: 16, 3, 9, 4, and 2.
2. Node 16 is connected to 3 other nodes: 11, 4, and 10.
3. Node 17 is connected to 3 other nodes: 9, 19, and 5.
4. Node 8 is connected to 4 other nodes: 13, 4, 6, and 18.
5. Node 13 is connected to 4 other nodes: 8, 19, 9, and 18.
6. Node 4 is connected to 4 other nodes: 11, 16, 8, and 10.
7. Node 18 is connected to 3 other nodes: 8, 13, and 15.
8. Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes: 17, 19, and 7.
9. Node 12 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 6, and 9.
10. Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 5, and 15.
11. Node 15 is connected to 3 other nodes: 18, 7, and 6.
12. Node 10 is connected to 3 other nodes: 16, 3, and 4.
13. Node 9 is connected to 5 other nodes: 11, 17, 11, 13, and 12.
14. Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes: 8, 12, and 15.

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:
<11, (16, 4, 2)>
<16, (11, 4, 10)>
<17, (9, 19, 5)>
<8, (13, 4, 18)>
<13, (8, 9, 18)>
<4, (11, 16, 10)>
<18, (8, 13, 15)>
<5, (17, 19, 7)>
<12, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 15)>
<15, (18, 7, 6)>
<10, (16, 3, 4)>
<9, (11, 17, 13)>
<6, (8, 12, 15)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
