Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (3, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

From the provided edge list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <0, (4, 10, 14)>
2. <1, (5, 6, 7)>
3. <2, (1, 7, 13)>
4. <4, (0, 7, 12)>
5. <6, (1, 5, 10)>
6. <7, (1, 4, 10)>
7. <10, (4, 6, 11)>
8. <11, (4, 10, 14)>
9. <12, (4, 8, 9)>
10. <13, (1, 2, 13)>
11. <14, (0, 6, 11)>

There are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is: [11].
