Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's examine the graph and identify the 3-stars present in it.

We can see that there are 10 nodes in total (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Now, we will go through each node to check for 3-stars.

1. For node 0, the edges are (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 3). So, node 0 is the center of the 3-star <0, (9, 6, 1)>.

2. For node 1, the edges are (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 0). So, node 1 is the center of the 3-star <1, (5, 4, 0)>.

3. For node 2, the edges are (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 8). So, node 2 is the center of the 3-star <2, (9, 4, 8)>.

4. For node 3, the edges are (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 4). So, node 3 is the center of the 3-star <3, (9, 6, 7)>.

5. For node 4, the edges are (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 2). So, node 4 is the center of the 3-star <4, (5, 6, 1)>.

6. For node 5, the edges are (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 7). So, node 5 is the center of the 3-star <5, (9, 1, 4)>.

7. For node 6, the edges are (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 0). So, node 6 is the center of the 3-star <6, (3, 4, 8)>.

8. For node 7, the edges are (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 4). So, node 7 is not the center of any 3-star.

9. For node 8, the edges are (8, 9), (8, 6), (8, 2). So, node 8 is the center of the 3-star <8, (9, 6, 2)>.

10. For node 9, the edges are (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 0). So, node 9 is the center of the 3-star <9, (5, 8, 2)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (9, 6, 1)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <2, (9, 4, 8)>, <3, (9, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 1, 4)>.
