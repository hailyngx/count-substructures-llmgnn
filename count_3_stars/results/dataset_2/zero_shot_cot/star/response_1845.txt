Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 8) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 4) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 2) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 17) (12, 7) (12, 5) (8, 3) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 17) (16, 7) (16, 19) (15, 0) (15, 13) (18, 0) (18, 5) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 4) (11, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 5) (2, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <6, (9, 4, 0)>
2. <9, (6, 13, 19)>
3. <1, (3, 4, 7)>
4. <3, (1, 10, 8)>
5. <14, (17, 2, 5)>
6. <17, (14, 10, 16)>
7. <10, (3, 17, 2)>
8. <7, (1, 12, 16)>
9. <12, (17, 7, 5)>
10. <8, (3, 19, 13)>
11. <19, (8, 13, 16)>
12. <0, (6, 19, 15)>
13. <16, (17, 7, 19)>
14. <15, (0, 13, 18)>
15. <18, (0, 5, 11)>
16. <5, (14, 12, 18)>
17. <11, (2, 18, 5)>

There are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
