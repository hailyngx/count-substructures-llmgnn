Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 17) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 18) (9, 2) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 2) (4, 6) (8, 18) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 2) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 5) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 7) (1, 10) (1, 17) (1, 7) (18, 9) (18, 8) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 1) (7, 2) (12, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first observe that a 3-star consists of a center node and three leaf nodes connected to the center node.

1. From the given edges, the possible center nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, and 19. 

2. We will list all unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (3, 6, 19)>
<1, (10, 17, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 17)>
<3, (11, 5, 12)>
<5, (2, 13, 19)>
<6, (0, 4, 13)>
<7, (1, 2, 19)>
<10, (1, 14, 17)>
<11, (3, 13, 6)>
<13, (5, 6, 14)>
<14, (10, 13, 19)>
<17, (1, 10, 2)>
<18, (8, 9, )
<19, (0, 7, 14)>

3. Counting the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get 14 3-stars.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
