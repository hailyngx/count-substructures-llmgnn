Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 4) (9, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 9) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars it contains.

First, we identify the central nodes in the graph. Central nodes are nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes.
4 nodes are connected to exactly 3 other nodes: nodes 10, 11, 13, and 14.

Next, we identify the leaves connected to each central node:
- Node 10: Leaves - 1, 4, 9
- Node 11: Leaves - 7, 13, 2
- Node 13: Leaves - 8, 4, 2
- Node 14: Leaves - 8, 0, 1

We can now count the number of unique 3-stars:
<10, (1, 4, 9)>
<11, (7, 13, 2)>
<13, (8, 4, 2)>
<14, (8, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
