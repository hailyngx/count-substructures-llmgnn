Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will act as the centers of the 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three edges connected to them: 

- Node 4 (3 edges)
- Node 8 (3 edges)
- Node 12 (4 edges)
- Node 1 (4 edges)
- Node 6 (4 edges)
- Node 2 (5 edges)
- Node 5 (4 edges)
- Node 3 (5 edges)
- Node 14 (4 edges)
- Node 9 (4 edges)
- Node 13 (5 edges)
- Node 0 (5 edges)

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

Unique 3-stars: 
<4, (5, 3, 7)>
<8, (10, 11, 7)>
<12, (7, 1, 0)>
<12, (7, 2, 5)>
<12, (7, 6, 14)>
<1, (12, 9, 6)>
<1, (12, 0, 5)>
<6, (7, 1, 14)>
<6, (7, 2, 13)>
