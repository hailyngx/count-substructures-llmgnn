Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 16) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 19) (18, 12) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 17) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 1) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 16) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 16) (2, 10) (2, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (15, 12) (15, 13) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

There are two 3-stars in this graph.
[2]

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (5, 6, 12)>
<12, (4, 15, 18)>
