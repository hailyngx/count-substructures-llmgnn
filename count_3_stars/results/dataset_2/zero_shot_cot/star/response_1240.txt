Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 20) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 15) (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 29) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 22) (8, 20) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 25) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (2, 12) (18, 8) (18, 20) (6, 21) (6, 23) (21, 9) (21, 6) (29, 16) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 19) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 25) (23, 6) (23, 4) (23, 25) (23, 0) (25, 13) (25, 19) (25, 23) (27, 5) (0, 10) (0, 23) (0, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 5) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 20) (7, 14) (7, 24) (7, 28) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 3) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (4, 23) (4, 28) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 28) (28, 14) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 4) (28, 22) (5, 27) (5, 15) (5, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. 

Let's go through each node and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 1: (1, 8, 13), (1, 14, 7), <1, 13, 8>, <1, 14, 7>
- Node 2: No 3-star
- Node 3: (3, 17, 0), <3, 17, 0>, <3, 20, 17>
- Node 4: No 3-star
- Node 5: (5, 15, 27), (5, 24, 27), <5, 15, 24>, <5, 27, 15>
- Node 6: No 3-star
- Node 7: (7, 14, 24), (7, 1, 14), (7, 28, 24), <7, 1, 14>, <7, 14, 24>, <7, 24, 28>
- Node 8: (8, 1, 13), (8, 18, 20), (8, 20, 11), <8, 1, 13>, <8, 11, 20>, <8, 18, 20>
- Node 9: (9, 26, 21), (9, 26, 29), (9, 21, 6), <9, 21, 6>, <9, 26, 29>, <9, 21, 26>
- Node 10: (10, 26, 12), (10, 26, 17), (10, 0, 12), <10, 12, 26>, <10, 17, 26>, <10, 12, 0>
- Node 11: (11, 20, 8)
- Node 12: (12, 10, 2), <12, 10, 2>
- Node 13: (13, 25, 1)
- Node 14: (14, 26, 17), (14, 1, 7), (14, 7, 24), <14, 26, 17>, <14, 1, 7>, <14, 7, 24>, <14, 17, 26>
- Node 15: (15, 16, 19), (15, 19, 25), (15, 5, 24), <15, 16, 19>, <15, 19, 25>, <15, 5, 24>
- Node 16: (16, 15, 29), (16, 22, 17), (16, 29, 19), <16, 15, 29>, <16, 17, 22>, <16, 19, 29>
- Node 17: (17, 14, 10), (17, 3, 0), (17, 22, 28), <17, 14, 10>, <17, 3, 0>, <17, 22, 28>
- Node 18: (18, 20, 8)
- Node 19: (19, 15, 25)
- Node 20: (20, 8, 11)
- Node 21: (21, 9, 6)
- Node 22: (22, 17, 28)
- Node 23: (23, 6, 4), (23, 25, 0), (23, 0, 4), <23, 6, 4>, <23, 0, 25>, <23, 4, 28>
- Node 24: (24, 7, 14), (24, 5, 27), (24, 28, 4), <24, 7, 14>, <24, 5, 27>, <24, 4, 28>
- Node 25: (25, 19, 15), (25, 23, 0), (25, 13, 1), <25, 15, 19>, <25, 0, 23>, <25, 13, 1>
- Node 26: (26, 9, 21), (26, 14, 17), (26, 10, 29), <26, 9, 21>, <26, 14, 17>, <26, 10, 29>
- Node 27: (27, 5, 15)
- Node 28: (28, 7, 24), (28, 4, 22), (28, 22, 17), <28, 7, 24>, <28, 4, 22>, <28, 17, 22>
- Node 29: (29, 16, 19), (29, 26, 9), (29, 19, 15), <29, 19, 15>, <29, 9, 26>, <29, 15, 16>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of 34.
Therefore, the answer is [34].
