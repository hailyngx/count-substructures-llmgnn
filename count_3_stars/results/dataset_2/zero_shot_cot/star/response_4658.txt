Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 24) (22, 13) (22, 10) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 21) (9, 6) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 28) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 29) (8, 27) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 14) (28, 6) (28, 4) (28, 3) (28, 14) (26, 13) (26, 23) (26, 14) (27, 4) (27, 8) (27, 3) (27, 20) (1, 7) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 19) (15, 23) (15, 1) (21, 6) (21, 19) (21, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (10, 22) (10, 5) (14, 23) (14, 28) (14, 26) (14, 12) (3, 28) (3, 27) (3, 19) (3, 5) (24, 13) (24, 1) (24, 5) (24, 25) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 20) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 3) (5, 24) (5, 2) (0, 17) (0, 12) (29, 13) (29, 8) (20, 27) (20, 16) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 17) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 12) (25, 24) (19, 1) (19, 21) (19, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3 (potential centers of 3-stars):
   - Node 13 has degree 5.
   - Node 22 has degree 2.
   - Node 6 has degree 3.
   - Node 9 has degree 2.
   - Node 4 has degree 4.
   - Node 7 has degree 2.
   - Node 8 has degree 3.
   - Node 23 has degree 3.
   - Node 28 has degree 4.
   - Node 26 has degree 3.
   - Node 27 has degree 4.
   - Node 1 has degree 4.
   - Node 15 has degree 2.
   - Node 21 has degree 3.
   - Node 14 has degree 4.
   - Node 3 has degree 4.
   - Node 24 has degree 4.
   - Node 16 has degree 4.
   - Node 2 has degree 3.
   - Node 5 has degree 4.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - Node 6: (6, 9, 28), (6, 21, 19)
   - Node 4: (4, 7, 1), (4, 27, 3), (4, 16, 2)
   - Node 8: (8, 13, 22)
   - Node 23: (23, 26, 14), (23, 15, 1)

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: 4

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (9, 28, 21)>, <4, (7, 1, 27)>, <8, (13, 22)>, <23, (26, 14, 15)>.
