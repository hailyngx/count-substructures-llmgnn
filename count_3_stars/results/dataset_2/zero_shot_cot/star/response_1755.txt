Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8. <0, (1, 4, 8)>
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7. <2, (0, 4, 7)>
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7. <3, (1, 5, 7)>
4. Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 8. <5, (2, 3, 8)>
5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 3. <7, (1, 2, 3)>
6. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6. <9, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
