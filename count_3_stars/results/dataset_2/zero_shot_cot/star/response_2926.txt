Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 22) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 23) (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 14) (22, 26) (22, 13) (22, 28) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 1) (21, 17) (10, 24) (11, 19) (11, 17) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 16) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 6) (23, 27) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 17) (5, 23) (5, 3) (28, 27) (28, 22) (28, 16) (28, 19) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 0) (1, 21) (17, 21) (17, 11) (17, 23) (17, 24) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 29) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 12) (16, 3) (16, 2) (20, 29) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 28) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 13) (12, 16) (12, 19) (12, 3) (24, 7) (24, 10) (24, 8) (24, 17) (25, 15) (25, 13) (3, 5) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 6) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 16) (2, 6) (14, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. Since each central node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we will look for nodes with exactly 3 incident edges.

The nodes with exactly 3 incident edges are: 
- Node 15
- Node 1
- Node 5
- Node 11
- Node 20

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node to form a 3-star. We will then determine the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.

For Node 15: (Center: 15, Leaves: 0, 18, 25)
For Node 1: (Center: 1, Leaves: 21, 17, 7)
For Node 5: (Center: 5, Leaves: 23, 3, 6)
For Node 11: (Center: 11, Leaves: 19, 17, 12)
For Node 20: (Center: 20, Leaves: 29, 0, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
The unique 3-stars found are: <15, (0, 18, 25)>, <1, (21, 17, 7)>, <5, (23, 3, 6)>, <11, (19, 17, 12)>, <20, (29, 0, 6)>.
