Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. 

After checking all the edges, we can determine that the possible central nodes for the 3-stars are nodes 5, 9, 4, and 14. 

Now, let's list down the 3-stars:

<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 2, 11)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 14)>
<6, (1, 10, 0)>
<2, (9, 8, 10)>
<8, (1, 2, 10)>
<12, (7, 8, 10)>
<0, (7, 3, 6)>
<14, (5, 7, 13)>
<13, (3, 14, 11)>
<10, (6, 2, 8)>
<11, (9, 8, 13)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars listed above, we find a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
