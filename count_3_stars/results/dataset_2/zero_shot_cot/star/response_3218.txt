Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars based on the given edges:
1. Node 0: (4, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (2, 0)
2. Node 1: (4, 1), (7, 1), (5, 1), (2, 1), (1, 14)
3. Node 2: (4, 2), (5, 2), (2, 1), (2, 14), (0, 2)
4. Node 3: (4, 3), (5, 3), (13, 3)
5. Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 11), (4, 3)
6. Node 5: (5, 11), (5, 13), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 3)
7. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 0)
8. Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 11), (7, 14), (7, 8), (7, 1)
9. Node 8: (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 9), (8, 10), (8, 11)
10. Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 14)
11. Node 10: (10, 8), (10, 13)
12. Node 11: (11, 4), (11, 7), (11, 5), (11, 8), (11, 12)
13. Node 12: (12, 11), (12, 14)
14. Node 13: (13, 10), (13, 5), (13, 3)
15. Node 14: (14, 7), (14, 9), (14, 2), (14, 1), (14, 12)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
From the above list, we observe that the following nodes can be central nodes of a 3-star:
- Node 4: (4, 0, 1), (4, 11, 3)
- Node 5: (5, 11, 13)
- Node 7: (7, 0, 11), (7, 14, 8), (7, 1, 4)
- Node 8: (8, 6, 9), (8, 10, 13), (8, 7, 11)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7]. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
<4, (0, 1, 11)>
<5, (11, 13, 5)>
<7, (0, 4, 11)>
<7, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (8, 14, 7)>
<8, (6, 9, 8)>
<8, (10, 13, 8)>
