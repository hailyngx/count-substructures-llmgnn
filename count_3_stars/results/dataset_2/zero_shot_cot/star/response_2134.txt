Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 2) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[4]

<1, (3, 5, 14)>
<3, (1, 4, 11)>
<4, (3, 11, 13)>
<11, (3, 4, 12)>
