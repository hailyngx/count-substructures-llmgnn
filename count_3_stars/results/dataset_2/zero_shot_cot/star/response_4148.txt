Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Let's list down all the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 7, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
