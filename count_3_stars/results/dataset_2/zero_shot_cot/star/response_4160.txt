Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 4) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 4) (15, 2) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 14) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 12) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 4) (17, 16) (17, 7) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 7) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 5) (1, 10) (1, 18) (18, 5) (18, 1) (18, 7) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 18) (4, 16) (4, 15) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <11, (16, 5, 15)>
2. <16, (11, 17, 3)>
3. <3, (16, 15, 10)>
4. <15, (11, 3, 19)>
5. <8, (9, 12, 0)>
6. <13, (2, 14, 4)>
7. <9, (8, 0, 10)>
8. <0, (9, 10, 6)>
9. <10, (3, 0, 1)>
10. <19, (3, 15, 6)>
11. <6, (0, 19, 14)>
12. <14, (13, 4, 6)>
13. <17, (16, 7, -)>
14. <2, (15, 13, 7)>
15. <5, (11, 12, 18)>
16. <12, (8, 19, 5)>
17. <1, (10, 18, -)>
18. <18, (5, 1, 7)>
19. <7, (17, 2, 18)>
20. <4, (16, 15, 14)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph: [20]
