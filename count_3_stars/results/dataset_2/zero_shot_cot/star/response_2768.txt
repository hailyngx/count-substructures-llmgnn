Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (5, 3) (5, 18) (6, 17) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 18) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 4) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (18, 5) (18, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 16) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 19) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern consisting of a center node and three leaf nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. From the given edges, we can identify certain 3-star patterns:
- <3, (2, 5, 10)>
- <10, (3, 11, 15)>
- <14, (4, 7, 17)>
- <17, (6, 14, 19)>
- <11, (9, 10, 14)>
- <5, (3, 18, -)>
- <2, (3, 7, -)>
- <8, (7, 12, 14)>
- <13, (1, 9, 10)>
- <0, (7, 16, 19)>
- <1, (4, 13, 15)>
- <16, (0, 9, 4)>
- <12, (0, 8, -)>
- <18, (5, 7, -)>

2. Counting the unique 3-stars found:
- <3, (2, 5, 10)>
- <10, (3, 11, 15)>
- <14, (4, 7, 17)>
- <17, (6, 14, 19)>
- <11, (9, 10, 14)>
- <5, (3, 18, -)>
- <2, (3, 7, -)>
- <8, (7, 12, 14)>
- <13, (1, 9, 10)>
- <0, (7, 16, 19)>
- <1, (4, 13, 15)>
- <16, (0, 9, 4)>
- <12, (0, 8, -)>
- <18, (5, 7, -)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
