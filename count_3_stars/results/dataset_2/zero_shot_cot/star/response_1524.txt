Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 10) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list the connections of each node:
- Node 0 is connected to: 10, 8, 2
- Node 1 is connected to: 9, 3, 14, 12
- Node 2 is connected to: 9, 0, 14, 13
- Node 3 is connected to: 1, 14, 6, 8, 13
- Node 4 is connected to: 9, 7, 11
- Node 5 is connected to: 9, 6, 8, 12, 10
- Node 6 is connected to: 5, 3, 11
- Node 7 is connected to: 4, 12, 11, 10
- Node 8 is connected to: 5, 3, 0, 10
- Node 9 is connected to: 5, 4, 2, 14, 1, 12
- Node 10 is connected to: 5, 7, 0, 8
- Node 11 is connected to: 4, 7, 6, 14
- Node 12 is connected to: 5, 9, 7, 1
- Node 13 is connected to: 3, 2
- Node 14 is connected to: 9, 1, 3, 11, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (10, 8, 2)>
- <1, (9, 3, 14)>
- <2, (9, 0, 14)>
- <3, (1, 14, 6)>
- <4, (9, 7, 11)>
- <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- <6, (5, 3, 11)>
- <7, (9, 12, 4)>
- <8, (5, 0, 10)>
- <9, (5, 1, 12)>
- <10, (0, 7, 8)>
- <11, (7, 6, 14)>
- <12, (5, 7, 9)>
- <13, (3, 2, 13)>
- <14, (9, 11, 1)>

Finally, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph: [14].
