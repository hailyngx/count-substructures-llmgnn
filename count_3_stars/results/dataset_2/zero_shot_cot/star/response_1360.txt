Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 16) (6, 19) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 5) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 5) (14, 10) (14, 15) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 15) (1, 2) (1, 11) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 19) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 16) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 8) (15, 14) (15, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node of a 3-star. Since each 3-star has exactly 3 leaves connected to the center, we need to find nodes with degree 3 in the graph.

From the given edges, the nodes with degree 3 (leaves of potential 3-stars) are:
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 19, 13, and 6)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 4, 3, and 16)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 8, 17, and 13)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 8, 12, and 14)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 17, 18, and 1)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 10, 5, and 11)
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 2, 16, and 5)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 18, 12, and 0)
- Node 19 (connected to nodes 4, 6, and 5)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 9, 10, and 16)
- Node 16 (connected to nodes 6, 0, and 8)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 14, 11, and 15)
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 4, 7, and 9)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 6, 11, and 13)
- Node 11 (connected to nodes 12, 3, and 1)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 2, 11, and 15)
- Node 18 (connected to nodes 2, 5, and 19)
- Node 17 (connected to nodes 9, 2, and 2)

Now, let's form the 3-stars:
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaves 19, 13, and 6: <4, (19, 13, 6)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 3, and 16: <6, (4, 3, 16)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 17, and 13: <9, (8, 17, 13)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with leaves 8, 12, and 14: <10, (8, 12, 14)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with leaves 10, 5, and 11: <12, (10, 5, 11)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 16, and 5: <0, (2, 16, 5)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaves 18, 12, and 0: <5, (18, 12, 0)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with leaves 4, 6, and 5: <19, (4, 6, 5)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 10, and 16: <8, (9, 10, 16)>
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with leaves 12, 3, and 1: <11, (12, 3, 1)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with leaves 9, 2, and 2: <17, (9, 2, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
