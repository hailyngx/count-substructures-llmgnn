Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Given the graph information, the number of 3-star structures can be calculated based on the connectivity of nodes. 

Additionally, it can be observed that there are multiple 3-star structures in the graph, each with a different central node and three leaves. By examining the provided edge information, we can identify the unique 3-star structures that exist in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (8, 1, 5)>
<6, (8, 4, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star structures in the given graph is [10].
