Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 14) (4, 13) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 16) (12, 15) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 7) (18, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (14, 16) (14, 10) (14, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, which are the potential central nodes of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has neighbors: 16, 7, 6, 2
- Node 2 has neighbors: 17, 0, 1, 9, 13
- Node 5 has neighbors: 6, 19, 18
- Node 6 has neighbors: 5, 19, 0
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 18, 1
- Node 8 has neighbors: 10, 17, 9
- Node 9 has neighbors: 11, 8, 2
- Node 10 has neighbors: 17, 15, 8, 14
- Node 14 has neighbors: 16, 10, 19
- Node 15 has neighbors: 11, 12, 10

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- From node 0: <0, (16, 7, 6)>, <0, (16, 2, 1)>, <0, (6, 5, 19)>
- From node 2: <2, (17, 0, 1)>, <2, (17, 9, 13)>, <2, (0, 6, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- From node 5: <5, (6, 19, 18)>, <5, (6, 0, 16)>
- From node 6: <6, (5, 19, 18)>, <6, (5, 19, 3)>, <6, (19, 0, 7)>
- From node 7: <7, (0, 16, 2)>, <7, (0, 2, 1)>, <7, (18, 5, 6)>
- From node 8: <8, (10, 17, 9)>
- From node 9: <9, (11, 8, 2)>
- From node 10: <10, (17, 8, 9)>
- From node 14: <14, (16, 10, 19)>, <14, (10, 17, 8)>, <14, (19, 5, 6)>
- From node 15: <15, (11, 12, 10)>

Total number of 3-stars: [14]
