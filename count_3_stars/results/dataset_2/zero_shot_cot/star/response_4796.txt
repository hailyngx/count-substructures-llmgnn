Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Identify nodes that are central nodes in 3-stars:
- 4 is connected to 3, 29, 2
- 7 is connected to 24, 19
- 18 is connected to 23, 0
- 22 is connected to 10
- 1 is connected to 11, 16, 24
- 3 is connected to 4, 19, 26, 5
- 20 is connected to 13, 28
- 25 is connected to 27, 28, 11
- 10 is connected to 22, 12, 16
- 17 is connected to 9, 24, 8
- 15 is connected to 26, 0, 16
- 2 is connected to 4, 8, 23, 13
- 8 is connected to 17, 2
- 26 is connected to 3, 15
- 21 is connected to 28, 29
- 28 is connected to 20, 25, 21, 12
- 5 is connected to 3, 13
- 13 is connected to 20, 2, 5, 19, 23
- 27 is connected to 25, 6
- 11 is connected to 1, 25, 9
- 16 is connected to 1, 10, 15, 24, 23
- 24 is connected to 7, 1, 17, 16
- 29 is connected to 4, 21, 6
- 23 is connected to 18, 2, 13, 16, 9
- 6 is connected to 27, 29
- 0 is connected to 18, 15, 19
- 9 is connected to 17, 11, 23, 12
- 12 is connected to 10, 28, 9, 19
- 19 is connected to 7, 3, 13, 0, 12

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars:
- 4: 1
- 7: 1
- 18: 1
- 22: 1
- 1: 1
- 3: 1
- 20: 1
- 25: 1
- 10: 1
- 17: 1
- 15: 1
- 2: 1
- 8: 1
- 26: 1
- 21: 1
- 28: 1
- 5: 1
- 13: 1
- 27: 1
- 11: 1
- 16: 1
- 24: 1
- 29: 1
- 23: 1
- 6: 1
- 0: 1
- 9: 1
- 12: 1
- 19: 1

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars: 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are: <4, (3, 29, 2)>, <7, (24, 19)>, <18, (23, 0)>, <22, (10)>, <1, (11, 16, 24)>, <3, (4, 19, 26)>, <20, (13, 28)>, <25, (27, 28, 11)>, <10, (22, 12, 16)>, <17, (9, 24, 8)>, <15, (26, 0, 16)>, <2, (4, 8, 23, 13)>, <8, (17, 2)>, <26, (3, 15)>, <21, (28, 29)>, <28, (20, 25, 21, 12)>, <5, (3, 13)>, <13, (20, 2, 5, 19, 23)>, <27, (25, 6)>, <11, (1, 25, 9)>, <16, (1, 10, 15, 24, 23)>, <24, (7, 1, 17, 16)>, <29, (4, 21, 6)>, <23, (18, 2, 13, 16, 9)>, <6, (27, 29)>, <0, (18, 15, 19)>, <9, (17, 11, 23, 12)>, <12, (10, 28, 9, 19)>, <19, (7, 3, 13, 0, 12)>
