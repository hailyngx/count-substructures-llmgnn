Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 23) (1, 19) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 1) (6, 28) (6, 0) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 24) (28, 18) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 2) (14, 23) (22, 26) (22, 27) (22, 5) (26, 22) (26, 15) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 20) (17, 11) (17, 2) (29, 21) (7, 3) (7, 25) (7, 20) (7, 18) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 8) (16, 28) (16, 0) (10, 9) (10, 5) (21, 29) (21, 18) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 8) (12, 23) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 25) (15, 26) (19, 1) (19, 13) (20, 11) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 13) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 20) (13, 9) (13, 24) (8, 25) (8, 12) (8, 20) (23, 1) (23, 14) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 4) (18, 28) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 24) (24, 28) (24, 13) (24, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (3, 6, 19)>
<3, (1, 7, 0)>
<6, (1, 28, 0)>
<28, (6, 16, 24)>
<0, (3, 6, 16)>
<22, (26, 27, 5)>
<26, (22, 15, 5)>
<11, (9, 17, 20)>
<17, (11, 2, 7)>
<29, (21, 18, 0)>
<7, (3, 25, 20)>
<25, (7, 27, 13)>
<16, (28, 0, 18)>
<10, (9, 5, 0)>
<21, (29, 18, 0)>
<2, (0, 17, 9)>
<4, (12, 5, 0)>
<12, (4, 20, 8)>
<15, (26, 1, 20)>
<19, (1, 13, 0)>
<20, (11, 7, 12)>
<9, (11, 10, 2)>
<13, (25, 19, 20)>
<8, (12, 25, 20)>
<23, (1, 14, 12)>
<5, (22, 10, 4)>
<18, (28, 7, 21)>
<24, (28, 13, 18)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
[29]
