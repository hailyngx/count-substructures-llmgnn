Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 5) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 4) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Nodes with degree 3 will be the centers of the 3-stars. From the given graph, nodes with degree 3 are: 6, 7, 12, 13.

2. For each of these nodes, identify the neighbors that form the edges of the 3-stars:
   - For node 6: (6, 9, 1), (6, 7, 10), (6, 13, 7)
   - For node 7: (7, 6, 11), (7, 12, 2), (7, 13, 5)
   - For node 12: (12, 7, 4), (12, 2, 4)
   - For node 13: (13, 6, 5), (13, 7, 13), (13, 4, 2)

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
   <6, (9, 1, 7)>, <6, (7, 10, 13)>, <7, (6, 11, 5)>, <7, (12, 2, 4)>, <13, (6, 5, 13)>, <13, (7, 13, 4)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [6]
