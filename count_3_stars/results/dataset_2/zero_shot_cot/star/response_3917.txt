Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (9, 8, 1)>
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
<5, (6, 8, 1)>
<2, (4, 8, 7)>
<0, (6, 5, 2)>
<7, (6, 5, 2)>
<3, (6, 2, 0)>
<1, (4, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10]. 
The unique 3-stars present in the graph are <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <4, (9, 8, 1)>, <8, (9, 4, 5)>, <5, (6, 8, 1)>, <2, (4, 8, 7)>, <0, (6, 5, 2)>, <7, (6, 5, 2)>, <3, (6, 2, 0)>, <1, (4, 5, 0)>.
