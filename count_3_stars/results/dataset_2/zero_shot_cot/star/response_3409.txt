Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 15) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 19) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 18) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 10) (15, 16) (15, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 4) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 10) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 19) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 18) (18, 13) (18, 10) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph:

<11, (16, 7, 9)>
<16, (11, 15, 6)>
<6, (1, 14, 10)>
<9, (11, 8, 4)>
<8, (9, 13, 19)>
<13, (11, 8, 2)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<7, (11, 2, 17)>
<1, (6, 15, 10)>
<15, (16, 1, 5)>
<4, (9, 0, 12)>
<12, (4, None, None)>
<2, (13, 7, 4)>
<3, (0, 14, None)>
<5, (0, 17, 10)>
<14, (6, 3, 19)>
<17, (11, 7, 5)>
<10, (6, 1, 5)>
<18, (10, 13, None)>
<19, (9, 13, 14)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [19].
