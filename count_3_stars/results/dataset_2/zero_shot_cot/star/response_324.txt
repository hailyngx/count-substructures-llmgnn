Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 19) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (2, 13) (18, 10) (18, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (8, 11) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 7) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 18) (12, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 9) (4, 13) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1: (15, 8, 1)
- Node 3: (15, 7, 3)
- Node 4: (9, 13, 4)
- Node 5: (0, 13, 5)
- Node 6: (16, 12, 6)
- Node 7: (19, 7, 3)
- Node 8: (8, 15, 0)
- Node 9: (16, 9, 4)
- Node 10: (17, 10, 6)
- Node 11: (16, 8, 11)
- Node 12: (15, 18, 12)
- Node 13: (9, 13, 2)
- Node 14: (17, 19, 14)
- Node 15: (12, 16, 15)
- Node 16: (11, 12, 16)
- Node 17: (14, 10, 17)
- Node 18: (10, 12, 18)
- Node 19: (17, 7, 19)

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
