Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 28) (11, 10) (21, 5) (21, 18) (28, 10) (28, 8) (28, 5) (19, 10) (19, 26) (19, 17) (26, 10) (26, 19) (26, 8) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 0) (24, 2) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 25) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 19) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 18) (5, 21) (5, 28) (5, 29) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 9) (6, 24) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 18) (4, 23) (4, 3) (4, 16) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 14) (8, 25) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 20) (16, 4) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 15) (14, 8) (14, 18) (2, 24) (2, 1) (20, 12) (20, 27) (25, 1) (25, 8) (27, 24) (27, 20) (27, 3) (27, 9) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 16) (18, 21) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 14) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 27) (15, 16) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 27) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Central Node: 10
   Leaves: 11, 26, 19
   <10, (11, 26, 19)>

2. Central Node: 10
   Leaves: 7, 28, 19
   <10, (7, 28, 19)>

3. Central Node: 10
   Leaves: 7, 26, 28
   <10, (7, 28, 26)>

4. Central Node: 10
   Leaves: 7, 28, 26
   <10, (7, 28, 26)>

5. Central Node: 19
   Leaves: 10, 17, 26
   <19, (10, 17, 26)>

6. Central Node: 19
   Leaves: 10, 17, 7
   <19, (10, 7, 17)>

7. Central Node: 19
   Leaves: 10, 26, 17
   <19, (10, 17, 26)>
