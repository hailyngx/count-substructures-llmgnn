Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node to see if any of them form a 3-star.

Node 0: {7, 1}
Node 1: {7, 3, 6, 2, 5, 0}
Node 2: {1, 3, 5, 8}
Node 3: {4, 1, 9, 2, 5}
Node 4: {9, 5, 6, 3}
Node 5: {4, 1, 3, 6, 2, 8}
Node 6: {4, 1, 5}
Node 7: {0, 8, 1}
Node 8: {7, 9, 5, 2}
Node 9: {4, 3, 8}

Now, let's see which nodes can be a central node of a 3-star:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
- The rest of the nodes have less than 4 neighbors, so they cannot be central nodes of a 3-star.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: There are 6 possible 3-stars. <1, (7, 3, 6)>, <1, (7, 3, 2)>, <1, (7, 3, 5)>, <1, (7, 3, 0)>, <1, (3, 6, 5)>, and <1, (3, 6, 0)>.
- For node 3: There are 5 possible 3-stars. <3, (4, 9, 5)>, <3, (4, 9, 2)>, <3, (4, 9, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 2)>, and <3, (4, 5, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11]. 
The unique 3-stars are <1, (7, 3, 6)>, <1, (7, 3, 2)>, <1, (7, 3, 5)>, <1, (7, 3, 0)>, <1, (3, 6, 5)>, <1, (3, 6, 0)>, <3, (4, 9, 5)>, <3, (4, 9, 2)>, <3, (4, 9, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 2)>, and <3, (4, 5, 8>.
