Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 5: (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 26)
   <5, (3, 19, 26)>

2. Node 7: (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 20)
   <7, (1, 16, 20)>

3. Node 13: (13, 2) (13, 17) (13, 27)
   <13, (2, 17, 27)>

4. Node 14: (14, 16) (14, 21) (14, 26)
   <14, (16, 21, 26)>

5. Node 19: (19, 5) (19, 24) (19, 27)
   <19, (5, 24, 27)>

6. Node 26: (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 10)
   <26, (5, 6, 10)>

7. Node 9: (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 29)
   <9, (15, 19, 29)>

8. Node 27: (27, 13) (27, 8) (27, 19)
   <27, (13, 8, 19)>

9. Node 3: (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 19)
   <3, (5, 11, 19)>

10. Node 18: (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 20)
   <18, (4, 10, 20)>

11. Node 17: (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15)
   <17, (7, 13, 15)>

12. Node 2: (2, 13) (2, 22) (2, 28)
   <2, (13, 22, 28)>

13. Node 1: (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 29)
   <1, (7, 0, 29)>

14. Node 16: (16, 5) (16, 7) (16, 14)
   <16, (5, 7, 14)>

15. Node 21: (21, 5) (21, 14) (21, 20)
   <21, (5, 14, 20)>

16. Node 29: (29, 1) (29, 8) (29, 9)
   <29, (1, 8, 9)>

17. Node 12: (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 23)
   <12, (18, 13, 23)>

18. Node 22: (22, 2) (22, 16) (22, 25)
   <22, (2, 16, 25)>

19. Node 8: (8, 21) (8, 27) (8, 29)
   <8, (21, 27, 29)>

20. Node 20: (20, 7) (20, 18) (20, 21)
   <20, (7, 18, 21)>

21. Node 15: (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 28)
   <15, (9, 17, 28)>

   No other edges connected to Node 6.

23. Node 24: (24, 19)
   No other edges connected to Node 24.

25. Node 25: (25, 2)
   No other edges connected to Node 25.

26. Node 0: (0, 1)
   No other edges connected to Node 0.

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [26]
