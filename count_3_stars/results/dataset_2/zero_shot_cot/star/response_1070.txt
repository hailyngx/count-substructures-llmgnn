Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 15) (7, 3) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 15) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (0, 8) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 19) (17, 8) (17, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 15) (10, 16) (10, 14) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 19) (11, 13) (11, 17) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 7) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars.

1. Find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2: (2, 18), (2, 13), (2, 16), (2, 10), (2, 14) (Degree: 5)
- Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 17), (8, 0) (Degree: 4)
- Node 10: (10, 2), (10, 4), (10, 15), (10, 16), (10, 14) (Degree: 5)
- Node 11: (11, 13), (11, 17), (11, 15), (11, 19) (Degree: 4)
- Node 13: (13, 9), (13, 2), (13, 11), (13, 19) (Degree: 4)
- Node 15: (15, 18), (15, 12), (15, 10), (15, 19), (15, 11) (Degree: 5)
- Node 16: (16, 2), (16, 7), (16, 10), (16, 19) (Degree: 4)
- Node 19: (19, 13), (19, 15), (19, 11), (19, 16) (Degree: 4)

2. Count the number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 2: <2, (18, 15, 19)>, <2, (16, 7, 5)>, <2, (10, 4, 8)>, <2, (14, 6, 3)>, <2, (13, 2, 16)>, <2, (13, 9, 8)>, <2, (13, 11, 19)>
- Node 8: <8, (9, 1, 13)>, <8, (4, 10, 2)>, <8, (17, 11, 19)>, <8, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 10: <10, (2, 18, 15)>, <10, (4, 8, 17)>, <10, (15, 19, 11)>, <10, (16, 7, 3)>, <10, (14, 2, 13)>
- Node 11: <11, (13, 9, 19)>, <11, (17, 8, 0)>, <11, (15, 10, 16)>, <11, (19, 15, 12)>
- Node 13: <13, (9, 1, 19)>, <13, (2, 18, 15)>, <13, (11, 17, 8)>, <13, (19, 15, 12)>
- Node 15: <15, (18, 2, 13)>, <15, (12, 5, 7)>, <15, (10, 16, 19)>, <15, (19, 11, 17)>, <15, (11, 13, 19)>
- Node 16: <16, (2, 10, 4)>, <16, (7, 5, 12)>, <16, (10, 15, 19)>, <16, (19, 11, 17)>
- Node 19: <19, (13, 9, 1)>, <19, (15, 18, 2)>, <19, (11, 17, 8)>, <19, (16, 10, 14)>

[Count: 28]
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
