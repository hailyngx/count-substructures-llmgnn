Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 15) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (4, 19) (8, 3) (8, 19) (17, 6) (17, 2) (9, 19) (9, 0) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 12) (2, 17) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 13) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 14) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 15) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 6) (13, 18) (13, 15) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph can be found by identifying nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges. We will then check if these nodes form a 3-star structure. 

By checking the given edges and incident nodes, the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (3, 7, 11)>
<3, (0, 12, 14)>
<6, (7, 10, 17)>
<15, (5, 11, 16)>
<18, (10, 11, 13)>
