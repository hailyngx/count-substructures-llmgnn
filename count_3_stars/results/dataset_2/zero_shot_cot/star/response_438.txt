Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes directly.

Given the edge list, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <6, (9, 5, 3)>
2. <9, (6, 4, 2)>
3. <4, (9, 7, 8)>
4. <7, (4, 8, 5)>
5. <8, (4, 7, 0)>
6. <5, (6, 7, 8)>
7. <1, (4, 2, 0)>
8. <3, (6, 4, 0)>
9. <0, (8, 5, 1)>
10. <2, (6, 9, 1)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the answer is [10].
