Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 11) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can analyze each node and its neighbors to see if they form a 3-star. 

Looking at the edges provided, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 5: <5, (9, 12, 13)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 8, 4)>
- Node 4: <4, (9, 12, 14)>
- Node 7: No 3-stars as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 8: <8, (9, 13, 2)>
- Node 13: <13, (5, 8, 11)>
- Node 2: <2, (9, 8, 12)>
- Node 0: No 3-stars as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 14: No 3-stars as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 12: <12, (5, 4, 2)>
- Node 11: <11, (5, 13, 6)>
- Node 3: No 3-stars as it has only 4 neighbors.
- Node 10: <10, (5, 8, 2)>
- Node 1: No 3-stars as it has only 3 neighbors.
- Node 6: No 3-stars as it has only 4 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 12, 13)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <4, (9, 12, 14)>, <8, (9, 13, 2)>, <13, (5, 8, 11)>, <2, (9, 8, 12)>, <12, (5, 4, 2)>, <11, (5, 13, 6)>.
