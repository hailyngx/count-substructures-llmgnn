Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 1) (7, 15) (7, 14) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 8) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 0) (18, 16) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 11) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 15) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 8) (12, 9) (12, 10) (16, 18) (16, 19) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 19) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are directly connected to node 6, which is the center node in a potential 3-star.

Nodes directly connected to node 6: 9, 5, 11, 0

Now, for each neighboring node of node 6, let's check if they are connected to exactly two other neighboring nodes of node 6. These would form 3-stars with node 6 as the center.

1. Node 9: Nodes directly connected to 9: 6, 8, 4, 12
   - Possible 3-star with 6 as the center: <6, (9, 8, 4)>
   
2. Node 5: Nodes directly connected to 5: 6, 7, 11
   - No valid 3-star found since each neighboring node of 5 is not connected to exactly two other neighboring nodes of node 6.

3. Node 11: Nodes directly connected to 11: 6, 3, 4, 5
   - Possible 3-star with 6 as the center: <6, (11, 3, 4)> 
   
4. Node 0: Nodes directly connected to 0: 6, 3, 4, 2
   - No valid 3-star found since each neighboring node of 0 is not connected to exactly two other neighboring nodes of node 6.

Final count of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <<6, (9, 8, 4)>, <6, (11, 3, 4)>>
