Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 11) (20, 15) (20, 9) (20, 24) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 4) (6, 0) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 24) (29, 17) (29, 3) (22, 27) (22, 16) (26, 28) (26, 16) (13, 15) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 14) (13, 7) (21, 10) (21, 2) (3, 29) (3, 7) (3, 10) (28, 17) (28, 26) (28, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 25) (0, 6) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 8) (16, 0) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (11, 15) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 18) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 21) (2, 28) (2, 19) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 23) (1, 19) (19, 2) (19, 1) (27, 22) (27, 24) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 12) (24, 20) (24, 17) (24, 27) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 11) (12, 25) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (23, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which could potentially be the center of a 3-star. 

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are 15, 20, 5, 6, 17, 10, 3, 26, 13, 9, 0, 16, 11, 7, 2, and 1.

Now let's list all unique 3-stars in the graph:
<15, (20, 13, 4)>
<20, (15, 9, 24)>
<5, (6, 13, 2)>
<6, (5, 18, 4)>
<17, (29, 28, 24)>
<10, (21, 3, 9)>
<3, (29, 7, 10)>
<26, (28, 16, 16)>
<13, (15, 5, 25)>
<9, (20, 8, 10)>
<0, (6, 16, 4)>
<16, (22, 26, 0)>
<11, (14, 15, 1)>
<7, (3, 13, 1)>
<2, (5, 21, 28)>
<1, (11, 7, 23)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
