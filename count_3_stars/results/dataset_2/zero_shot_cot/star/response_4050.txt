Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 10) (0, 1) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 2) (12, 3) (12, 11) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 11) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all 3-stars in the graph.

Given the graph connections, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<0, (1, 8, 10)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 11, 13)>
<3, (1, 9, 14)>
<4, (1, 8, 13)>
<5, (2, 6, 13)>
<6, (5, 9, 11)>
<7, (1, 10, 14)>
<8, (0, 4, 10)>
<9, (3, 6, 11)>
<10, (0, 7, 8)>
<11, (2, 6, 9)>
<12, (3, 11, 12)>
<13, (2, 4, 5)>
<14, (0, 3, 7)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
