Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 8) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 14) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 0) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 16) (2, 10) (2, 11) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 9) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 19) (14, 8) (18, 17) (18, 0) (0, 4) (0, 19) (0, 18) (0, 9) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by counting the total occurrences of nodes connected in a 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Let's go step by step:

1. Node 1 has edges with nodes 3, 5, 6, 8, and 13.
   - Possible 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (3, 5, 6)>

2. Node 3 has edges with nodes 1 and 8.
   - Possible 3-star centered at node 3: <3, (1, 8, 15)>

3. Node 15 has edges with nodes 6, 7, and 16.
   - Possible 3-star centered at node 15: <15, (6, 7, 16)>

4. Node 5 has edges with nodes 1 and 7.
   - Possible 3-star centered at node 5: <5, (1, 7, 19)>

5. Node 6 has edges with nodes 1, 15, and 19.
   - Possible 3-star centered at node 6: <6, (15, 19, 1)>

6. Node 16 has edges with nodes 10, 12, 15, and 9.
   - Possible 3-star centered at node 16: <16, (10, 12, 15)>

7. Node 8 has edges with nodes 1, 3, 14, and 19.
   - Possible 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (1, 3, 19)>

8. Node 19 has edges with nodes 6, 7, 8, 13, and 0.
   - Possible 3-star centered at node 19: <19, (6, 7, 13)>

9. Node 4 has edges with nodes 0, 11, 12.
   - No 3-star centered at node 4.

10. Node 10 has edges with nodes 2, 16, and 17.
    - No 3-star centered at node 10.

11. Node 17 has edges with nodes 10, 12, and 18.
    - No 3-star centered at node 17.

12. Node 2 has edges with nodes 10 and 11.
    - No 3-star centered at node 2.

13. Node 7 has edges with nodes 5, 15, and 19.
    - No 3-star centered at node 7.

14. Node 14 has an edge with node 8.
    - No 3-star centered at node 14.

15. Node 18 has edges with nodes 0 and 17.
    - No 3-star centered at node 18.

16. Node 0 has edges with nodes 4, 9, 18, and 19.
    - No 3-star centered at node 0.

17. Node 9 has edges with nodes 0, 13, and 16.
    - No 3-star centered at node 9.

18. Node 11 has edges with nodes 2 and 4.
    - No 3-star centered at node 11.

19. Node 12 has edges with nodes 4, 16, and 17.
    - No 3-star centered at node 12.

20. Node 13 has edges with nodes 1, 9, and 19.
    - No 3-star centered at node 13.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 8, 15)>
<15, (6, 7, 16)>
<5, (1, 7, 19)>
<6, (15, 19, 1)>
<16, (10, 12, 15)>
<8, (1, 3, 19)>
<19, (6, 7, 13)>
