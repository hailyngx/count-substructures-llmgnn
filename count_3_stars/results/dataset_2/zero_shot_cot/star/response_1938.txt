Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 2) (1, 17) (1, 18) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 18) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 10) (17, 1) (17, 6) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 19) (12, 5) (12, 19) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 17) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 12) (9, 16) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each other to form 3-star structures. 

The nodes connected to node 11 are: 16, 18, 5, 6
The nodes connected to node 16 are: 11, 18, 9
The nodes connected to node 3 are: 15, 14, 6
The nodes connected to node 15 are: 3, 8, 2
Node 8, 13, 4 are connected to each other forming a separate structure.

Now, we can start counting the number of 3-stars:
[<11, (16, 18, 5)>, <5, (11, 4, 12)>, <6, (11, 3, 7)>, <18, (11, 16, 1)>]

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
