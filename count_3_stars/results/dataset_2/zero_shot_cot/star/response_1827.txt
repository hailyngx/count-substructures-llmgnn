Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

The potential central nodes can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. We will check for each node if it is the central node of a 3-star.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 0: 
    - (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 6), (0, 3, 7), (0, 5, 2)
- For node 1:
    - (1, 0, 3), (1, 4, 7)
- For node 2:
    - (2, 0, 6), (2, 5, 8)
- For node 3:
    - (3, 0, 7), (3, 1, 4), (3, 4, 6), (3, 9, 8)
- For node 4:
    - (4, 1, 7), (4, 3, 6), (4, 6, 8), (4, 8, 9)
- For node 5:
    - (5, 0, 2)
- For node 6:
    - (6, 0, 2), (6, 3, 4), (6, 4, 8), (6, 7, 0)
- For node 7:
    - (7, 0, 3), (7, 1, 4), (7, 6, 0), (7, 8, 9)
- For node 8:
    - (8, 2, 5), (8, 3, 9), (8, 4, 9), (8, 6, 4), (8, 7, 9)
- For node 9:
    - (9, 3, 8), (9, 4, 8)

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found:
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 7, 0)>, <2, (5, 8, 0)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (8, 9, 4)>, <6, (7, 0, 2)>, <7, (8, 9, 4)>, <8, (4, 9, 6)> 

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.  
The final answer is [9].
