Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting from node 1: 
- <1, (3, 14, 8)> is a 3-star.
- <1, (2, 14, 13)> is a 3-star.

Moving on to node 2: 
- <2, (1, 13, 11)> is a 3-star.

Going to node 3: 
- <3, (1, 9, 6)> is a 3-star.

Then, node 4 has multiple 3-stars:
- <4, (7, 10, 9)> is a 3-star.
- <4, (8, 10, 7)> is a 3-star.
- <4, (9, 3, 7)> is a 3-star.
- <4, (10, 7, 3)> is a 3-star.

For node 5: 
- <5, (8, 13, 0)> is a 3-star.

Node 6: 
- <6, (3, 13, 14)> is a 3-star.

Next, node 7: 
- <7, (4, 10, 14)> is a 3-star.
- <7, (10, 11, 4)> is a 3-star.

Moving on to node 8: 
- <8, (4, 5, 1)> is a 3-star.

Then, node 9: 
- <9, (4, 7, 2)> is a 3-star.

Node 10: 
- <10, (4, 7, 11)> is a 3-star.

For node 11: 
- <11, (7, 10, 13)> is a 3-star.

Lastly, node 13: 
- <13, (1, 2, 5)> is a 3-star.

Counting these unique 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
