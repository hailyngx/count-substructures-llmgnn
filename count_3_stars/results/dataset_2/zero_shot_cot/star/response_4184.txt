Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 15) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 3) (19, 16) (1, 14) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 1) (8, 19) (8, 3) (18, 12) (18, 13) (2, 9) (2, 1) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 13) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 1) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 10, and 14: <9, (2, 10, 14)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 7, and 11: <4, (0, 7, 11)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 13, and 15: <7, (4, 13, 15)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 11, and 17: <10, (9, 11, 17)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 14, and 15: <1, (2, 14, 15)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 13, and 18: <12, (0, 13, 18)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 7, and 19: <16, (1, 7, 19)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 17, and 19: <3, (8, 17, 19)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
