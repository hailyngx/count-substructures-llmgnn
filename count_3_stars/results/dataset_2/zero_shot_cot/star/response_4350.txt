Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 9) (4, 14) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 16) (1, 14) (1, 13) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (13, 7) (13, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 6) (16, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 16) (18, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 19) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 11) (12, 3) (12, 0) (11, 18) (11, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 6)>
2. Node 15: <15, (7, 9, 19)>
3. Node 8: <8, (0, 14, 18)>
4. Node 5: <5, (6, 10, 17)>
5. Node 7: <7, (13, 15, 19)>
6. Node 17: <17, (2, 5, 10)>
7. Node 16: <16, (0, 6, 18)>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
