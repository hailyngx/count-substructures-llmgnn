Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 4, 2)>
<1, (3, 2, 5)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<5, (6, 4, 1)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<0, (6, 9, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
So, the final answer is [10].
