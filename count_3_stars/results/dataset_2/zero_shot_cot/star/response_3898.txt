Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. From node 10: <10, (8, 13, 9)>
2. From node 11: <11, (1, 0, 8)>
3. From node 5: <5, (13, 4, 3)>
4. From node 6: <6, (3, 12, 0)>
5. From node 2: <2, (9, 3, 7)>
6. From node 8: <8, (10, 11, 0)>
7. From node 13: <13, (10, 5, 4)>
8. From node 4: <4, (5, 2, 13)>
9. From node 12: <12, (11, 6, 0)>
10. From node 14: <14, (10, 3, 1)>
11. From node 1: <1, (11, 14, 0)>
12. From node 3: <3, (5, 6, 2)>
13. From node 7: <7, (5, 2, 14)>
14. From node 9: <9, (10, 2, 14)>
15. From node 0: <0, (11, 8, 13)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in this graph.
