Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 10) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes are potential central nodes for 3-stars.
  
From the given edges, we can see that nodes 6, 9, 4, 8, 7, 12, 0, 14, 5, and 13 are all connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 
Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. From node 6: <6, (9, 1, 10)>
2. From node 9: <9, (6, 8, 4)>
3. From node 4: <4, (9, 12, 2)>
4. From node 8: <8, (9, 3, 14)>
5. From node 7: <7, (11, 10, 5)>
6. From node 12: <12, (9, 4, 11)>
7. From node 0: <0, (14, 13, 5)>
8. From node 14: <14, (8, 1, 5)>
9. From node 5: <5, (4, 7, 0)>
10. From node 13: <13, (7, 3, 0)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [10].
