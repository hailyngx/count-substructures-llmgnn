Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node has exactly 3 edges connecting it to 3 other nodes. 

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:

1. Check each node in the graph.
2. If a node has exactly 3 edges connected to it, then it forms a 3-star.
3. List each unique 3-star found.
4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's go through the steps to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 edges (forming a 3-star):
- Node 5: (5, 3, 6), (5, 7, 10)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 6), (4, 3, 13)

Unique 3-stars found: 
<5, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars: [2]
