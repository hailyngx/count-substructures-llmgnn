Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 12) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 18) (18, 2) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 7) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (0, 17) (0, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph: 
<1, (3, 14, 15)>
<2, (14, 17, 18)>
<4, (0, 5, 15)>
<5, (4, 6, 13)>
<6, (5, 10, 11)> 
<7, (3, 9, 19)> 
<8, (10, 13, 19)>
<9, (3, 12, 10)>
<10, (6, 9, 13)>
<11, (6, 12, 17)>
<12, (1, 9, 15)>
<13, (5, 10, 19)>
<14, (1, 2, 17)>
<15, (1, 4, 12)>
<17, (2, 11, 14)>
<19, (7, 8, 13)>

There are 16 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [16].
