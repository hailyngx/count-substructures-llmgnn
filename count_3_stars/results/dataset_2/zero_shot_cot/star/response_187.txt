Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 15) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 14) (16, 10) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 13) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 5) (7, 2) (19, 17) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the unique sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. Identify the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 12.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5, 15, and 0.

2. Find the number of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 10, 13)>
- <5, (2, 7, 12)>
- <6, (8, 9, 12)>
- <14, (9, 11, 15)>
- <15, (14, 17, 18)>
- <18, (5, 15, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
