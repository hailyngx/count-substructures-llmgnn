Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Checking the graph, we can derive the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
