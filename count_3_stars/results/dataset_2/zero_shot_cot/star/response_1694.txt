Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 1) (14, 0) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 15) (8, 0) (19, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 13) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 18) (12, 3) (12, 0) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 15) (18, 6) (18, 16) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (17, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. The nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 10
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 14
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 9
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 11, 2
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 9, 13
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 11, 5, 15
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 14, 12
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 2
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 11, 13
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 18

2. Counting the 3-stars:
- From the above list, we can see the following unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 0, 2)>
<7, (4, 3, 10)>
<1, (7, 3, 14)>
<3, (7, 1, 9)>
<10, (7, 11, 2)>
<11, (10, 9, 13)>
<6, (11, 5, 15)>
<0, (4, 14, 12)>
<15, (5, 6, 2)>
<9, (3, 11, 13)>
<16, (6, 9, 18)>

3. Counting the total number of 3-stars:
There are 11 unique 3-stars found.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
