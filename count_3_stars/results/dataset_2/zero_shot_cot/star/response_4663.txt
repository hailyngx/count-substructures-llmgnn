Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After examining the provided edges, the nodes that have exactly three incident edges are: 4, 7, 12, 1. These could potentially be centers of 3-stars. 

Next, we find all possible 3-stars with these nodes as the center:
1. <4, (8, 9, 0)>
2. <7, (8, 10, 14)>
3. <12, (10, 9, 6)>
4. <1, (6, 13, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
