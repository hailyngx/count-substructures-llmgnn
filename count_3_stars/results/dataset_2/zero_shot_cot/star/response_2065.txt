Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in the graph:
- Nodes connected to node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 8, 11, 13
- Nodes connected to node 10: 2, 6, 12, 14
- Nodes connected to node 11: 3, 9, 12
- Nodes connected to node 12: 5, 8, 10, 11, 13

Now, we can count the number of 3-star configurations:
- For node 1: (1, 0, 2), (1, 3, 8), (1, 7, 2)
- For node 3: (3, 1, 8), (3, 11, 12), (3, 13, 0)
- For node 10: (10, 2, 14), (10, 6, 12)
- For node 11: (11, 3, 12), (11, 9, 13)
- For node 12: (12, 5, 10)

So, there are a total of [9] 3-star configurations in the given graph:
<1, (0, 2, 1)>, <1, (3, 8, 1)>, <1, (7, 2, 1)>, 
<3, (1, 8, 3)>, <3, (11, 12, 3)>, <3, (13, 0, 3)>,
<10, (2, 14, 10)>, <10, (6, 12, 10)>,
<12, (5, 10, 12)>.
