Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

The counts of edges incident to each node are:
Node 0: 4 edges
Node 1: 4 edges
Node 2: 5 edges
Node 3: 5 edges
Node 4: 4 edges
Node 5: 2 edges
Node 6: 5 edges
Node 7: 5 edges
Node 8: 4 edges
Node 9: 4 edges

Next, we need to find the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<(1, 3, 6), 7>
<2, (1, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<9, (2, 8, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found: [9]
