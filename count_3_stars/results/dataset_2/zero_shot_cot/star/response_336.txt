Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 23) (29, 21) (3, 21) (25, 19) (25, 14) (22, 23) (22, 10) (23, 29) (23, 22) (23, 4) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 11) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 20) (27, 13) (27, 16) (4, 23) (4, 26) (8, 10) (8, 21) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 26) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 24) (5, 16) (13, 29) (13, 27) (13, 18) (26, 29) (26, 4) (26, 6) (26, 28) (26, 14) (21, 29) (21, 3) (21, 8) (14, 2) (14, 25) (14, 26) (14, 10) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (10, 22) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 0) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 27) (24, 28) (24, 11) (24, 1) (7, 6) (7, 28) (15, 0) (15, 17) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 1) (17, 6) (17, 15) (1, 24) (1, 19) (1, 20) (1, 16) (20, 27) (20, 1) (9, 16) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 9) (18, 13) (18, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided. 

Starting from the first node, let's find all the 3-stars:

<2, (12, 14, 11)>
<29, (26, 13, 23)>
<3, (21, 8, -)>
<25, (19, 14, -)>
<22, (23, 10, -)>
<12, (2, 27, 6)>
<27, (12, 24, 20)>
<4, (23, 26, -)>
<8, (10, 21, -)>
<6, (12, 28, 17)>
<28, (6, 26, 7)>
<5, (16, -, 13)>
<13, (29, 27, 18)>
<26, (29, 4, 6)>
<21, (29, 3, 8)>
<14, (2, 25, 26)>
<0, (10, 15, 19)>
<10, (22, 8, 14)>
<11, (2, 12, 24)>
<24, (27, 28, 11)>
<7, (6, 28, -)>
<15, (0, 17, -)>
<19, (25, 0, 1)>
<17, (6, 15, -)>
<1, (24, 19, 20)>
<20, (27, 1, -)>
<9, (16, -, -)>
<18, (13, 11, -)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
[28]
