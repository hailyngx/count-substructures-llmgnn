Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 19) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 23) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 4) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 6) (2, 15) (18, 1) (18, 27) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 22) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 19) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 12) (22, 9) (22, 28) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 24) (13, 5) (21, 23) (26, 14) (26, 7) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 27) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 0) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 24) (29, 4) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 22) (28, 27) (27, 18) (27, 26) (27, 28) (8, 3) (8, 26) (8, 15) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 29) (6, 16) (6, 20) (6, 12) (15, 2) (15, 8) (23, 14) (23, 3) (23, 7) (23, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-stars in the graph based on the edges provided.

1. From node 1: (1, 17), (1, 3), (1, 19), (1, 9), (1, 18)
2. From node 3: (3, 1), (3, 25), (3, 23), (3, 8)
3. From node 5: (5, 11), (5, 13), (5, 26), (5, 24)
4. From node 9: (9, 17), (9, 1), (9, 20), (9, 22), (9, 28)
5. From node 12: (12, 7), (12, 6), (12, 22)
6. From node 14: (14, 17), (14, 26), (14, 23)
7. From node 16: (16, 11), (16, 6)
8. From node 17: (17, 14), (17, 1), (17, 9), (17, 19)
9. From node 20: (20, 25), (20, 9), (20, 4), (20, 6)
10. From node 22: (22, 12), (22, 9), (22, 28)
11. From node 26: (26, 14), (26, 7), (26, 5), (26, 8), (26, 27)
12. From node 29: (29, 7), (29, 0), (29, 24), (29, 4)
13. From node 0: (0, 28), (0, 29), (0, 19)
14. From node 7: (7, 12), (7, 29), (7, 23), (7, 26)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<1, (17, 3, 9)>
<1, (17, 9, 19)>
<1, (3, 1, 19)>
<1, (1, 9, 18)>
<3, (1, 25, 8)>
<5, (11, 13, 24)>
<9, (17, 1, 20)>
<9, (17, 9, 28)>
<9, (9, 20, 22)>
<12, (7, 6, 22)>
<14, (17, 26, 23)>
<16, (11, 6, 16)>
<20, (25, 9, 4)>
<22, (12, 9, 22)>
<26, (7, 5, 8)>
<27, (18, 26, 27)>
<29, (7, 24, 29)>
<0, (28, 29, 19)>

There are a total of [17] 3-stars in the given graph.
