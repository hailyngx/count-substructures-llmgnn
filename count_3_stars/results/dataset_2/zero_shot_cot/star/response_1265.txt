Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 8) (15, 27) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 15) (27, 16) (27, 23) (25, 3) (25, 15) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 16) (26, 19) (26, 8) (26, 7) (19, 26) (19, 24) (19, 6) (19, 9) (24, 19) (24, 14) (24, 2) (7, 26) (7, 20) (7, 23) (7, 2) (13, 4) (13, 29) (13, 0) (17, 0) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 22) (4, 5) (12, 17) (12, 20) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 11) (22, 4) (22, 16) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 24) (14, 11) (14, 20) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 29) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 28) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 14) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 21) (9, 19) (9, 21) (9, 2) (9, 10) (16, 27) (16, 1) (16, 22) (16, 29) (18, 10) (18, 29) (5, 4) (5, 21) (5, 10) (29, 15) (29, 13) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 18) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 5) (10, 28) (8, 3) (8, 26) (28, 2) (28, 10) (23, 27) (23, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 21, 29)>
<5, (4, 10, 21)>
<10, (5, 18, 28)>
<13, (0, 29, 4)>
<15, (25, 27, 29)>
<16, (1, 22, 29)>
<19, (6, 9, 24)>
<21, (5, 29, 0)>
<22, (4, 16, 29)>
<24, (2, 14, 19)>
<25, (3, 15, 29)>
<26, (7, 8, 19)>
<27, (15, 23, 29)>
<28, (2, 10, 18)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [15] 3-stars in the graph.
