Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 6) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 12) (15, 1) (15, 16) (19, 2) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 7) (18, 5) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 16) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center. We will use this information to count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

In this graph, the center node is 0, and the nodes connected to it are 2, 16, and 17.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

1. First 3-star: <0, (2, 16, 17)>
2. Second 3-star: <2, (0, 16, 7)>
3. Third 3-star: <16, (0, 2, 14)>
4. Fourth 3-star: <17, (0, 10, 7)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars: [4].
