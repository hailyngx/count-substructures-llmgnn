Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 15) (17, 18) (5, 6) (5, 10) (5, 14) (0, 15) (0, 13) (7, 18) (1, 11) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 15) (8, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 19) (4, 19) (4, 3) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 3) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 19) (3, 18) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its 3 neighbors for each 3-star. 

1. Central node 11: (1, 9, 15)
2. Central node 16: (17, 11, X)
3. Central node 6: (1, 2, 9)
4. Central node 9: (11, 6, 19)
5. Central node 10: (17, 5, X)
6. Central node 17: (16, 10, 15)
7. Central node 5: (6, 10, 14)
8. Central node 0: (13, 15, X)
9. Central node 18: (3, 7, 11)
10. Central node 1: (6, 11, X)
11. Central node 2: (6, 9, X)
12. Central node 8: (3, 15, X)
13. Central node 14: (5, 8, 12)
14. Central node 4: (3, 19, X)
15. Central node 19: (4, 9, 14)
16. Central node 15: (0, 8, X)
17. Central node 12: (13, 14, X)
18. Central node 13: (0, 12, X)
19. Central node 3: (8, 4, 18)
20. Central node 7: (18, X, X)

There are seven unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<11, (1, 9, 15)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (6, 11, 19)>
<17, (16, 10, 15)>
<5, (6, 10, 14)>
<18, (3, 7, 11)>
<8, (3, 15, X)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
