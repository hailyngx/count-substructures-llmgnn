Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (6, 16) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 7) (18, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 2) (14, 0) (5, 15) (5, 19) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 16) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 19) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 15) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 7) (8, 10) (8, 18) (8, 0) (8, 17) (17, 2) (17, 19) (17, 8) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. A 3-star has one central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. Start by listing all the nodes connected to three other nodes:

   - Node 3 is connected to 4, 0, and 10.
   - Node 15 is connected to 2, 16, and 5.
   - Node 9 is connected to 1, 11, and 3.
   - Node 10 is connected to 8, 4, and 3.
   - Node 16 is connected to 6, 7, and 15.
   - Node 13 is connected to 12, 1, and 4.
   - Node 12 is connected to 16, 4, and 13.
   - Node 1 is connected to 19, 13, and 9.
   - Node 7 is connected to 16, 19, and 18.
   - Node 8 is connected to 0, 17, and 10.
   - Node 17 is connected to 8, 19, and 2.
   - Node 19 is connected to 1, 17, and 5.
   - Node 4 is connected to 13, 12, and 10.

3. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

   <3, (4, 0, 10)>
   <15, (2, 16, 5)>
   <9, (1, 11, 3)>
   <10, (8, 4, 3)>
   <16, (6, 7, 15)>
   <13, (12, 1, 4)>
   <12, (16, 4, 13)>
   <1, (19, 13, 9)>
   <7, (16, 19, 18)>
   <8, (0, 17, 10)>
   <17, (8, 19, 2)>
   <19, (1, 17, 5)>
   <4, (13, 12, 10)>

4. Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have:
