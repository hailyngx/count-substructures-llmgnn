Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 23) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 9) (20, 22) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 26) (29, 16) (29, 0) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 26) (26, 29) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 23) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 21) (16, 22) (21, 16) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 11) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 14) (11, 21) (11, 18) (14, 5) (14, 4) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (9, 3) (9, 20) (25, 24) (0, 29) (0, 23) (0, 28) (28, 0) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 24) (2, 1) (2, 3) (12, 20) (12, 28) (6, 4) (7, 18) (27, 17) (27, 21) (27, 28) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 7) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 24) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 24) (24, 25) (24, 28) (24, 22) (24, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars can be any node with degree 3. Let's list them down based on the given edges:

1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, let's identify the possible 3-stars. The notation <center, (leaf1, leaf2, leaf3)> represents a 3-star with the center node and its three connected nodes.

<4, (15, 10, 24)>
<5, (1, 26, 14)>
<10, (3, 8, 18)>
<13, (8, 23, 26)>
<15, (20, 19, 4)>
<16, (17, 21, 22)>
<18, (15, 11, 7)>
<20, (15, 12, 22)>
<22, (20, 16, 24)>
<24, (4, 25, 28)>
<26, (29, 19, 23)>
<27, (17, 21, 28)>
<28, (24, 0, 27)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
