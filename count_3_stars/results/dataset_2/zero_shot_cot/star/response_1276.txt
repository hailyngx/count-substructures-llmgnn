Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (17, 15) (17, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (11, 14) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (7, 18) (7, 1) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 18) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (1, 7) (1, 19) (1, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 8) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 1) (4, 17) (4, 3) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 2, 7, 11, 19.

Now, let's identify the leaves of each 3-star to form unique 3-stars:

<2, (9, 10, 5)>
<7, (18, 1, 19)>
<11, (14, 8, 4)>
<19, (1, 18, 7)>

There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Thus, the final answer is [4].
