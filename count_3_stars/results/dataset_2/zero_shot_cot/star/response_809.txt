Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors (leaves) connected to them. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Central node 0:
   - Leaves: 2, 3, 5

2. Central node 1:
   - Leaves: 0, 5, 7

3. Central node 2:
   - Leaves: 0, 6, 8

4. Central node 3:
   - Leaves: 0, 5, 6

5. Central node 4:
   - Leaves: 0, 8, 9

6. Central node 5:
   - Leaves: 0, 1, 3

7. Central node 6:
   - Leaves: 2, 3, 9

8. Central node 8:
   - Leaves: 2, 4, 5

9. Central node 9:
   - Leaves: 4, 6, 8

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the final answer is:
[9]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
