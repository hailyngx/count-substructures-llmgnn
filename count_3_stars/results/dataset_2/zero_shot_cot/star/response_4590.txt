Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 26) (16, 11) (16, 24) (2, 29) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 5) (1, 26) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 22) (26, 11) (26, 1) (26, 0) (17, 29) (17, 7) (5, 29) (5, 24) (6, 24) (6, 19) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 12) (21, 18) (10, 21) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (8, 11) (8, 27) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 23) (25, 1) (25, 27) (25, 4) (25, 22) (25, 14) (27, 21) (27, 8) (27, 25) (24, 16) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 22) (24, 20) (4, 2) (4, 25) (4, 22) (22, 1) (22, 25) (22, 24) (22, 4) (7, 17) (7, 20) (7, 18) (20, 24) (20, 7) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 12) (28, 9) (28, 14) (0, 26) (0, 15) (0, 12) (18, 21) (18, 7) (18, 12) (13, 11) (23, 19) (12, 21) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 18) (14, 15) (14, 25) (14, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list down all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<11, (13, 3, 8)>
<16, (24, 11, 5)>
<29, (17, 2, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 29)>
<1, (22, 19, 26)>
<26, (0, 11, 1)>
<17, (5, 7, 29)>
<5, (24, 29, 7)>
<24, (20, 22, 16)>
<3, (11, 2, 21)>
<21, (12, 18, 27)>
<10, (15, 21, None)>
<15, (0, 10, 14)>
<8, (11, 27, None)>
<19, (1, 6, 23)>
<25, (4, 14, 22)>
<27, (8, 21, 25)>
<22, (4, 24, 25)>
<7, (18, 17, 20)>
<20, (24, 7, None)>
<4, (2, 25, None)>
<9, (12, 28, None)>
<0, (12, 15, 26)>
<18, (7, 12, 21)>
<12, (0, 9, 18)>
<14, (25, 15, 28)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph: [25]
