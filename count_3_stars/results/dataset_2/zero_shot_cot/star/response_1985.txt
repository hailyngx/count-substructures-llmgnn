Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 25) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 15) (22, 24) (22, 12) (20, 29) (20, 26) (20, 2) (25, 18) (25, 15) (25, 21) (8, 5) (8, 0) (23, 4) (23, 17) (3, 21) (3, 5) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 29) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 6) (17, 23) (17, 27) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 26) (21, 25) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 14) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 10) (15, 28) (19, 29) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 9) (6, 7) (24, 22) (24, 11) (24, 4) (12, 22) (12, 21) (12, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (26, 20) (26, 29) (14, 21) (14, 16) (14, 2) (2, 20) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 2) (1, 27) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 16) (4, 23) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 2) (4, 28) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 13) (9, 11) (9, 19) (28, 15) (28, 4) (13, 19) (13, 27) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph containing 30 nodes and 90 edges, we will first identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars based on the definition provided.

A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. So, for each node in the graph, we will check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (1, 14, 4)>
<4, (2, 24, 28)>
<5, (8, 10, 16)>
<7, (0, 6, 11)>
<9, (11, 13, 19)>
<15, (22, 10, 28)>
<16, (12, 10, 5)>
<19, (4, 13, 29)>
<20, (26, 2, 29)>
<21, (12, 14, 25)>
<22, (15, 24, 27)>
<24, (22, 4, 11)>
<25, (18, 15, 21)>
<26, (20, 29, 2)>
<27, (1, 13, 17)>
<29, (0, 19, 26)>

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [16]
