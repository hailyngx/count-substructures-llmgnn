Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (16, 19) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 4) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 8) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 7) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 14) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 9, and 17.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 9, 13, and 15.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 10, 18, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 17.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 19, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 13.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 12, 15, and 19.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 13, 15, and 17.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 8, 11, and 12.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 13, and 15.
- Node 16 is connected to node 19.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 13, and 17.
- Node 18 is connected to node 4.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 16.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (2, 12, 17)>
<3, (5, 9, 13)>
<4, (0, 8, 18)>
<5, (6, 17, 2)>
<7, (0, 8, 13)>
<9, (1, 12, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
