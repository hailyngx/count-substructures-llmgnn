Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars based on the provided edges:

1. (5, 9, 0)
2. (9, 8, 4)
3. (4, 2, 8)
4. (7, 9, 8)
5. (8, 6, 2)
6. (6, 5, 2)
7. (2, 5, 0)
8. (0, 9, 5)
9. (1, 4, 2)
10. (3, 7, 8)
11. (5, 6, 2)
12. (6, 8, 2)

Now, let's simplify and count the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 0, 6)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (8, 2, 1)>
<6, (5, 8, 2)>
<2, (5, 0, 6)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
