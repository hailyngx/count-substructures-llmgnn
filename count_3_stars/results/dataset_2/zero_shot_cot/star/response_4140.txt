Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 28) (16, 1) (9, 4) (9, 13) (26, 14) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 27) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (29, 3) (29, 10) (3, 26) (3, 29) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 7) (25, 6) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (27, 26) (27, 24) (27, 10) (27, 20) (0, 2) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 12) (20, 27) (20, 0) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 22) (28, 16) (28, 21) (28, 17) (28, 7) (28, 10) (17, 28) (7, 25) (7, 0) (7, 28) (7, 5) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 27) (10, 28) (10, 18) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 22) (22, 21) (22, 4) (22, 5) (22, 24) (24, 27) (24, 22) (19, 15) (19, 23) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 22) (6, 25) (6, 14) (18, 10) (18, 23) (18, 1) (23, 19) (23, 18) (23, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 18) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected in the form of a 3-star.

Observations:
- A 3-star graph consists of a center node that is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<3, (26, 29, 25)>
<10, (27, 15, 18)>
<13, (9, 8, 15)>
<15, (13, 10, 19)>
<18, (10, 23, 1)>
<22, (4, 5, 24)>
<23, (19, 18, 12)>
<26, (14, 21, 27)>
<28, (16, 21, 17)>
<27, (26, 10, 24)>
