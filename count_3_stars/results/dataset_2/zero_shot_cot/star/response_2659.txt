Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star. As mentioned earlier, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (6, 7, 5)>
<1, (11, 8, 13)>
<2, (14, 10, 5)>
<3, (9, 7, 13)>
<4, (14, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 12, 13)>
<6, (10, 11, 0)>
<7, (4, 3, 0)>
<8, (1, 14, 11)>
<9, (3, 4, 11)>
<10, (6, 4, 2)>
<11, (9, 1, 6)>
<12, (13, 2, 14)>
<13, (8, 3, 1)>
<14, (4, 12, 8)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
