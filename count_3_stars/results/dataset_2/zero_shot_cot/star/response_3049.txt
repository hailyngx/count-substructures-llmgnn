Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 4) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 8) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 13) (18, 9) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 17) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 4) (9, 18) (9, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 1) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 9) (4, 6) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 14) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with three neighbors:
- Node 3 has neighbors 11, 15, 17.
- Node 10 has neighbors 0, 5, 15.
- Node 17 has neighbors 11, 12, 3.
- Node 2 has neighbors 5, 13, 16.
- Node 14 has neighbors 0, 3, 13.
- Node 8 has neighbors 7, 16, 17.
- Node 4 has neighbors 6, 9, 16.
- Node 13 has neighbors 2, 14, 18.
- Node 1 has neighbors 5, 7.
- Node 6 has neighbors 4, 10, 11.

2. Identify 3-stars from the nodes above:
- From node 3: <3, (11, 15, 17)>
- From node 10: <10, (0, 5, 15)>
- From node 17: <17, (11, 12, 3)>
- From node 2: <2, (5, 13, 16)>
- From node 14: <14, (0, 3, 13)>
- From node 8: <8, (7, 16, 17)>
- From node 4: <4, (6, 9, 16)>
- From node 13: <13, (2, 14, 18)>
- From node 1: <1, (5, 7, 1)>
- From node 6: <6, (4, 10, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
