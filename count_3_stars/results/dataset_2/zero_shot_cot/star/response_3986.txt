Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 15) (6, 2) (6, 19) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (17, 5) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 16) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 14) (18, 15) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 12) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 6) (15, 7) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 9) (9, 15) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through each node and its neighbors to identify any 3-stars:

1. Node 1: Connected to nodes 17, 13, 8.
2. Node 2: Connected to node 6. (Not a 3-star)
3. Node 3: Connected to nodes 13, 14, 12.
4. Node 4: Connected to nodes 10, 16, 11.
5. Node 5: Connected to nodes 7, 17, 15.
6. Node 6: Connected to nodes 2, 19. (Not a 3-star)
7. Node 7: Connected to nodes 5, 16, 15.
8. Node 8: Connected to nodes 1, 19, 15.
9. Node 9: Connected to node 15. (Not a 3-star)
10. Node 10: Connected to nodes 4, 1, 14.
11. Node 11: Connected to nodes 4, 19, 12.
12. Node 12: Connected to nodes 3, 14, 11.
13. Node 13: Connected to nodes 1, 17, 3.
14. Node 14: Connected to nodes 18, 3, 12.
15. Node 15: Connected to nodes 7, 5, 8, 18, 9.
16. Node 16: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 17.
17. Node 17: Connected to nodes 5, 1, 16.
18. Node 18: Connected to nodes 8, 19, 14, 15.
19. Node 19: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 18, 11.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (17, 13, 8)>
<1, (17, 1, 10)>
<1, (13, 1, 8)>
<4, (10, 16, 11)>
<4, (10, 1, 14)>
<4, (16, 7, 17)>
<5, (7, 16, 15)>
<7, (16, 17, 5)>
<8, (1, 17, 13)>
<11, (4, 16, 7)>
<15, (7, 5, 8)>
<16, (4, 7, 17)>
<17, (5, 1, 16)>
<18, (8, 19, 15)>
<19, (8, 18, 14)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [15].
