Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 2) (15, 8) (15, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 5) (10, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 16) (7, 18) (16, 7) (12, 15) (12, 13) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 17) (4, 13) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential central nodes for the 3-star graphs.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 13, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

Now, let's find the 3-star graphs with each of these nodes as the central node:

<0, (3, 6, 2)>
<2, (17, 4, 0)>
<4, (17, 13, 14)>
<5, (1, 11, 10)>
<6, (8, 0, 3)>
<8, (15, 9, 6)>
<9, (13, 7, 11)>
<13, (9, 12, 1)>
<15, (8, 12, 15)>
<17, (2, 7, 4)>
<18, (7, 11, 14)>
<19, (1, 10, 19)>

Therefore, there are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
