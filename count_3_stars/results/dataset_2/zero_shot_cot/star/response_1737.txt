Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 2) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 5) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 7) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 28) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 6) (18, 13) (28, 4) (28, 19) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 12) (26, 18) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 5) (1, 16) (1, 29) (1, 7) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 25) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (23, 11) (23, 0) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 25) (5, 16) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 10) (29, 11) (29, 1) (29, 24) (0, 3) (0, 23) (0, 25) (24, 16) (24, 29) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 2) (27, 19) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 25) (13, 19) (19, 28) (19, 27) (19, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 12) (25, 8) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 13) (17, 15) (17, 22) (17, 9) (6, 15) (6, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. This is a property unique to the central node of a 3-star.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 11, 16, 4, 18, 28, 26, 1, 9, 2, 12, and 29. 

Next, we identify the three leaves attached to each of these central nodes to form 3-stars. 
Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<11, (16, 2, 29)>
<16, (11, 24, 1)>
<4, (18, 13, 28)>
<18, (11, 26, 6)>
<28, (4, 19, 27)>
<26, (18, 22, 14)>
<1, (16, 29, 7)>
<9, (16, 8, 17)>
<2, (11, 12, 7)>
<12, (2, 10, 22)>
<29, (11, 1, 24)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
