Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (4, 17) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 15) (2, 16) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 7) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 3) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 18) (12, 16) (12, 14) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 17) (3, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes. We will then count the unique 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes that are part of 3-stars in the given graph are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

Now, let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<2, (16, 8, 5)>
<3, (17, 4, 14)>
<4, (17, 3, 14)>
<5, (18, 0, 6)>
<6, (15, 7, 17)>
<7, (15, 6, 10)>
<8, (2, 16, 13)>
<9, (14, 18, 9)>
<10, (14, 7, 13)>
<11, (19, 16, 10)>
<12, (14, 16, 12)>
<13, (16, 8, 7)>
<14, (1, 3, 9)>
<15, (7, 6, 15)>
<16, (2, 12, 11)>
<17, (6, 3, 4)>
<18, (19, 5, 9)>
<19, (11, 18, 16)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
