Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 29) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (10, 28) (10, 29) (11, 7) (11, 23) (23, 4) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 1) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 6) (15, 20) (15, 24) (6, 7) (6, 20) (6, 28) (28, 10) (28, 6) (26, 14) (26, 27) (1, 23) (1, 25) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (13, 5) (13, 20) (13, 2) (29, 21) (29, 10) (29, 12) (25, 1) (25, 19) (27, 26) (27, 16) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 25) (19, 24) (14, 23) (14, 26) (14, 1) (12, 29) (12, 16) (12, 17) (16, 27) (16, 12) (8, 3) (8, 17) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 24) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 19) (24, 2) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify the central node and the leaves connected to it.

The potential central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.

Now, for each central node, we will check if it forms a 3-star. A 3-star requires the central node to be connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (9, 18, 22)>
<0, (9, 17, 0)>
<1, (23, 14, 25)>
<2, (10, 13, 24)>
<3, (4, 2, 8)>
<6, (7, 20, 28)>
<7, (4, 21, 11)>
<9, (18, 0, 17)>
<10, (19, 29, 2)>
<11, (23, 7, 14)>
<13, (5, 20, 2)>
<14, (23, 1, 26)>
<16, (27, 12, 17)>
<17, (18, 0, 8)>
<18, (9, 22, 19)>
<19, (21, 18, 25)>
<20, (0, 13, 6)>
<21, (7, 19, 29)>
<22, (18, 0, 10)>
<23, (4, 11, 1)>
<24, (7, 15, 2)>
<25, (1, 19, 14)>
<26, (14, 27, 16)>
<27, (26, 16, 12)>
<28, (10, 6, 24)>
<29, (21, 10, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: 28
So, the answer is [28].
