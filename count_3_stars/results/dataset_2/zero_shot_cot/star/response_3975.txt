Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step-by-step to count the number of 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify all nodes with degree 1. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars.
Nodes with degree 1: 9, 4, 0

Step 2: For each node identified in step 1, find its neighbors and check if they form 3-stars.
For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 2 and node 7 are not connected, so there are no 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6 and 5.
- Node 6 and node 5 are connected, forming a 3-star with node 4 as the center. <4, (6, 5, x)>, where x is the node not connected to node 4.

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 3, and 2.
- Nodes 7, 1, and 3 form a 3-star with node 0 as the center. <0, (7, 1, 3)>

Step 3: Count the total number of 3-stars found.

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (6, 5, x)>
<0, (7, 1, 3)>
