Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star structure. 

Let's list down the possible 3-star structures:
<0, (1, 5, 2)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (1, 0, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 0)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 9, 0)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<7, (6, 1, 4)>
<8, (4, 3, 2)>
<9, (5, 3, 4)>

Now we count the number of occurrences of each unique 3-star structure in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 2)> - 2 occurrences
<1, (0, 2, 7)> - 2 occurrences
<2, (1, 0, 8)> - 2 occurrences
<3, (5, 9, 0)> - 2 occurrences
<4, (6, 7, 8)> - 2 occurrences
<5, (3, 9, 0)> - 2 occurrences
<6, (4, 7, 5)> - 2 occurrences
<7, (6, 1, 4)> - 2 occurrences
<8, (4, 3, 2)> - 2 occurrences
<9, (5, 3, 4)> - 2 occurrences

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
