Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 2 to find possible 3-stars involving node 2:
1. Node 3, 7, 8, 11, and 13 are connected to node 2.

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 8 to find possible 3-stars involving node 8:
1. Node 0, 2, 5, and 7 are connected to node 8.

Now, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0 to find possible 3-stars involving node 0:
1. Node 3, 4, 5, 8, and 14 are connected to node 0.

Then, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 14 to find possible 3-stars involving node 14:
1. Node 0, 7, and 10 are connected to node 14.

Now, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 3 to find possible 3-stars involving node 3:
1. Node 0, 2, 5, 7, and 10 are connected to node 3.

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 11 to find possible 3-stars involving node 11:
1. Node 2, 9, 12, and 13 are connected to node 11.

Then, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 4 to find possible 3-stars involving node 4:
1. Node 0 and 12 are connected to node 4.

Now, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 12 to find possible 3-stars involving node 12:
1. Node 4, 5, 6, and 11 are connected to node 12.

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1 to find possible 3-stars involving node 1:
1. Node 9 and 10 are connected to node 1.

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars present in the graph:
1. There are <2, (3, 7, 8)> 3-star.
2. There are <0, (2, 5, 8)> 3-star.
3. There are <14, (0, 7, 10)> 3-star.
4. There are <3, (0, 2, 5)> 3-star.
5. There are <11, (2, 9, 13)> 3-star.
6. There are <4, (0, 5, 12)> 3-star.
7. There are <12, (4, 5, 6)> 3-star.
8. There are <1, (9, 10, 1)> 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
