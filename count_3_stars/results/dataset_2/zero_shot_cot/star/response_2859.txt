Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:
1. Node 1: (4, 5, 6)
2. Node 2: (5, 1, 7)
3. Node 3: (5, 7, 9)
4. Node 4: (8, 5, 6)
5. Node 5: (4, 8, 1)
6. Node 6: (4, 7, 0)
7. Node 7: (8, 5, 6)
8. Node 8: (4, 9, 7)
9. Node 9: (8, 7, 3)
10. Node 0: (8, 6, 1)

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
