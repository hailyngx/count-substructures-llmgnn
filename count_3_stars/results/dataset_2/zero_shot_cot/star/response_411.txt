Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:
- Node 5 has 4 edges connected to nodes 9, 11, 3, and 7, forming 1 3-star <5, (9, 11, 3)>.
- Node 9 has 5 edges connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 13, and 12, forming 1 3-star <9, (5, 6, 8)>.
- Node 6 has 3 edges connected to nodes 9, 1, and 4, forming 1 3-star <6, (9, 1, 4)>.
- Node 10 has 4 edges connected to nodes 11, 8, 1, and 4, forming 1 3-star <10, (11, 8, 1)>.
- Node 11 has 4 edges connected to nodes 5, 10, 13, and 2, forming 1 3-star <11, (5, 10, 13)>.
- Node 2 has 5 edges connected to nodes 11, 8, 12, 4, and 7, forming 1 3-star <2, (11, 8, 12)>.
- Node 8 has 5 edges connected to nodes 9, 10, 2, 1, and 7, forming 1 3-star <8, (9, 10, 2)>.
- Node 12 has 5 edges connected to nodes 9, 2, 14, 3, and 4, forming 1 3-star <12, (9, 2, 14)>.
- Node 1 has 5 edges connected to nodes 6, 10, 8, 14, and 13, forming 1 3-star <1, (6, 10, 8)>.
- Node 7 has 4 edges connected to nodes 5, 2, 8, and 13, forming 1 3-star <7, (5, 2, 8)>.
- Node 13 has 4 edges connected to nodes 9, 11, 1, and 7, forming 1 3-star <13, (9, 11, 1)>.
Therefore, there are 10 distinct 3-stars in this graph, so the output is [10].
