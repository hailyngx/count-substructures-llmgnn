Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 8) (10, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 10) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (1, 10, 14)>
<9, (4, 6, 1)>
<6, (2, 8, 0)>
<4, (0, 9, 14)>
<7, (1, 10, 12)>
<12, (7, 11, 13)>
<13, (5, 7, 10)>
<3, (11, 9, 1)>
<11, (9, 7, 12)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 4)>
<10, (5, 13, 7)>
<14, (5, 4, 13)>
<2, (6, 1, 10)>
<8, (6, 1, 0)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is 15.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
