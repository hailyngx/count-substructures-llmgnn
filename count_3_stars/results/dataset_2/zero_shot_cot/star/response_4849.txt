Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 26) (3, 17) (3, 4) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 12) (1, 21) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 29) (27, 17) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 17) (6, 5) (6, 29) (6, 22) (6, 26) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 26) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 29) (13, 4) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 24) (0, 17) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 5) (17, 0) (23, 11) (23, 21) (23, 19) (14, 28) (14, 29) (26, 16) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 7) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (28, 8) (28, 14) (28, 18) (9, 10) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 24) (20, 7) (20, 22) (20, 24) (19, 23) (19, 25) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 12) (29, 14) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 20) (18, 5) (18, 28) (22, 11) (22, 15) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the central nodes which have exactly three adjacent nodes.

The nodes with exactly three adjacent nodes are: 11, 15, 16, 25.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<11, (16, 22, 23)>
<15, (12, 22, 25)>
<16, (11, 26, 5)>
<25, (15, 19, 24)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
