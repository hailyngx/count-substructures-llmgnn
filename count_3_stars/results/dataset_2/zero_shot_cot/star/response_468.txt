Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 5) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and the leaves connected to each central node. 

Let's list all 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (11, 8, 12)>
<1, (2, 4, 12)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (9, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 1, 9)>
<5, (12, 7, 14)>
<6, (8, 7, 14)>
<7, (2, 5, 10)>
<8, (11, 9, 6)>
<9, (3, 8, 13)>
<10, (12, 7, 5)>
<11, (0, 13, 8)>
<12, (1, 0, 5)>
<13, (11, 9, 14)>
<14, (6, 5, 13)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [14].
