Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 6) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 12) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 7) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 7) (6, 20) (2, 25) (2, 8) (2, 28) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 20) (17, 8) (17, 29) (17, 1) (29, 17) (29, 21) (22, 4) (1, 15) (1, 25) (1, 17) (1, 23) (1, 12) (21, 3) (21, 25) (21, 6) (21, 29) (7, 9) (7, 6) (26, 28) (26, 18) (28, 9) (28, 2) (28, 26) (28, 20) (16, 4) (16, 19) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 19) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 23) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 10) (4, 23) (11, 20) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 23) (23, 1) (23, 18) (23, 4) (23, 19) (24, 14) (24, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 24) (20, 6) (20, 14) (20, 28) (20, 11) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<3, (25, 21, 6)>
<15, (10, 1, 12)>
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<9, (5, 28, 14)>
<25, (3, 21, 2)>
<8, (13, 2, 17)>
<13, (5, 8, 0)>
<6, (3, 21, 7)>
<2, (25, 8, 28)>
<0, (13, 14, 20)>
<14, (9, 18, 24)>
<17, (8, 29, 1)>
<29, (17, 21, 26)>
<1, (15, 25, 17)>
<21, (3, 25, 6)>
<7, (9, 6, 26)>
<26, (28, 18, 7)>
<16, (4, 19, 10)>
<10, (15, 4, 19)>
<18, (14, 26, 23)>
<4, (22, 16, 10)>
<19, (16, 10, 23)>
<23, (1, 18, 4)>
<24, (14, 12, 24)>
<11, (20, 28, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
