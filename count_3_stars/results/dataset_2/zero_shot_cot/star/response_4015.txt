Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 18) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 1) (17, 23) (17, 2) (3, 6) (25, 6) (25, 19) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 20) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 29) (21, 20) (21, 15) (12, 7) (12, 27) (12, 0) (12, 29) (27, 12) (27, 0) (18, 14) (18, 22) (18, 8) (8, 18) (8, 5) (8, 24) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 20) (0, 12) (0, 27) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 20) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 4) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 16) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 10) (15, 5) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 28) (6, 3) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 16) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 5) (29, 4) (19, 25) (19, 11) (19, 16) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 29) (28, 2) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 21) (20, 13) (20, 1) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 24) (16, 19) (9, 2) (4, 14) (4, 13) (4, 26) (4, 6) (4, 29) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance of a 3-star.

Given the edge list, let's find the 3-stars:

1. <4, (14, 13, 26)>
2. <6, (3, 25, 4)>
3. <12, (7, 27, 0)>
4. <15, (21, 26, 5)>
5. <16, (23, 10, 24)>
6. <18, (14, 22, 8)>
7. <20, (22, 23, 13)>
8. <29, (7, 12, 5)>
9. <5, (8, 15, 29)>
10. <24, (8, 6, 16)>
11. <1, (17, 11, 20)>
12. <2, (17, 9, 28)>

There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
So, the final answer is [12].
