Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (21, 1) (21, 3) (21, 2) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 16) (22, 29) (22, 12) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (23, 24) (23, 28) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 27) (14, 25) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 6) (26, 13) (28, 18) (28, 23) (3, 21) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 24) (17, 0) (17, 13) (17, 24) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 9) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 25) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 29) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 9) (9, 11) (9, 19) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 27) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 9) (25, 4) (7, 8) (7, 24) (20, 9) (20, 4) (20, 10) (24, 23) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 29) (6, 2) (6, 4) (29, 22) (29, 16) (29, 6) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 9) (10, 20) (10, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 21) (2, 6) (2, 10) (4, 25) (4, 20) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.
From the given edges, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 1
- Node 2
- Node 3
- Node 4
- Node 5
- Node 7
- Node 10
- Node 12
- Node 13
- Node 14
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 20
- Node 23
- Node 29

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 1: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 2: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 3: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 4: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 5: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 7: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 10: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 12: One 3-star can be formed: <12, (22, 16, 25)>.
- For Node 13: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 14: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 15: One 3-star can be formed: <15, (1, 8, 24)>.
- For Node 16: One 3-star can be formed: <16, (22, 12, 29)>.
- For Node 20: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 23: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.
- For Node 29: No 3-star can be formed since it has only two neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2] and they are <12, (22, 16, 25)> and <15, (1, 8, 24)>.
