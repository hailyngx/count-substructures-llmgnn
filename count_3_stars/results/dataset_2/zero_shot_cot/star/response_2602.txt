Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's first list out all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<9, (8, 7, 0)>
<9, (2, 0, 3)>
<4, (0, 3, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (9, 7, 0)>
<6, (5, 7, 1)>
<2, (9, 0, 0)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars, which is 15 in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
