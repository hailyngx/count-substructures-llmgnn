Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 29) (13, 7) (22, 13) (9, 26) (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 3) (26, 0) (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 11) (17, 7) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 21) (21, 7) (0, 26) (0, 25) (0, 24) (25, 0) (25, 6) (25, 19) (25, 2) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 15) (12, 1) (27, 14) (27, 12) (27, 1) (27, 6) (2, 26) (2, 25) (8, 19) (8, 20) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 8) (19, 16) (5, 23) (5, 11) (5, 24) (16, 19) (16, 15) (16, 6) (11, 17) (11, 5) (18, 10) (18, 3) (18, 29) (1, 12) (1, 27) (1, 29) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 1) (29, 23) (29, 15) (3, 26) (3, 18) (23, 9) (23, 5) (23, 29) (6, 25) (6, 27) (6, 16) (6, 10) (10, 18) (10, 6) (10, 28) (24, 0) (24, 5) (24, 28) (20, 14) (20, 8) (20, 4) (28, 10) (28, 24) (28, 4) (4, 20) (4, 28) (15, 12) (15, 16) (15, 29) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them, forming a 3-star structure. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 13 has edges to nodes 22, 12, and 29, forming a 3-star. <13, (22, 12, 29)>
2. Node 7 has edges to nodes 13, 17, and 21, forming a 3-star. <7, (13, 17, 21)>
3. Node 26 has edges to nodes 9, 2, and 3, forming a 3-star. <26, (9, 2, 3)>
4. Node 17 has edges to nodes 14, 11, and 7, forming a 3-star. <17, (14, 11, 7)>
5. Node 0 has edges to nodes 26, 25, and 24, forming a 3-star. <0, (26, 25, 24)>
6. Node 27 has edges to nodes 14, 12, and 1, forming a 3-star. <27, (14, 12, 1)>
7. Node 19 has edges to nodes 9, 25, and 8, forming a 3-star. <19, (9, 25, 8)>
8. Node 5 has edges to nodes 23, 11, and 24, forming a 3-star. <5, (23, 11, 24)>
9. Node 18 has edges to nodes 10, 3, and 29, forming a 3-star. <18, (10, 3, 29)>
10. Node 1 has edges to nodes 12, 27, and 29, forming a 3-star. <1, (12, 27, 29)>
11. Node 6 has edges to nodes 25, 27, and 16, forming a 3-star. <6, (25, 27, 16)>
12. Node 10 has edges to nodes 18, 6, and 28, forming a 3-star. <10, (18, 6, 28)>
13. Node 20 has edges to nodes 14, 8, and 4, forming a 3-star. <20, (14, 8, 4)>
14. Node 15 has edges to nodes 12, 16, and 29, forming a 3-star. <15, (12, 16, 29)>
15. Node 21 has edges to nodes 7, forming a 3-star. <21, (7, , )>
16. Node 3 has edges to nodes 26, 18, forming a 3-star. <3, (26, 18, )>
17. Node 16 has edges to nodes 19, 15, and 6, forming a 3-star. <16, (19, 15, 6)>
18. Node 24 has edges to nodes 0, 5, and 28, forming a 3-star. <24, (0, 5, 28)>
19. Node 28 has edges to nodes 10, 24, and 4, forming a 3-star. <28, (10, 24, 4)>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
