Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3 and the leaves must be connected only to the central node. 
Let's find the central nodes first by finding nodes with degree 3. 

Nodes with degree 3: 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 3

Possible 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 3)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<8, (4, 2, 1)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>

So, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
