Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have a degree of 5, which means none of them can be a center of a 3-star.

Nodes 1, 3, and 4 have a degree of 4, which means they also cannot be centers of a 3-star.

Node 9 has a degree of 2, indicating it also cannot be a center.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
