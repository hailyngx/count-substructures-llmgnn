Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 14) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 20) (10, 19) (10, 24) (10, 5) (19, 10) (19, 29) (19, 1) (26, 13) (26, 17) (13, 16) (13, 26) (13, 21) (8, 16) (8, 17) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 12) (23, 11) (23, 7) (21, 13) (21, 4) (21, 22) (4, 9) (4, 21) (4, 25) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 6) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 20) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 15) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 24) (7, 23) (7, 3) (7, 27) (7, 17) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 0) (0, 5) (20, 16) (20, 3) (20, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 20) (2, 25) (2, 15) (29, 19) (15, 28) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 22) (22, 21) (22, 5) (22, 15) (27, 7) (25, 4) (25, 2) (25, 18) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 24) (17, 18) (24, 10) (24, 14) (24, 17) (18, 12) (18, 25) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges originating from them. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 9 has edges to nodes 4, 2, and 28.
- Node 16 has edges to nodes 11, 13, and 14.
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 10, 22, and 15.
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 16, 17, and 14.
- Node 2 has edges to nodes 9, 6, and 25.
- Node 25 has edges to nodes 4, 2, and 18.
- Node 24 has edges to nodes 10, 14, and 17.
- Node 1 has edges to nodes 19, 6, and 14.

Now, let's form the 3-stars by taking each of these nodes as the center and identifying the nodes connected to them. 

The final count of 3-stars is [7], and they are as follows:
<9, (4, 2, 28)>
<16, (11, 13, 14)>
<5, (10, 22, 15)>
<8, (16, 17, 14)>
<2, (9, 6, 25)>
<25, (4, 2, 18)>
<24, (10, 14, 17)>
