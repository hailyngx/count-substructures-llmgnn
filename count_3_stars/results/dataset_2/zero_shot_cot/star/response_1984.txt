Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 3) (4, 7) (4, 27) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 29) (8, 13) (8, 28) (8, 15) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 29) (13, 6) (23, 26) (23, 9) (12, 7) (12, 24) (12, 25) (17, 19) (29, 22) (29, 13) (29, 5) (26, 4) (26, 23) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 15) (6, 13) (6, 21) (6, 10) (21, 6) (21, 25) (27, 11) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 3) (10, 6) (10, 27) (10, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 20) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 25) (0, 10) (0, 25) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 23) (5, 29) (5, 0) (3, 16) (3, 27) (3, 14) (24, 18) (24, 12) (24, 2) (24, 20) (1, 2) (2, 28) (2, 24) (2, 1) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 28) (25, 13) (25, 12) (25, 21) (25, 19) (25, 0) (20, 14) (20, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify which nodes can act as the center of a 3-star. These nodes should have exactly three edges, connecting them to three other nodes.

The nodes with three edges are:
- Node 16
- Node 7
- Node 18
- Node 29
- Node 6
- Node 10
- Node 14
- Node 0
- Node 24
- Node 2

Now, we will list the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<16, (11, 3, 27)>
<7, (4, 12, 15)>
<18, (22, 19, 9)>
<29, (5, 13, 22)>
<6, (13, 21, 10)>
<10, (27, 0, 6)>
<14, (11, 3, 20)>
<0, (10, 25, 5)>
<24, (18, 2, 20)>
<2, (28, 24, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
