Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 13) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (8, 19) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 15) (13, 10) (13, 17) (19, 8) (19, 16) (19, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 18) (16, 2) (6, 10) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 12) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 14) (12, 19) (12, 5) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 17) (18, 16) (18, 12) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the center of a 3-star. This node must be connected to exactly 3 other nodes in the graph. So, we need to find nodes that have exactly 3 edges incident on them.

Nodes with 3 incident edges: 4, 7, 1, 3, 10, 13, 19, 16, 6, 11, 2, 5, 12, 18, 9

Now, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star with their neighbors.

1. Node 4: (4, 11), (4, 17), (17, 4) - <4, (11, 17)> 
2. Node 7: (7, 11), (7, 2), (7, 9) - <7, (11, 2, 9)>
3. Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 18), (3, 1) - <1, (3, 18)>
4. Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 16), (16, 3) - <3, (1, 16)>
5. Node 10: (10, 17), (10, 6), (10, 13) - <10, (17, 6, 13)>
6. Node 13: (13, 10), (13, 17), (17, 13) - <13, (10, 17)>
7. Node 19: (19, 8), (19, 16), (19, 12) - <19, (8, 16, 12)>
8. Node 16: (16, 3), (16, 0), (16, 19) - <16, (3, 0, 19)>
9. Node 6: (6, 10), (6, 18), (6, 13) - <6, (10, 18, 13)>
10. Node 11: (11, 4), (11, 7), (11, 5) - <11, (4, 7, 5)>
11. Node 2: (2, 7), (2, 16), (2, 11) - <2, (7, 16, 11)>
12. Node 5: (5, 11), (5, 2), (5, 12) - <5, (11, 2, 12)>
13. Node 12: (12, 19), (12, 5), (12, 18) - <12, (19, 5, 18)>
14. Node 18: (18, 1), (18, 17), (18, 16) - <18, (1, 17, 16)>
15. Node 9: (9, 7), (9, 0), (9, 14) - <9, (7, 0, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
