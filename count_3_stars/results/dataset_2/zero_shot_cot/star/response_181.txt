Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars present in the graph:
<4, (7, 8, 1)>
<4, (3, 2, 1)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (7, 9, 3)>
<6, (2, 3, 0)>
<9, (7, 6, 2)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 0)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<5, (8, 2, 0)>
<0, (6, 1, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
