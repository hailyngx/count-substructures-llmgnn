Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 16) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (10, 3) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 15) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 19) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 19) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 18) (2, 4) (2, 17) (19, 0) (19, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 18) (14, 13) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking through the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- <0, (12, 11, 19)>
- <1, (5, 11, 17)>
- <2, (4, 17, 11)>
- <3, (10, 6, 18)>
- <4, (2, 7, 17)>
- <5, (1, 9, 12)>
- <6, (3, 17, 19)>
- <7, (4, 12, 16)>
- <8, (13, 16, 4)>
- <9, (1, 15, 17)>
- <10, (3, 6, 18)>
- <11, (0, 12, 17)>
- <12, (0, 5, 7)>
- <13, (8, 14, 16)>
- <14, (13, 16, 9)>
- <15, (9, 15, 18)>
- <16, (7, 8, 15)>
- <17, (4, 6, 11)>
- <18, (3, 11, 15)>
- <19, (0, 6, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
