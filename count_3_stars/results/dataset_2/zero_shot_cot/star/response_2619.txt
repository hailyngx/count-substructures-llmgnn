Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars. 

Let's first list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (5, 4, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 6)>
<3, (5, 6, 0)>
<6, (1, 3, 2)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<2, (4, 7, 6)>
<0, (5, 4, 1)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
