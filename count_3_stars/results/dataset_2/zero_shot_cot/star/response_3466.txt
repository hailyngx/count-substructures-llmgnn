Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 12) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 10, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 11.

2. Counting the unique 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 6, 11)>
- <9, (5, 10, 0)>
- <6, (5, 10, 3)>
- <2, (8, 13, 6)>
- <1, (8, 14, 11)>

3. Finally, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is represented by the number of unique 3-stars found, which is 5. Therefore, the answer is [5].
