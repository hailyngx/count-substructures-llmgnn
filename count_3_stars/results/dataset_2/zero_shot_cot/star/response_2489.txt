Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 1) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central nodes and their respective leaves. 

The possible 3-star combinations are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 13)>
<4, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (2, 4, 10)>
<8, (1, 5, 14)>
<9, (11, 13, 0)>
<10, (3, 7, 6)>
<11, (0, 9, 13)>
<12, (1, 8, 14)>
<13, (3, 4, 9)>
<14, (4, 8, 12)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
