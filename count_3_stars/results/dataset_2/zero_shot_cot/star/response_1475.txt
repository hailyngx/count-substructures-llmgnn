Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 5) (17, 2) (17, 15) (18, 4) (18, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 6) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 12) (9, 8) (9, 18) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 2) (15, 19) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 1) (12, 10) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique sets of 3 nodes connected in a star pattern around a central node.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <11, (5, 6, 15)>
2. <4, (13, 14, 18)>
3. <7, (0, 10, 11)>
4. <8, (2, 3, 14)>
5. <13, (4, 8, 19)>
6. <10, (5, 7, 12)>
7. <2, (0, 8, 17)>
8. <17, (2, 15, 15)>
9. <18, (4, 9, 9)>
10. <19, (5, 12, 15)>
11. <9, (8, 18, 18)>
12. <15, (11, 17, 19)>
13. <6, (0, 1, 11)>
14. <12, (3, 10, 19)>
15. <3, (8, 12, 14)>
16. <14, (3, 4, 19)>

Therefore, there are [16] unique 3-stars in the graph.
