Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars based on the edges provided.

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
1. <5, (9, 0, 4)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 3)>
3. <6, (9, 7, 3)>
4. <4, (5, 7, 0)>
5. <7, (9, 6, 4)>
6. <2, (5, 8, 3)>
7. <8, (7, 2, 3)>
8. <0, (5, 4, 7)>
9. <1, (4, 8, _)> *Note: Node 1 only has 2 edges, hence we exclude this from being a valid 3-star.
10. <3, (9, 6, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
