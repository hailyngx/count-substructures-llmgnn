Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) 

Response:
The key observation here is to look for nodes with three edges, as those nodes could potentially be the center of 3-stars.

After analyzing the given graph, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<4, (5, 7, 1)>
<10, (11, 6, 1)>
<11, (4, 10, 14)>
<5, (4, 7, 13)>
<1, (4, 10, 14)>
<2, (7, 5, 8)>
<3, (10, 11, 14)>
<13, (5, 2, 1)>
<9, (4, 11, 14)>
<12, (11, 0, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
