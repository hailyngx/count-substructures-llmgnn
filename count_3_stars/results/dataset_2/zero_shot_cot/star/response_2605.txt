Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by counting the number of nodes that can be the center of a 3-star. In this case, each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes forms a 3-star.

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:
- Node 9: (3, 2, 7)
- Node 4: (7, 8, 6)
- Node 7: (9, 4, 6)
- Node 1: (7, 3, 6)
- Node 3: (1, 2, 8)
- Node 8: (9, 3, 6)
- Node 6: (4, 7, 8)
- Node 2: (9, 3, 4)
- Node 0: (9, 6, -)

Since Node 0 is not connected to exactly three other nodes, it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8] <9, (3, 2, 7)> <4, (7, 8, 6)> <7, (9, 4, 6)> <1, (7, 3, 6)> <3, (1, 2, 8)> <8, (9, 3, 6)> <6, (4, 7, 8)> <2, (9, 3, 4)>.
