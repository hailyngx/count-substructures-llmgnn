Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0 is connected to: 9, 7, 1, 3, 8, 6
Node 1 is connected to: 4, 3, 6, 0
Node 2 is connected to: 9
Node 3 is connected to: 7, 1, 0, 6
Node 4 is connected to: 7, 8, 1, 6
Node 5 is connected to: 9, 6, 7
Node 6 is connected to: 5, 4, 1, 3, 8, 0
Node 7 is connected to: 5, 9, 4, 0, 3
Node 8 is connected to: 4, 0, 6
Node 9 is connected to: 5, 2, 7, 0

Based on the connections, we can observe that there are 4 potential 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (9, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 3, 6)>
<3, (7, 1, 0)>
<6, (5, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
