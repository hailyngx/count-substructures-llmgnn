Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique occurrences of a central node with exactly three connected nodes forming a 3-star.

From the given edges, we can deduce the following 3-stars:
<6, (5, 1, 8)>
<9, (8, 4, 3)>
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (6, 3, 7)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
