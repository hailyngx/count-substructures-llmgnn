Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars. 
Nodes with 3 connections: 5, 9, 3, 6, 1, 8, 7, 2, 4, 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Center node: 5
   Leaves: 9, 6, 2
<5, (9, 6, 2)>

2. Center node: 9
   Leaves: 5, 4, 3
<9, (5, 4, 3)>

3. Center node: 3
   Leaves: 5, 9, 7
<3, (5, 9, 7)>

4. Center node: 6
   Leaves: 5, 1, 7
<6, (5, 1, 7)>

5. Center node: 1
   Leaves: 6, 2, 8
<1, (6, 2, 8)>

6. Center node: 8
   Leaves: 1, 3, 7
<8, (1, 3, 7)>

7. Center node: 7
   Leaves: 9, 3, 6
<7, (9, 3, 6)>

8. Center node: 2
   Leaves: 5, 1, 4
<2, (5, 1, 4)>

9. Center node: 4
   Leaves: 9, 5, 0
<4, (9, 5, 0)>

10. Center node: 0
    Leaves: 8, 2, 4
<0, (8, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: 10

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
