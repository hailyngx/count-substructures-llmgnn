Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars by looking for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

The total number of unique 3-stars found in this graph is 3.

The 3-stars are as follows: 
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (1, 0, 3)>
<4, (2, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
