Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to 3 other nodes, forming potential 3-stars.
Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following nodes that have 3 connections:
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 0)
- Node 9: (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0)
- Node 4: (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 2)
- Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 3), (7, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 3)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 0)
- Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 2)
- Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 3)
- Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 6), (3, 2)
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 2)

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- <5, (6, 1, 0)>
- <9, (2, 7, 0)>
- <4, (8, 3, 6)>
- <4, (8, 7, 3)>
- <6, (5, 4, 3)>
- <6, (5, 4, 2)>
- <6, (5, 3, 0)>
- <0, (5, 9, 6)>
- <2, (9, 4, 6)>
- <2, (9, 6, 0)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (7, 8, 6)>
