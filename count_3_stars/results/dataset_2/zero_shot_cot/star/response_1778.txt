Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 0) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

From the edge list provided, we can see that node 5, node 9, and node 10 satisfy the conditions of being central nodes in a 3-star.

Now, we need to find the leaves connected to each central node to form unique 3-stars.

1. For central node 5: (5, 6), (5, 8), (5, 1) form a 3-star. <5, (6, 8, 1)>

2. For central node 9: (9, 11), (9, 3), (9, 7) form a 3-star. <9, (11, 3, 7)>

3. For central node 10: (10, 8), (10, 13), (10, 11) form a 3-star. <10, (8, 13, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
