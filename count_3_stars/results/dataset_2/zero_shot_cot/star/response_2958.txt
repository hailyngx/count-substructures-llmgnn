Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all sets of 3-stars.

1. Let's list the sets of 3-stars based on the available edges:
<0, (7, 1, 8)>
<1, (7, 6, 5)>
<2, (7, 9, 0)>

2. Now let's count the total number of 3-stars. Each set represents a unique 3-star in the graph:
