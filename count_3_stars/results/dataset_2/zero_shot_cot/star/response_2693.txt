Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 since it is the center of the 3-stars. 

The nodes connected to node 5 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 0.

Now, we can check which of these nodes are also connected to each other. This will help us find the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 3.
2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 1, and 8.
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 0, and 6.
5. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 7, 6, and 8.

Now, we can form the unique 3-stars:
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 3)>
<5, (3, 9, 1)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (0, 6, 4)>
<5, (0, 8, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
