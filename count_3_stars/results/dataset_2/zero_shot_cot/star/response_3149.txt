Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (7, 14) (7, 18) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 19) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 18) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (9, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 18) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 1) (11, 8) (11, 17) (12, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by locating central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting with the list of edges, we can determine the 3-stars using the definition provided:

We will consider each node in the graph to see if it is a central node of a 3-star. 

Let's start with the node 0:
(0, 2), (0, 17), (0, 3), (0, 1) - Node 0 is not a central node of a 3-star.

Next, node 1:
(1, 0), (1, 9), (1, 14), (1, 18) - Node 1 is not a central node of a 3-star.

Continue this process for each node in the graph to identify all possible 3-stars.

After checking all nodes, the list of unique 3-stars found is:
<2, (4, 8, 16)>
<2, (3, 0, 17)>
<5, (8, 13, 15)>
<5, (14, 7, 1)>
<13, (6, 16, 17)>
<13, (5, 6, 17)>
<16, (10, 2, 13)>
<16, (3, 13, 10)>
<17, (0, 15, 13)>
<17, (11, 8, 13)>
<1, (14, 18, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(10)].
