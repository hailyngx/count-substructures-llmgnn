Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 15) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (19, 4) (19, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 7) (4, 19) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 14) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 16) (7, 2) (7, 17) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 11) (15, 8) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 19) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 18) (16, 3) (16, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected in a star pattern. 
Let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 2: <2, (1, 7, 8)>
2. Node 5: <5, (3, 13, 17)>
3. Node 13: <13, (9, 12, 17)>
4. Node 4: <4, (0, 12, 19)>
5. Node 6: <6, (12, 14, 0)>
6. Node 9: <9, (7, 11, 13)>
7. Node 10: <10, (14, 18, 19)>
8. Node 14: <14, (10, 11, 18)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
