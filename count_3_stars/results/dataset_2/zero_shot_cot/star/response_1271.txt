Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 16) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (2, 10) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 8) (11, 0) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (16, 5) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 9) (19, 17) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify them as follows:
1. From node 3: (3, 15), (3, 17), (3, 6) - <3, (15, 17, 6)>
2. From node 15: (15, 3), (15, 4) - <15, (3, 4)>
3. From node 5: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 18) - <5, (9, 13, 18)>
4. From node 9: (9, 5), (9, 17), (9, 10) - <9, (5, 17, 10)>
5. From node 4: (4, 15), (4, 0) - <4, (15, 0)>
6. From node 7: (7, 10), (7, 18), (7, 13) - <7, (10, 18, 13)>
7. From node 2: (2, 10) - <2, (10)>
8. From node 8: (8, 16), (8, 11), (8, 18) - <8, (16, 11, 18)>
9. From node 0: (0, 4), (0, 16), (0, 11) - <0, (4, 16, 11)>
10. From node 13: (13, 5), (13, 9), (13, 7) - <13, (5, 9, 7)>
11. From node 1: (1, 17), (1, 12), (1, 18) - <1, (17, 12, 18)>
12. From node 17: (17, 3), (17, 9), (17, 1), (17, 6), (17, 19) - <17, (3, 9, 1)>
13. From node 11: (11, 8), (11, 0) - <11, (8, 0)>
14. From node 10: (10, 9), (10, 7), (10, 2) - <10, (9, 7, 2)>
15. From node 16: (16, 5), (16, 4), (16, 8), (16, 0) - <16, (5, 4, 8)>
16. From node 6: (6, 3), (6, 17), (6, 12) - <6, (3, 17, 12)>
17. From node 19: (19, 9), (19, 17) - <19, (9, 17)>
18. From node 12: (12, 3), (12, 1), (12, 6) - <12, (3, 1, 6)>
19. From node 18: (18, 5), (18, 7), (18, 8), (18, 1) - <18, (5, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is therefore [19].
