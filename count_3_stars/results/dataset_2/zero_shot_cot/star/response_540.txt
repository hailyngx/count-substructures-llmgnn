Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 17) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 17) (11, 15) (8, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (6, 17) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 10) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 1) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 14) (16, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 16) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 6) (2, 14) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 12) (18, 13) (18, 12) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) 

Response:
First, I will identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern. Nodes with exactly 3 edges are potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes with exactly 3 edges are:
- Node 2 (connected to 1, 14, 16)
- Node 6 (connected to 3, 17, 6)
- Node 8 (connected to 15, 8, 11)

Next, I will determine the 3-stars based on the potential centers identified.

For Node 2:
- Node 2 is not a center of any 3-star since it has more than 3 neighbors.

For Node 6:
- Node 6 forms a 3-star <6, (3, 17, 6)>.

For Node 8:
- Node 8 is not a center of any 3-star since it has fewer than 3 neighbors.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found is <6, (3, 17, 6)>.
