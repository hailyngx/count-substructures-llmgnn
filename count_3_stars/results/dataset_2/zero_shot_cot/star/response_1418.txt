Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 23) (2, 16) (2, 28) (29, 25) (29, 23) (29, 4) (1, 3) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 20) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 13) (21, 27) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 15) (0, 8) (20, 9) (20, 11) (20, 0) (26, 1) (26, 7) (26, 17) (28, 2) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 21) (13, 24) (24, 13) (24, 7) (19, 5) (19, 3) (15, 0) (7, 26) (7, 24) (7, 16) (7, 17) (25, 29) (25, 12) (23, 9) (23, 29) (23, 11) (23, 27) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 7) (16, 22) (6, 17) (6, 18) (4, 29) (4, 1) (4, 22) (22, 5) (22, 16) (22, 4) (8, 0) (8, 28) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 27) (18, 6) (18, 12) (14, 27) (27, 21) (27, 23) (27, 17) (27, 14) (12, 3) (12, 25) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to the central node of a 3-star:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 19, 22, and 16.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 20, 13, and 23.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 21, and 24.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 1, 28, 13, and 27.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 21, 26, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 29, 1, and 22.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 17.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 2, 21, 0, and 8.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 21, 23, 17, and 14.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 26, 7, 6, and 27.

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:

- From node 5: <5, (9, 13, 19)> and <5, (9, 13, 22)>.
- From node 9: <9, (5, 13, 20)> and <9, (13, 21, 24)>.
- From node 13: <13, (5, 9, 21)> and <13, (5, 21, 24)>.
- From node 21: <21, (1, 13, 27)>.
- From node 1: <1, (3, 26, 4)>.
- From node 4: <4, (1, 22, 29)>.
- From node 26: <26, (1, 7, 17)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].<5, (9, 13, 19)>, <5, (9, 13, 22)>, <9, (5, 13, 20)>, <9, (13, 21, 24)>, <13, (5, 9, 21)>, <13, (5, 21, 24)>, <21, (1, 13, 27)>, <1, (3, 26, 4)>, <4, (1, 22, 29)>.
