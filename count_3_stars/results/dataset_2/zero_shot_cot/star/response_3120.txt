Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected in the pattern of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The potential 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (8, 5, 12)>
<2, (7, 5, 12)>
<3, (7, 4, 5)>
<4, (3, 8, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (8, 11, 14)>
<7, (3, 5, 2)>
<8, (1, 4, 13)>
<9, (3, 0, 10)>
<10, (13, 7, 14)>
<11, (8, 4, 14)>
<12, (7, 0, 2)>
<13, (8, 10, 14)>
<14, (11, 6, 10)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
