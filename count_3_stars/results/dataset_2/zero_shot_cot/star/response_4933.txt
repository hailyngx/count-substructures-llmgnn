Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph and count them:
1. <1, (3, 4, 6)>
2. <3, (0, 1, 7)>
3. <6, (0, 1, 5)>
4. <8, (0, 4, 7)>
5. <9, (1, 3, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].  
The unique 3-stars found are: <<1, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 3, 7)>>.
