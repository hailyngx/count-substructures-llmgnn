Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (18, 19) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 13) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 16) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 18) (7, 10) (7, 2) (13, 14) (13, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node as a potential central node and checking if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through each node:

1. Node 0: Not a central node of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: Not a central node of any 3-star.
3. Node 2: Not a central node of any 3-star.
4. Node 3: <3, (15, 17, 19)>
5. Node 4: <4, (15, 6, 2)>
6. Node 5: Not a central node of any 3-star.
7. Node 6: <6, (9, 12, 4)>
8. Node 7: Not a central node of any 3-star.
9. Node 8: Not a central node of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: <9, (6, 11, 1)>
11. Node 10: <10, (11, 7, 2)>
12. Node 11: <11, (9, 10, 19)>
13. Node 12: <12, (15, 6, 16)>
14. Node 13: Not a central node of any 3-star.
15. Node 14: <14, (10, 2, 13)>
16. Node 15: Not a central node of any 3-star.
17. Node 16: <16, (12, 17, 13)>
18. Node 17: Not a central node of any 3-star.
19. Node 18: Not a central node of any 3-star.
20. Node 19: <19, (11, 0, 17)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
