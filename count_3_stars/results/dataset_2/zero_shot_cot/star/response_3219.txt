Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 18) (21, 3) (21, 9) (21, 12) (15, 0) (15, 4) (27, 14) (3, 21) (3, 25) (3, 16) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 23) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 26) (17, 25) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 2) (29, 17) (29, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 26) (28, 11) (28, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 24) (26, 8) (26, 6) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 7) (11, 28) (11, 2) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 20) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (20, 5) (20, 10) (18, 1) (18, 26) (18, 5) (19, 1) (19, 3) (9, 21) (9, 25) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 16) (12, 21) (12, 14) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 7) (24, 23) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 24) (16, 2) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 26) (7, 24) (0, 15) (0, 22) (0, 13) (0, 9) (23, 25) (23, 28) (23, 24) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 20) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<3, (21, 25, 19)>
<5, (29, 13, 20)>
<6, (17, 14, 26)>
<9, (21, 25, 8)>
<10, (1, 13, 20)>
<14, (27, 6, 2)>
<16, (3, 9, 24)>
<18, (1, 5, 26)>
<24, (22, 16, 23)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
