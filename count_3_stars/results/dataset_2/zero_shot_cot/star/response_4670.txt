After identifying the connections, we can now count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

There are a total of [42] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (28, 14, 20)>
<2, (26, 3, 14)>
<4, (22, 18, 12)>
<7, (11, 3, 25)>
<8, (25, 1, 19)>
<9, (24, 26, 23)>
<10, (1, 12, 10)>
<11, (24, 13, 7)>
<16, (0, 29, 16)>
<17, (12, 6, 17)>
