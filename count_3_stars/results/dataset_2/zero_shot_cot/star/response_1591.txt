Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
To solve this problem, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Number of 3-stars = 3 * Number of triangles in the graph

To find the number of triangles in the graph, we can count the number of triangles formed by three nodes that are connected to each other. Let's find all such triangles:

Triangles:
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<4, 6, 3>
<9, 6, 4>
<9, 6, 3>

Count of triangles = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is:
Number of 3-stars = 3 * 7 = 21

So, the final answer is [21].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, 7, 5>
<1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 8>
<2, 3, 7>
<4, 6, 3>
<9, 6, 4>
