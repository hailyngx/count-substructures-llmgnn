Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (1, 10) (1, 6) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 16) (3, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (19, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 9) (16, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<1, (6, 10, 18)>
<5, (2, 11, 16)>
<6, (1, 4, 17)>
<10, (1, 8, 18)>
<11, (2, 5, 10)>
<12, (3, 9, 13)>
<13, (12, 15, 9)>
<15, (2, 4, 7)>
<16, (5, 9, 14)>
<17, (6, 7, 18)>
<18, (10, 17, 3)>
<19, (2, 4, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
