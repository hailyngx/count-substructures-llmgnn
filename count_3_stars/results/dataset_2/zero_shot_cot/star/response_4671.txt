Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (6, 13, 2)>
<9, (2, 7, 12)>
<4, (7, 12, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (7, 3, 11)>
<3, (1, 0, 2)>
<8, (11, 6, 14)>
<13, (5, 12, 14)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 9, 3)>
<11, (1, 8, 12)>
<12, (9, 4, 13)>
<0, (4, 1, 3)>
<10, (5, 4, 7)>
<14, (13, 6, 2)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
