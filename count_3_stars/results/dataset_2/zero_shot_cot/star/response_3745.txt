1. From node 0: (0, 8, 24), (0, 20, 27), (0, 15, 1), (0, 15, 4), (0, 15, 12), (0, 6, 21)
2. From node 1: (1, 15, 0), (1, 15, 4), (1, 27, 5)
3. From node 2: (2, 17, 18), (2, 4, 26)
4. From node 3: (3, 17, 6)
5. From node 4: (4, 2, 26), (4, 1, 5), (4, 12, 23)
6. From node 5: (5, 4, 1), (5, 27, 20), (5, 10, 14)
7. From node 6: (6, 0, 21), (6, 21, 7), (6, 3, 17)
8. From node 7: (7, 14, 10), (7, 21, 6), (7, 29, 19)
9. From node 8: (8, 24, 28)
10. From node 9: (9, 21, 25), (9, 25, 20), (9, 19, 29)
11. From node 10: (10, 14, 5)
12. From node 11: (11, 13, 22)
13. From node 12: (12, 15, 4), (12, 23, 24), (12, 13, 15)
14. From node 13: (13, 12, 15)
15. From node 14: (14, 23, 12), (14, 10, 7)
16. From node 15: (15, 0, 1), (15, 0, 4), (15, 0, 12), (15, 1, 27), (15, 4, 12), (15, 24, 23)
17. From node 16: (16, 2, 28), (16, 4, 24), (16, 24, 23)
18. From node 17: (17, 2, 18), (17, 3, 6)

23. From node 22: (22, 16, 11)
24. From node 23: (23, 12, 24)
25. From node 24: (24, 8, 16)
26. From node 25: (25, 20, 9)
27. From node 26: (26, 4, 2)
28. From node 27: (27, 1, 5)
29. From node 28: (28, 16, 24)
30. From node 29: (29, 7, 19)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30]. The unique 3-stars are:
