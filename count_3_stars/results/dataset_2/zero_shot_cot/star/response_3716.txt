Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 2) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (13, 6) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all possible 3-stars in the given graph based on the definition provided. 

From the edge list, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <5, (9, 8, 4)>
2. <9, (5, 10, 12)>
3. <10, (9, 3, 4)>
4. <4, (5, 8, 12)>
5. <12, (9, 6, 4)>
6. <6, (12, 0, 13)>
7. <0, (6, 1, 4)>
8. <1, (3, 11, 14)>
9. <3, (1, 10, 4)>
10. <11, (5, 1, 3)>
11. <8, (5, 3, 4)>
12. <7, (0, 10, 2)>
13. <14, (5, 1, 2)>
14. <13, (6, 2, 0)>
15. <2, (7, 12, 14)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is 15. 

Thus, the final answer is [15].
