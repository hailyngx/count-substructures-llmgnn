Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential central nodes of a 3-star.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 5, and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 9, 6, and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 1.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 1.

Next, let's list down the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 9, 6)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (9, 3, 1)>

Now, count the number of 3-stars: [6].
