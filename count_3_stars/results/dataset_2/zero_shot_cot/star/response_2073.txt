Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central nodes and their connected nodes.

First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph:

- Node 0 has degree 6.
- Node 4 has degree 5.
- Node 6 has degree 5.
- Node 8 has degree 5.
- Node 13 has degree 7.
- Node 14 has degree 5.

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

- <0, (8, 6, 7)>
- <4, (5, 9, 13)>
- <6, (5, 0, 1)>
- <8, (13, 4, 11)>
- <13, (9, 8, 12)>
- <14, (5, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
