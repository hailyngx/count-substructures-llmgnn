Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 0) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
The central nodes with exactly three leaves are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13.

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:

1: (0, 7, 13)
1: (3, 11, 1)
1: (5, 13, 0)
1: (7, 0, 1)
1: (13, 1, 8)
1: (13, 5, 0)
3: (1, 11, 3)
3: (3, 14, 9)
3: (11, 1, 12)
3: (13, 10, 14)

There are a total of <1, (0, 7, 13)>, <1, (3, 11, 1)>, <1, (5, 13, 0)>, <1, (7, 0, 1)>, <1, (13, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 11, 3)>, <3, (3, 14, 9)>, <3, (11, 1, 12)>, and <3, (13, 10, 14)>.

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
