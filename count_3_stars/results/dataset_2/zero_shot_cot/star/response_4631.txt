Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 6) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (19, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (9, 17) (9, 2) (9, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes and check for 3-stars:

1. Node 0:
<0, (18, 16, 6)>

2. Node 1:
<1, (5, 6, 11)>

3. Node 2:
<2, (18, 9, 11)>

4. Node 3:
<3, (14, 10, 13)>
<3, (10, 6, 13)>
<3, (14, 10, 6)>

5. Node 4:
<4, (7, 16, 17)>

6. Node 5:
<5, (8, 1, 6)>

7. Node 6:
<6, (10, 0, 1)>
<6, (15, 1, 5)>
<6, (15, 0, 10)>
<6, (15, 1, 10)>

8. Node 7:
<7, (4, 12, 17)>

9. Node 8:
<8, (16, 11, 5)>

10. Node 9:
<9, (17, 2, 16)>

11. Node 10:
<10, (3, 12, 6)>
<10, (3, 6, 13)>
<10, (12, 7, 6)>

12. Node 11:
<11, (8, 1, 2)>

13. Node 12:
<12, (7, 10, 6)>

14. Node 13:
<13, (3, 15, 10)>

15. Node 14:
<14, (17, 3, 6)>

16. Node 15:
<15, (2, 6, 13)>

17. Node 16:
<16, (8, 4, 0)>
<16, (19, 4, 9)>

18. Node 17:
<17, (4, 7, 9)>
<17, (14, 17, 9)>

19. Node 18:
<18, (8, 2, 0)>

20. Node 19:
<19, (16, 4, 9)>

There are a total of [21] 3-stars in the graph.
