Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 15) (9, 2) (9, 19) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 4) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 14) (1, 17) (15, 5) (15, 6) (15, 16) (12, 6) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (16, 13) (18, 5) (18, 11) (18, 19) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (7, 8) (7, 3) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 0) (13, 16) (13, 19) (13, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
These are: 
<14, (11, 1, 17)>
<16, (15, 0, 13)>
<5, (18, 6, 15)>
<4, (10, 8, 6)>
<3, (19, 7, 14)>
<2, (9, 13, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
