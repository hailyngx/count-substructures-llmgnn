Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are central nodes in the 3-star graphs. Since a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we will look for nodes with degree 3 in the graph.

Nodes with degree 3:  
Node 5, Node 6, Node 4, Node 0, Node 2

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<5, (9, 3, 1)>
<5, (9, 6, 3)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 2)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
