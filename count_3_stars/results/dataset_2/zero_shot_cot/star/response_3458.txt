Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <5, (1, 3, 4)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 5: <9, (2, 4, 5)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, and 7: <4, (0, 5, 7)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8: <7, (2, 4, 8)>
5. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 5: <3, (1, 2, 5)>
6. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 3: <8, (0, 1, 3)>
7. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 7: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
8. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 3: <6, (0, 2, 3)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found a total of 8 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
