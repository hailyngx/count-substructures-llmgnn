Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 15) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 13) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 12) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 8) (12, 18) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 16) (19, 10) (19, 15) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 17) (3, 13) (5, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 15) (16, 9) (13, 10) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of ways to select a center node and then selecting 3 leaves from the remaining nodes connected to the center node.

In this graph, the node with the most incident edges is node 0 with 5 edges incident to it. This makes node 0 the center node for all potential 3-stars.

Therefore, to count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
1. Choose node 0 as the center node.
2. Select 3 leaves from the nodes adjacent to node 0 (nodes 7, 12, 15).

The number of ways to choose 3 leaves from 3 adjacent nodes is the combination of 3 items taken from 3, which is 1.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].

The unique 3-star in this graph is: <<0, (7, 12, 15)>>.
