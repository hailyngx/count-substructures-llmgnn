Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 5: <5, (9, 4, 0)>, <5, (9, 3, 0)>, <5, (4, 9, 3)>
- From node 9: <9, (5, 4, 0)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <9, (4, 5, 0)>
- From node 4: <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>
- From node 3: <3, (5, 7, 1)>, <3, (5, 7, 6)>, <3, (5, 1, 2)>
- From node 8: <8, (4, 1, 2)>, <8, (4, 1, 0)>, <8, (4, 2, 0)>
- From node 2: <2, (4, 1, 3)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 3, 6)>
- From node 0: <0, (5, 9, 8)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>, <0, (5, 8, 2)>
- From node 6: <6, (1, 3, 2)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [15].
