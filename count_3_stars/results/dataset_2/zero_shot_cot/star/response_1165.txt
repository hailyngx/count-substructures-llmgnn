Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 5, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 6, and 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 5, and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 2, and 1.

2. Count the total number of 3-stars:
- The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (6, 5, 3)>
<1, (6, 9, 8)>
<2, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (7, 6, 0)>
<4, (7, 5, 1)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<6, (9, 8, 1)>
