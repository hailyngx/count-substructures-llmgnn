Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 10) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by finding nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first list the unique 3-stars in this graph:
<5, (9, 2, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<1, (9, 14, 12)>
<14, (1, 10, 12)>
<4, (5, 8, 10)>
<8, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<0, (5, 10, 6)>
<7, (9, 11, 13)>
<12, (1, 14, 6)>
<10, (4, 0, 13)>
<6, (12, 0, 11)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique 3-stars:
