Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<6, (1, 2, 12)>
<9, (7, 13, 11)>
<10, (4, 7, 11)>
<11, (4, 10, 13)>
<12, (6, 10, 2)>

Now count the total number of unique 3-stars: 6

Therefore, the answer is [6].
