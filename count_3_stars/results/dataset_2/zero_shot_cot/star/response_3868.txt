Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 4) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (19, 1) (19, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 2) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 9) (8, 1) (8, 18) (7, 15) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, let's look for the 3-star configurations in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves connected to it.

Now, let's identify the nodes that can act as centers for a 3-star. These nodes have exactly 3 edges connected to them. 

The nodes that satisfy this condition are: 1, 3, 5, 6, 13, 15, 4, 12, 11, 19, 16, 2, 8, 7, 9, and 18. 

Next, we will list all possible unique 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 2, 19)>
<3, (1, 5, 4)>
<5, (3, 6, 18)>
<6, (5, 13, 0)>
<13, (5, 15, 18)>
<15, (13, 7, 4)>
<4, (3, 12, 15)>
<12, (14, 4, 0)>
<11, (14, 19, 9)>
<19, (1, 11, 16)>
<16, (17, 3, 2)>
<2, (1, 16, 9)>
<8, (1, 18, 0)>
<7, (15, 0, 0)>
<9, (11, 2, 0)>
<18, (5, 13, 8)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [16].
