Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 2) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's locate the 3-star graphs in the given graph based on the definition provided. Each 3-star consists of one central node and three leaves.

From the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- 3-star with node 1 as the central node and nodes 6, 7, and 8 as leaves: <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- 3-star with node 2 as the central node and nodes 6, 7, and 9 as leaves: <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- 3-star with node 3 as the central node and nodes 4, 5, and 11 as leaves: <3, (4, 5, 11)>
- 3-star with node 4 as the central node and nodes 0, 11, and 12 as leaves: <4, (0, 11, 12)>
- 3-star with node 5 as the central node and nodes 3, 11, and 14 as leaves: <5, (3, 11, 14)>
- 3-star with node 8 as the central node and nodes 0, 1, and 13 as leaves: <8, (0, 1, 13)>
- 3-star with node 9 as the central node and nodes 1, 13, and 2 as leaves: <9, (1, 13, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars identified: [7].
