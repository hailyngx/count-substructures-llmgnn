Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 8) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The total number of 3-stars can be found by counting the number of nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them and also counting the possible 3-stars that can be formed around those nodes.

From the given graph, the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are: 1, 2, 7, 8, 11, and 14.

Now, let's list the possible 3-stars:
<1, (5, 6, 10)>
<2, (0, 6, 13)>
<7, (6, 11, 14)>
<8, (1, 3, 14)>
<11, (6, 7, 14)>
<14, (7, 11, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
