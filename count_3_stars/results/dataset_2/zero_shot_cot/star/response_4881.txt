Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 8) (12, 9) (12, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 3) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars can be determined by observing nodes with exactly 3 incident edges. 
By looking at the given edges, we can identify the central nodes as 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 10, 13, and 14.
Now, let's find the leaves corresponding to each central node.

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].

Unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (5, 8, 10)>
<4, (7, 13, 0)>
<7, (4, 12, 11)>
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<3, (9, 1, 14)>
<10, (9, 3, 8)>
<13, (4, 3, 11)>
<14, (4, 7, 3)>
