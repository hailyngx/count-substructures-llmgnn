Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 11) (9, 1) (26, 19) (26, 24) (15, 20) (15, 21) (27, 21) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 8) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 20) (29, 4) (4, 29) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 25) (7, 16) (7, 22) (8, 27) (8, 16) (8, 3) (23, 17) (23, 25) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 21) (0, 1) (20, 15) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 5) (17, 23) (17, 28) (17, 12) (17, 11) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 5) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 25) (24, 26) (24, 20) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (25, 18) (28, 17) (28, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 27) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 12) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 22) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 16) (5, 20) (5, 14) (5, 3) (21, 15) (21, 27) (21, 0) (22, 27) (22, 7) (22, 16) (10, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3:
- (27, 21, 22, 6, 8, 20, 24, 5, 3) have degree 3.

2. Find all 3-stars involving the nodes with degree 3:
<27, (21, 22, 6)>
<21, (15, 27, 0)>
<22, (27, 7, 16)>
<6, (27, 2, 1)>
<8, (27, 3, 16)>
<20, (15, 24, 5)>
<24, (26, 20, 5)>
<5, (20, 14, 3)>
<3, (8, 28, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
