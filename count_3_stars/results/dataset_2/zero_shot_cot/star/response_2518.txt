Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star has degree 3, meaning it has 3 edges connected to it. Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, 0, 8)>
<8, (4, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<0, (5, 7, 1)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the graph.
