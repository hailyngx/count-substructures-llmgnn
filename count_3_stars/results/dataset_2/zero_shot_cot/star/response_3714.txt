Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 17) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 5) (8, 16) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 18) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 17) (2, 4) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 2) (0, 17) (0, 1) (0, 19) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 10) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (9, 16) (9, 4) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
2. Check if the edges form a 3-star pattern with one node as the center and the other three as leaves.

After examining the given edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<11, (16, 10, 15)>
<16, (11, 12, 17)>
<3, (15, 5, 10)>
<15, (11, 3, 17)>
<10, (11, 18, 4)>
<8, (16, 19, 6)>
<18, (10, 13, 2)>
<0, (17, 1, 19)>
<19, (10, 8, 2)>
<4, (11, 10, 2)>
<17, (16, 15, 2)>
<1, (2, 0, 7)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [12].
