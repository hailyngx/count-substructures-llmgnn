Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 7, 8 
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9 
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6 
- Node 3: 2, 5, 6, 9 
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8 
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 6, 7 
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 9 
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 5 
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 9 
- Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 8

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
There are three 3-star configurations in this graph:
1. <0, (1, 5, 8)>
2. <2, (3, 5, 6)>
3. <4, (7, 8, *)> (Note: The central node 4 has only 2 leaves in this graph, not forming a 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
