Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 

Response:
There are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's list and count them:

<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 6)>
<1, (9, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<8, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
