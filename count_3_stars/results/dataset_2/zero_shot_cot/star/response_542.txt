Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (17, 9) (17, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 14) (3, 1) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 11) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of times each node is the central node in a 3-star structure. 

Let's start by listing the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (5, 3, 6)>
<2, (18, 19, 8)>
<3, (14, 1, 4)>
<4, (13, 7, 11)>
<5, (12, 1, 0)>
<6, (16, 1, 11)>
<7, (15, 13, 8)>
<8, (14, 7, 6)>
<9, (17, 1, 0)>
<10, (0, 12, 10)>
<11, (4, 6, 8)>
<12, (18, 12, 10)>
<13, (4, 15, 7)>
<14, (9, 14, 8)>
<15, (4, 15, 7)>
<16, (7, 6, 16)>
<17, (9, 17, 1)>
<18, (2, 8, 12)>
<19, (2, 18, 8)>

There are a total of 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [19].
