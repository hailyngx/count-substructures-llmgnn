Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<0, (8, 11, 12)>
<1, (6, 14, 0)>
<2, (11, 14, 0)>
<3, (7, 11, 0)>
<4, (9, 10, 14)>
<5, (7, 8, 13)>
<6, (9, 1, 13)>
<7, (5, 3, 12)>
<8, (5, 0, 13)>
<9, (6, 4, 14)>
<10, (7, 4, 11)>
<11, (13, 2, 0)>
<12, (7, 3, 13)>
<13, (8, 11, 14)>
<14, (9, 1, 2)>

Therefore, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
