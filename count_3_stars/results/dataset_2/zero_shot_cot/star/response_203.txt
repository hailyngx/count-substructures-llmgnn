Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 8) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 15) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 13) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 1) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (13, 10) (13, 15) (11, 5) 

Response:
First, we need to find all the nodes with degree 3. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. 

Nodes with degree 3: 14, 17, 18, 12, 16, 1, 13, 15

Now, for each of these nodes, we need to find the nodes connected to them. We will check if these connections form 3-stars.

Checking for node 14:
(14, 17, 0, 9), (14, 17, 13)

Checking for node 17:
(17, 14, 1, 19), (17, 14, 5)

Checking for node 18:
(18, 2, 4, 13)

Checking for node 12:
(12, 7, 16, 9), (12, 16, 3)

Checking for node 16:
(16, 2, 12, 4), (16, 12, 1)

Checking for node 1:
(1, 17, 16, 10), (1, 17, 8)

Checking for node 13:
(13, 18, 10, 15), (13, 14, 15)

Checking for node 15:
(15, 9, 19, 13)

Counting the number of 3-stars:
[12]

Unique 3-stars:
<14, (17, 0, 9)>
<14, (17, 13)>
<17, (14, 1, 19)>
<17, (14, 5)>
<18, (2, 4, 13)>
<12, (7, 16, 9)>
<12, (16, 3)>
<16, (2, 12, 4)>
<16, (12, 1)>
<1, (17, 16, 10)>
<1, (17, 8)>
<13, (18, 10, 15)>
<13, (14, 15)>
<15, (9, 19, 13)>
