Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
