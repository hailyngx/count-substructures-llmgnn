Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, thus forming a 3-star. 

Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 0)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
