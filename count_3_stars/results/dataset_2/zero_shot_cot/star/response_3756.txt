Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 10) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 8) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, identify all nodes that have exactly three neighbors, as these nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star.

The nodes with 3 neighbors are: 4, 7, 2, 8, 0, 14

Next, for each of these nodes, list out the neighbors of the node and check if there are any 3-star configurations. A 3-star will have the center node and exactly 3 neighbors connected to it.

The 3-stars found are:
<4, (7, 9, 13)>
<6, (9, 2, 1)>
<9, (4, 6, 14)>
<12, (7, 2, 10)>
<2, (6, 8, 13)>
<8, (2, 5, 1)>
<0, (12, 14, 13)>
<14, (9, 0, 13)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
