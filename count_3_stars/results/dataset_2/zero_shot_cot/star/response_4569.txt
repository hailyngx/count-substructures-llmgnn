Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 10) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 18) (6, 13) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 18) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 2) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 4) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 19) (5, 17) (1, 18) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 8) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 11) (18, 15) (18, 17) (18, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes. 

The central nodes in a 3-star have exactly 3 edges connected to them. So, let's identify the central nodes in the graph based on this information:
- Node 11 has 3 edges connected to it: (11, 10), (11, 18), and (11, 8).
- Node 16 has 4 edges connected to it, so it is not a central node.

Therefore, we have one 3-star with the central node 11: <11, (10, 18, 8)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1]. 
So, the answer is [1].
