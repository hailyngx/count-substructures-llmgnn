Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 12) (5, 3) (5, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 10, 2)>
<9, (6, 14, 12)>
<10, (6, 1, 11)>
<2, (6, 8, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<1, (3, 0, 10)>
<8, (3, 11, 2)>
<0, (1, 7, 12)>
<7, (3, 10, 0)>
<11, (10, 14, 8)>
<12, (9, 0, 13)>
<13, (6, 7, 12)>
<14, (9, 10, 11)>
<5, (3, 8)>
<4, (6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph [14].
