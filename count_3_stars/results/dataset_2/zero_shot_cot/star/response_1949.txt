Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 11) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 2) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 1) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 14)>
<1, (4, 12, 13)>
<2, (6, 10, 14)>
<4, (1, 9, 12)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 13, 14)>
<8, (5, 6, 11)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<10, (2, 5, 12)>
<12, (4, 10, 13)>
