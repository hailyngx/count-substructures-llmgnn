Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 14) (22, 8) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 17) (23, 10) (10, 23) (10, 17) (10, 21) (17, 23) (17, 10) (17, 4) (28, 29) (28, 24) (28, 18) (28, 5) (29, 28) (29, 1) (29, 27) (29, 0) (7, 6) (7, 26) (12, 24) (12, 8) (12, 9) (3, 14) (11, 23) (11, 19) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 20) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (8, 22) (8, 12) (8, 18) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 26) (21, 4) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 9) (25, 27) (25, 14) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 6) (14, 22) (14, 3) (14, 25) (14, 26) (26, 7) (26, 21) (26, 14) (1, 29) (1, 13) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 20) (2, 0) (13, 21) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 24) (6, 7) (6, 27) (6, 15) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 21) (0, 29) (0, 1) (0, 2) (15, 6) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 8) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 13) (9, 12) (9, 16) (20, 5) (20, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes and their neighbors to determine the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Node 23 has neighbors 11, 4, and 17.
2. Node 10 has neighbors 17, 21, and 23.
3. Node 17 has neighbors 23, 4, and 10.
4. Node 28 has neighbors 29, 24, and 18.
5. Node 29 has neighbors 1, 27, and 28.
6. Node 5 has neighbors 28, 19, and 2.
7. Node 21 has neighbors 10, 16, and 13.
8. Node 14 has neighbors 22, 3, and 25.
9. Node 6 has neighbors 7, 27, and 15.
10. Node 8 has neighbors 22, 12, and 18.
11. Node 12 has neighbors 24, 8, and 9.
12. Node 26 has neighbors 7, 21, and 14.
13. Node 1 has neighbors 29, 13, and 0.
14. Node 13 has neighbors 21, 16, and 1.
15. Node 4 has neighbors 23, 17, and 19.
16. Node 29 has neighbors 0, 1, and 27.
17. Node 18 has neighbors 28, 5, and 8.
18. Node 24 has neighbors 28, 12, and 13.
19. Node 9 has neighbors 12, 16, and 0.
20. Node 20 has neighbors 5, 2, and 0.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<23, (11, 4, 17)>
<23, (4, 17, 10)>
<10, (17, 21, 23)>
<17, (23, 4, 10)>
<28, (29, 24, 18)>
<29, (1, 27, 28)>
<5, (28, 19, 2)>
<21, (10, 16, 13)>
<14, (22, 3, 25)>
<6, (7, 27, 15)>
<8, (22, 12, 18)>
<12, (24, 8, 9)>
<26, (7, 21, 14)>
<1, (29, 13, 0)>
<13, (21, 16, 1)>
<4, (23, 17, 19)>
<29, (0, 1, 27)>
<18, (28, 5, 8)>
<24, (28, 12, 13)>
<9, (12, 16, 0)>
<20, (5, 2, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
