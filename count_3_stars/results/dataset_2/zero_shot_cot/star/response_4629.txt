Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars:

1. Find nodes with degree 3. These nodes can be centers of 3-stars.
   - Node 6, 9, 3, and 4 have degree 3.

2. For each of these nodes, check if the neighboring nodes form a 3-star.
   
   For node 6:
   - Neighbors: 9, 7, 3, 0
   - 3-star: <6, (9, 7, 3)>

   For node 9:
   - Neighbors: 6, 4, 2, 7, 0
   - 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 2)>

   For node 3:
   - Neighbors: 6, 1, 4, 8
   - No 3-star.

   For node 4:
   - Neighbors: 9, 3, 8, 0, 2
   - 3-star: <4, (9, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<<6, (9, 7, 3)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <4, (9, 3, 8)>>.
