Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 13) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 10) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes connected to node 6. These are nodes 9, 7, 10, and 13.

Then, we can identify the nodes connected to node 9. These are nodes 6, 2, 11, 0, and 12.

We will now count the 3-stars in this graph.

[<6, (9, 7, 10)>, <6, (9, 7, 13)>, <6, (9, 10, 13)>, <9, (6, 2, 11)>, <9, (6, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 2, 12)>, <9, (6, 11, 0)>, <9, (6, 11, 12)>, <9, (6, 0, 12)>]

There are [8] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
