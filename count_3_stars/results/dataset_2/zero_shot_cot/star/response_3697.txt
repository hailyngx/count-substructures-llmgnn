Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <2, (1, 3, 5)>
4. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
5. <4, (0, 3, 6)>
6. <5, (2, 4, 8)>
7. <6, (4, 5, 8)>
8. <7, (0, 1, 9)>
9. <8, (5, 6, 5)>
10. <9, (3, 7, 9)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
