Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (17, 16) (17, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 3) (4, 19) (4, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 10) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 16) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 15) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 2) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 6) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 2) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (10, 12, 18)>
<2, (1, 5, 12)>
<3, (13, 16, 19)>
<4, (15, 16, 19)>
<5, (2, 10, 19)>
<6, (7, 15, 19)>
<8, (9, 11, 13)>
<9, (1, 8, 14)>
<12, (0, 2, 17)>
<13, (3, 8, 19)>
<15, (2, 4, 6)>
<16, (3, 6, 17)>
<17, (12, 16, 3)>
<18, (0, 19, 3)>
<19, (2, 4, 6)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
