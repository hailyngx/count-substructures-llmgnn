Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 15) (0, 17) (0, 12) (0, 19) (14, 19) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 15) (18, 1) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 17) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 7) (17, 0) (17, 19) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 16) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (8, 3) (8, 15) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 2) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 10, 1)>
<12, (6, 0, 4)>
<11, (3, 10, 15)>
<5, (10, 4, 19)>
<0, (17, 19, 12)>
<19, (0, 14, 5)>
<16, (6, 9, 13)>
<4, (12, 5, 15)>
<10, (6, 11, 5)>
<15, (11, 5, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<9, (6, 16, 7)>
<3, (11, 8, 3)>
<18, (1, 1, 1)>
<13, (16, 7, 2)>
<2, (13, 16, 12)>
<7, (9, 1, 13)>
<8, (3, 15, 8)>
<17, (0, 19, 17)>
<14, (19, 19, 19)>

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<6, (9, 10, 1)>
<12, (6, 0, 4)>
<11, (3, 10, 15)>
<5, (10, 4, 19)>
<0, (17, 19, 12)>
<19, (0, 14, 5)>
<16, (6, 9, 13)>
<4, (12, 5, 15)>
<1, (6, 9, 10)>
<3, (11, 8, 3)>
<2, (13, 16, 12)>
<7, (9, 1, 6)>
<8, (3, 15, 8)>
<17, (0, 19, 17)>
<14, (19, 0, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
