Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 24) (21, 16) (21, 0) (2, 29) (2, 16) (29, 2) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 24) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 14) (23, 3) (13, 26) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 27) (28, 9) (28, 25) (28, 0) (28, 12) (17, 8) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 20) (19, 5) (19, 3) (19, 6) (18, 26) (18, 11) (16, 21) (16, 2) (16, 25) (16, 8) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 12) (3, 22) (3, 23) (3, 19) (3, 12) (0, 21) (0, 29) (0, 13) (0, 28) (0, 5) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 14) (8, 10) (14, 23) (14, 8) (14, 7) (10, 25) (10, 8) (10, 4) (27, 20) (27, 13) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 12) (7, 1) (7, 14) (4, 26) (4, 10) (4, 24) (24, 1) (24, 29) (24, 4) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
2. For each identified node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If so, form a 3-star with the central node and its three connected nodes as leaves.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 21, 29, 13, and 28.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 22, 23, and 19.

2. Forming 3-stars:
   <0, (21, 29, 13)>
   <0, (21, 29, 28)>
   <0, (21, 13, 28)>
   <3, (22, 23, 19)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
