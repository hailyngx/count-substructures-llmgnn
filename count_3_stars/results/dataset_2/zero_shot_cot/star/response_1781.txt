Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 29) (1, 28) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 23) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 17) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 2) (14, 25) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 11) (2, 3) (2, 29) (2, 22) (2, 19) (2, 15) (29, 1) (29, 2) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 26) (27, 25) (27, 22) (27, 19) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 23) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 26) (8, 18) (23, 21) (23, 9) (24, 3) (24, 25) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 26) (26, 12) (26, 8) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 15) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 10) (13, 10) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 25) (20, 21) (10, 26) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 15) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 10) (16, 3) (16, 28) (16, 18) (28, 1) (28, 5) (28, 16) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 25) (25, 14) (25, 27) (25, 24) (25, 0) (25, 11) (19, 2) (19, 27) (18, 8) (18, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (8, 28, 29)>
<4, (3, 7, 17)>
<3, (2, 7, 24)>
<7, (4, 0, 6)>
<2, (3, 19, 29)>
<21, (20, 23, 9)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<24, (3, 16, 25)>
<22, (2, 26, 27)>
<26, (10, 12, 22)>
<5, (0, 10, 28)>
<10, (5, 13, 26)>
<15, (2, 10, 26)>
<16, (3, 18, 28)>
<25, (0, 11, 14)>
<11, (17, 12, 25)>
<27, (19, 22, 25)>
<12, (6, 11, 15)>
<6, (7, 12, 27)>
<9, (4, 21, 23)>
<8, (0, 1, 26)>
<23, (9, 21, 28)>
<20, (21, 28, 29)>
<13, (10, 14, 25)>
<18, (8, 16, 28)>
<14, (13, 25, 27)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
