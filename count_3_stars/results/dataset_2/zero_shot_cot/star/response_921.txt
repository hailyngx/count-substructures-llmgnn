Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 22) (25, 0) (25, 10) (10, 25) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 29) (11, 10) (11, 13) (8, 23) (8, 16) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 28) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 22) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 20) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 27) (18, 24) (19, 7) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 0) (26, 3) (26, 18) (26, 19) (15, 23) (15, 20) (15, 17) (20, 12) (20, 15) (20, 2) (21, 0) (21, 5) (21, 14) (2, 20) (2, 6) (2, 0) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 17) (17, 15) (17, 22) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 0) (5, 21) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 29) (6, 16) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 21) (0, 2) (0, 9) (29, 10) (29, 6) (29, 13) (27, 18) (27, 16) (28, 23) (28, 9) (28, 13) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 27) (13, 11) (13, 29) (13, 28) (13, 24) (1, 10) (1, 24) (24, 23) (24, 18) (24, 13) (24, 1) (14, 19) (14, 21) (14, 9) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the center nodes of the 3-stars. 

- Node 10 has 5 edges connected to it: (10, 25), (10, 11), (10, 12), (10, 1), (10, 29)
- Node 18 has 5 edges connected to it: (18, 4), (18, 26), (18, 27), (18, 24), (18, 24)
- Node 15 has 3 edges connected to it: (15, 23), (15, 20), (15, 17)
- Node 20 has 3 edges connected to it: (20, 12), (20, 15), (20, 2)
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected to it: (2, 20), (2, 6), (2, 0)
- Node 7 has 3 edges connected to it: (7, 12), (7, 6), (7, 19)
- Node 24 has 4 edges connected to it: (24, 23), (24, 18), (24, 13), (24, 1)
- Node 19 has 4 edges connected to it: (19, 7), (19, 26), (19, 14), (19, 0)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph: 

[7]

Unique 3-stars: 
- <10, (25, 11, 12)>
- <18, (4, 26, 27)>
- <15, (23, 20, 17)>
- <20, (12, 15, 2)>
- <2, (20, 6, 0)>
- <7, (12, 6, 19)>
- <24, (23, 18, 13)>
- <19, (7, 26, 14)>
