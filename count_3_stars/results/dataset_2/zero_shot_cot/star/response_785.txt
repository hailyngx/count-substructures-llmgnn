Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 4) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. From the list of edges, we see that node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 12, and 4, forming a 3-star with node 5 as the central node. <5, (6, 12, 4)>. 

2. Similarly, we find another 3-star with node 9 as the central node. <9, (8, 11, 7)>. 

3. We also find a 3-star with node 8 as the central node. <8, (9, 13, 14)>. 

4. Similarly, 3-star with node 13 as the central node. <13, (8, 1, 14)>. 

5. Another 3-star with node 10 as the central node. <10, (11, 0, 6)>. 

6. 3-star with node 11 as the central node. <11, (9, 10, 7)>. 

7. 3-star with node 6 as the central node. <6, (5, 10, 2)>. 

8. 3-star with node 0 as the central node. <0, (8, 10, 14)>. 

9. 3-star with node 14 as the central node. <14, (8, 10, 4)>. 

10. 3-star with node 7 as the central node. <7, (9, 11, 12)>. 

11. 3-star with node 12 as the central node. <12, (5, 9, 7)>. 

12. 3-star with node 2 as the central node. <2, (6, 0, 1)>. 

13. 3-star with node 3 as the central node. <3, (10, 0, 2)>. 

14. 3-star with node 1 as the central node. <1, (13, 7, 12)>. 

15. 3-star with node 4 as the central node. <4, (5, 10, 14)>. 

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have found a total of 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
