Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

After checking all the edges in the graph, the unique 3-stars are as follows: 
<10, (11, 4, 14)>
<4, (10, 11, 1)>
<14, (5, 10, 13)>
<2, (5, 6, 1)>
<1, (10, 4, 0)>
<3, (10, 4, 12)>
<9, (8, 7, 13)>
<13, (9, 14, 3)>

Thus, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
