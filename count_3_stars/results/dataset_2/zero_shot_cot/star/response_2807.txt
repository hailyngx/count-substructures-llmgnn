Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <5, (6, 1, 3)>
- <4, (9, 7, 0)>
- <7, (5, 4, 12)>
- <1, (5, 9, 3)>
- <3, (5, 1, 11)>
- <10, (7, 11, 0)>
- <11, (3, 10, 12)>
- <8, (1, 3, 2)>
- <12, (9, 7, 11)>
- <2, (7, 8, 13)>
- <6, (5, 8, 14)>
- <13, (7, 1, 2)>
- <0, (9, 4, 10)>
- <14, (4, 8, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [14]
