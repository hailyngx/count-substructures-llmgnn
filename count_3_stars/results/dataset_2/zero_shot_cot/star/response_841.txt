Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, we will identify all 3-stars in the graph based on the definition provided.

Let's start by listing all the nodes along with their degrees based on the given edges:

- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 3
- Node 6 has degree 7
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 9 has degree 6

Next, we will look for the 3-stars in the graph:

1. From the degrees above, we see that Node 6 is connected to 7 other nodes, which is more than 3. So, Node 6 can act as the center of a 3-star with the following leaves: (4, 9, 1) and (7, 0, 8). 
2. Nodes 4, 1, and 9 each have a degree of 4 or more, so they can act as centers of 3-stars. For Node 4, the leaves would be (6, 9, 7). For Node 1, the leaves would be (6, 9, 2). For Node 9, the leaves would be (6, 4, 3).
3. Nodes 7 and 0 each have a degree of 3, just enough to form a 3-star with 3 leaves. For Node 7, the leaves would be (6, 4, 3). For Node 0, the leaves would be (6, 9, 8).

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<6, (4, 9, 1)>
<6, (7, 0, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<1, (6, 9, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>
<7, (6, 4, 3)>
<0, (6, 9, 8)>

Counting these unique 3-stars results in a total of [7].
