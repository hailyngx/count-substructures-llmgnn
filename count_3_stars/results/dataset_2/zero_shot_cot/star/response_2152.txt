Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the edge list, we can find the 3-stars by identifying nodes that meet the criteria.

The nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 12, and 13 (4 connections)
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 14, and 7 (4 connections)
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 1, and 13 (4 connections)
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 4, and 0 (4 connections)
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 2, and 1 (4 connections)
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 13 (3 connections)
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 2 (3 connections)
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 2 (3 connections)
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 0, and 13 (3 connections)
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 0, and 2 (4 connections)
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 0, 4, and 14 (4 connections)
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 12 (3 connections)
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 1, 5, and 4 (4 connections)
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 5 (3 connections)
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4 (2 connections)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<6, (9, 10, 12)>
<6, (9, 10, 13)>
<6, (9, 12, 13)>
<9, (6, 10, 12)>
<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<10, (6, 9, 12)>
<10, (6, 9, 13)>
<10, (6, 8, 1)>
<10, (9, 13, 1)>
<12, (6, 9, 13)>
<12, (6, 7, 4)>
<12, (6, 8, 0)>
<12, (0, 4, 5)>
<13, (6, 9, 10)>
<13, (6, 10, 2)>
<13, (6, 2, 1)>
<1, (10, 11, 13)>
<4, (11, 12, 0)>
<4, (11, 12, 5)>
<4, (11, 0, 2)>
<4, (12, 0, 5)>
<4, (12, 0, 2)>
<5, (11, 0, 4)>
<5, (11, 4, 14)>
<5, (0, 4, 11)>
<5, (0, 4, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
