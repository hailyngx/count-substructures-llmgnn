Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 4) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes in the graph based on the edges given:

- Central Node 6: Connected to nodes 14, 10, and 12.
- Central Node 9: Connected to nodes 8, 14, and 13.
- Central Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 5, and 10.
- Central Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Central Node 7: Connected to nodes 3, 12, and 2.
- Central Node 12: Connected to nodes 6, 7, and 13.
- Central Node 2: Connected to nodes 7, 5, and 10.
- Central Node 8: Connected to nodes 9, 3, and 12.
- Central Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 8, and 10.
- Central Node 10: Connected to nodes 6, 1, and 2.
- Central Node 11: Connected to nodes 12, 14, and 5.
- Central Node 14: Connected to nodes 6, 9, and 8.
- Central Node 5: Connected to nodes 1, 2, and 10.
- Central Node 13: Connected to nodes 9 and 12.
- Central Node 4: Connected to nodes 6, 0, 10, 14, and 5.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 6: 1
- For node 9: 1
- For node 1: 1
- For node 3: 1
- For node 7: 1
- For node 12: 1
- For node 2: 1
- For node 8: 1
- For node 0: 1
- For node 10: 1
- For node 11: 1
- For node 14: 1
- For node 5: 1
- For node 13: 1
- For node 4: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [15]

Unique 3-stars: 
<6, (14, 10, 12)>
