Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for each node with exactly three edges connected to it. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Let's identify them first:

- Node 0 (connected to 9, 6, 8, and 13)
- Node 1 (connected to 11, 2, 13, and 8)
- Node 3 (connected to 11, 14, and 6)
- Node 5 (connected to 9, 13, and 2)
- Node 7 (connected to 2, 13, and 8)
- Node 12 (connected to 8, 13, 11, and 14)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars using the center nodes we found:

<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<0, (9, 8, 13)>
<0, (6, 8, 13)>
<0, (9, 8, 13)>

<1, (11, 2, 13)>
<1, (11, 8, 13)>
<1, (11, 8, 2)>

<3, (11, 14, 6)>

<5, (9, 13, 2)>

<7, (2, 13, 8)>

<12, (8, 13, 11)>
<12, (8, 13, 14)>

Final count: [11]
