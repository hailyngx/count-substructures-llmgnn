Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.
1. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 13. <6, (5, 10, 13)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 10, and 13. <9, (8, 10, 13)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 14, and 3. <8, (5, 14, 3)>
4. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 12. <13, (6, 9, 12)>
5. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 4. <5, (6, 8, 4)>
6. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 10, and 12. <0, (7, 10, 12)>
7. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 11, and 1. <14, (8, 11, 1)>
8. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 5, and 4. <3, (8, 5, 4)>
9. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 12, and 1. <11, (14, 12, 1)>
10. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 14, and 2. <1, (8, 14, 2)>
11. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 0. <10, (6, 9, 0)>

There are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph based on the provided edges. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].
