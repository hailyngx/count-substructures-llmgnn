Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 18) (12, 4) (12, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 5) (17, 1) (17, 0) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 11) (13, 7) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 6) (0, 17) (0, 3) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 3) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 9) (11, 19) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 0) (16, 8) (16, 1) (6, 12) (6, 18) (14, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, which can potentially be the center of a 3-star. Nodes 4, 15, 1, 7, 5, 19, 8, 17, 0, 10, 18, 3, 2, 9, 11 have three neighbors each.

Next, we will check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star.

- For node 4, we have <4, (7, 12, 10)>.
- For node 15, we have <15, (7, 8, 1)> and <15, (11, 19, 8)>.
- For node 1, we have <1, (17, 15, 5)>.
- For node 7, we have <7, (4, 15, 2)> and <7, (15, 8, 13)>.
- For node 5, we have <5, (1, 19, 3)>.
- For node 19, we have <19, (5, 11, 2)>.
- For node 8, we have <8, (16, 15, 18)>.
- For node 17, we have <17, (1, 0, 16)>.
- For node 0, we have <0, (17, 3, 11)>.
- For node 10, we have <10, (4, 9, 18)> and <10, (3, 18, 10)>.
- For node 18, we have <18, (8, 10, 6)>.
- For node 3, we have <3, (5, 0, 10)>.
- For node 2, we have <2, (7, 5, 19)>.
- For node 9, we have <9, (2, 11, 10)>.
- For node 11, we have <11, (19, 15, 0)>.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [16] 3-stars.
