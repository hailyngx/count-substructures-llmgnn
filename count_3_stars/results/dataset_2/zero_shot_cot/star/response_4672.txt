Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 15) (21, 29) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 28) (3, 27) (15, 21) (15, 3) (15, 9) (18, 23) (18, 28) (18, 29) (22, 16) (22, 24) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 25) (17, 5) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 25) (28, 1) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 18) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 25) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 19) (11, 3) (11, 27) (11, 8) (11, 2) (20, 29) (20, 4) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 20) (19, 13) (19, 23) (19, 9) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 7) (23, 12) (4, 10) (4, 20) (4, 27) (4, 12) (27, 3) (27, 11) (27, 4) (12, 1) (12, 23) (12, 4) (12, 9) (25, 17) (25, 0) (25, 14) (25, 5) (7, 1) (7, 23) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 11) (8, 16) (9, 15) (9, 19) (9, 12) (9, 24) (24, 22) (24, 9) (6, 10) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly 3 connected edges (leaves) and the remaining edges connected to other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Node 1 has edges connected to 4 other nodes: (21, 7, 12). It forms a 3-star: <1, (21, 7, 12)>.
2. Node 21 has edges connected to 4 other nodes: (1, 28, 15, 29). It forms a 3-star: <21, (1, 28, 15)>.
3. Node 3 has edges connected to 4 other nodes: (15, 11, 28, 27). It forms a 3-star: <3, (15, 11, 28)>.
4. Node 15 has edges connected to 3 other nodes: (21, 3, 9). It forms a 3-star: <15, (21, 3, 9)>.
5. Node 18 has edges connected to 3 other nodes: (23, 28, 29). It forms a 3-star: <18, (23, 28, 29)>.
6. Node 5 has edges connected to 4 other nodes: (10, 17, 13, 25). It forms a 3-star: <5, (10, 17, 13)>.
7. Node 13 has edges connected to 4 other nodes: (5, 16, 2, 19). It forms a 3-star: <13, (5, 16, 2)>.
8. Node 11 has edges connected to 4 other nodes: (3, 27, 8, 2). It forms a 3-star: <11, (3, 27, 8)>.
9. Node 4 has edges connected to 4 other nodes: (10, 20, 27, 12). It forms a 3-star: <4, (10, 20, 27)>.
10. Node 9 has edges connected to 4 other nodes: (15, 19, 12, 24). It forms a 3-star: <9, (15, 19, 12)>.
11. Node 23 has edges connected to 4 other nodes: (18, 19, 7, 12). It forms a 3-star: <23, (18, 19, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(10)].
