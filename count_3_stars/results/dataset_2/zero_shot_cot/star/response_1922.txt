Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (12, 4) (12, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to the node 4 since the center must have exactly three connections:

- Node 7, Node 12, Node 9, and Node 0 are connected to Node 4.

Now, we will find all the 3-stars with the center at Node 4 by considering all possible combinations of three connected nodes. 

1. <4, (7, 12, 9)>
2. <4, (7, 12, 0)>
3. <4, (7, 9, 0)>

Thus, there are 3 unique 3-stars with the center at Node 4.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
