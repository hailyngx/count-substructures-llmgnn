Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 4, 8, and 11 are the nodes with three edges connected to them.

Next, let's count the number of 3-star configurations for each center node:
- For node 1, there are 3 possible 3-star configurations (1, 5, 0), (1, 9, 7), and (1, 10, 4).
- For node 4, there are 3 possible 3-star configurations (4, 7, 6), (4, 8, 10), and (4, 3, 2).
- For node 8, there are 3 possible 3-star configurations (8, 0, 13), (8, 11, 2), and (8, 10, 4).
- For node 11, there is 1 possible 3-star configuration (11, 5, 1).

Therefore, there are a total of 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 10 unique 3-stars. 

So, the final answer is [10].
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<1, (5, 0, 1)>, 
<1, (9, 7, 1)>, 
<1, (10, 4, 1)>, 
<4, (7, 6, 4)>,
<4, (8, 10, 4)>, 
<4, (3, 2, 4)>, 
<8, (0, 13, 8)>, 
<8, (11, 2, 8)>, 
<8, (10, 4, 8)>, 
<11, (5, 1, 11)>.
