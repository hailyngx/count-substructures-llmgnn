Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 19) (15, 2) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 19) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 10) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 13) (11, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 2) (12, 19) (14, 2) (17, 0) (17, 11) (10, 9) (10, 18) (10, 7) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 9) (19, 16) (19, 12) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure by looking for nodes with exactly three edges. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with exactly three edges are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 16, 17, 2)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 5, 8, 0)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 2, 19, 14)

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (16, 17, 2)>
<1, (5, 8, 0)>
<12, (2, 19, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
