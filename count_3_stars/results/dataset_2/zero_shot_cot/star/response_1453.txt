Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 22) (15, 9) (15, 6) (15, 25) (15, 14) (2, 29) (2, 12) (2, 21) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 23) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 16) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (8, 6) (13, 26) (13, 6) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 22) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 4) (0, 21) (0, 17) (0, 26) (20, 23) (20, 10) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 26) (21, 2) (21, 0) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 19) (26, 13) (26, 0) (26, 7) (1, 17) (1, 6) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 18) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 22) (11, 14) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (10, 20) (10, 23) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 18) (22, 3) (22, 12) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 24) (25, 15) (25, 29) (25, 5) (19, 28) (19, 16) (18, 17) (18, 14) (18, 24) (16, 5) (16, 22) (16, 19) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 23) (23, 29) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 24) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <2, (12, 3, 22)>
2. <27, (12, 3, 4)>
3. <15, (9, 5, 25)>
4. <29, (25, 2, 23)>
5. <6, (7, 13, 15)>
6. <7, (12, 14, 26)>
7. <21, (2, 0, 28)>
8. <0, (17, 21, 26)>
9. <17, (1, 0, 18)>
10. <22, (12, 3, 4)>
11. <16, (5, 22, 19)>
12. <24, (22, 18, 23)>
13. <20, (10, 23, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
