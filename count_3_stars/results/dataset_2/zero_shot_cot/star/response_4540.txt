Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 24) (9, 23) (9, 0) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 18) (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 18) (27, 12) (27, 28) (27, 13) (5, 24) (5, 20) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 11) (13, 7) (11, 13) (11, 20) (11, 15) (11, 25) (18, 3) (18, 12) (18, 24) (26, 16) (26, 0) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 22) (17, 4) (17, 21) (20, 6) (20, 5) (20, 11) (20, 17) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 21) (21, 17) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 15) (8, 22) (19, 6) (19, 2) (19, 29) (23, 9) (28, 27) (7, 13) (7, 29) (29, 19) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 29) (14, 2) (16, 26) (16, 17) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 24) (4, 17) (25, 11) (0, 9) (0, 26) (0, 29) (24, 9) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 2) (15, 11) (15, 21) (15, 29) (15, 22) (22, 17) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star structure.

Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <6, (9, 14, 10)>
2. <9, (6, 24, 23)>
3. <10, (6, 1, 21)>
4. <14, (6, 3, 12)>
5. <27, (12, 28, 13)>
6. <13, (1, 27, 11)>
7. <11, (13, 20, 15)>
8. <18, (3, 12, 24)>
9. <24, (9, 5, 18)>
10. <20, (6, 5, 11)>
11. <21, (10, 17, 15)>
12. <17, (20, 16, 22)>
13. <29, (19, 7, 15)>
14. <16, (26, 17, 0)>
15. <2, (19, 14, 24)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
