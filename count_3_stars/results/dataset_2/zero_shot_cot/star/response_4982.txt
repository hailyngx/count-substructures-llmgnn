Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph.

From the edges provided, we can see the following 3-stars:
1. <5, (9, 6, 2)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 0)>
3. <4, (7, 6, 2)>
4. <7, (4, 6, 3)>
5. <6, (5, 9, 4)>
6. <1, (5, 7, 3)>
7. <3, (4, 7, 1)>
8. <8, (5, 0, 47)>
9. <0, (5, 9, 2)>

Thus, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
