Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 15) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (18, 9) (18, 4) (18, 7) (3, 14) (3, 16) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (16, 3) (16, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 13) 

Response:
Let's go step by step to count the number of 3-star graphs in this given graph:

1. Identify the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
   - Node 6 has neighbors 9, 17, 0.
   - Node 17 has neighbors 6, 14, 19.
   - Node 14 has neighbors 17, 3, 1.
   - Node 4 has neighbors 8, 18, 12.
   - Node 12 has neighbors 4, 7, 2.
   - Node 1 has neighbors 14, 11, 15.
   - Node 15 has neighbors 17, 1, 10.
   - Node 10 has neighbors 15, 2, 16.
   - Node 2 has neighbors 7, 12, 10.
   - Node 5 has neighbors 17, 1, 2.
   - Node 19 has neighbors 14, 17, 13.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph:
   - There are 3-stars at nodes 6, 17, 14, 4, 12, 1, 15, 10, 2, 5, 19.

3. Output the answer inside brackets:
   - [11]

List of unique 3-stars found:
   - <6, (9, 17, 0)>
   - <17, (6, 14, 19)>
   - <14, (17, 3, 1)>
   - <4, (8, 18, 12)>
   - <12, (4, 7, 2)>
   - <1, (14, 11, 15)>
   - <15, (17, 1, 10)>
   - <10, (15, 2, 16)>
   - <2, (7, 12, 10)>
   - <5, (17, 1, 2)>
   - <19, (14, 17, 13)>
