Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3, as those can potentially be the center of a 3-star. Since each 3-star has exactly 4 nodes, 1 center and 3 leaves, we will look for nodes with exactly 3 incident edges.

Nodes with degree 3: 5, 9, 6, 8, 1.

Now, let's check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star structure with their neighbors.

For node 5:
- Neighbors: 9, 4, 0, 3, 7
- <5, (9, 4, 0)> is a 3-star structure.

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 5, 6, 2, 3, 0
- <9, (5, 6, 2)> is a 3-star structure.

For node 6:
- Neighbors: 9, 2, 4
- <6, (9, 2, 4)> is a 3-star structure.

For node 8:
- Neighbors: 4, 2
- No 3-star structure.

For node 1:
- Neighbors: 4, 2
- No 3-star structure.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
<5, (9, 4, 0)>
