Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 7) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 25) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 16) (27, 4) (27, 23) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 12) (21, 10) (21, 2) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 6) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 20) (18, 7) (13, 26) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 23) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 5) (4, 27) (4, 11) (4, 28) (23, 27) (23, 13) (23, 6) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 9) (19, 29) (22, 16) (22, 20) (29, 9) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 29) (24, 11) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 25) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 16) (20, 18) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 26) (25, 28) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges:
(9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 7) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 25) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 16) (27, 4) (27, 23) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 28) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (0, 7) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 12) (21, 10) (21, 2) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 6) (2, 17) (2, 21) (18, 20) (18, 7) (13, 26) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 23) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 29) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 5) (4, 27) (4, 11) (4, 28) (23, 27) (23, 13) (23, 6) (8, 20) (8, 6) (19, 9) (19, 29) (22, 16) (22, 20) (29, 9) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 12) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 29) (24, 11) (28, 14) (28, 4) (28, 25) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 16) (20, 18) (20, 8) (20, 22) (25, 26) (25, 28) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 16) (16, 15) (16, 3) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 5)

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (15, 13, 12)>
<2, (17, 21, 10)>
<3, (14, 16, 5)>
<4, (27, 11, 4)>
<5, (7, 5, 9)>
<6, (6, 16, 23)>
<7, (0, 7, 18)>
<8, (20, 22, 8)>
<9, (19, 29, 9)>
<10, (10, 17, 21)>
<11, (11, 6, 24)>
<12, (28, 25, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
