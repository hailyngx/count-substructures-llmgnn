Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 10, 13)>
<1, (3, 4, 10)>
<13, (1, 9, 14)>
