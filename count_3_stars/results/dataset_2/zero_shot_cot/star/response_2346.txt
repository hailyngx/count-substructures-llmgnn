Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (26, 28) (26, 20) (4, 7) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 27) (22, 10) (22, 0) (22, 12) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 27) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 8) (24, 14) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 10) (21, 4) (21, 23) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 15) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 13) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 20) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 20) (17, 0) (20, 26) (20, 11) (20, 17) (20, 14) (0, 22) (0, 17) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 5) (29, 12) (29, 16) (27, 3) (27, 23) (27, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 18) (25, 16) (25, 14) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 8) (2, 23) (2, 16) (2, 27) (2, 10) (14, 24) (14, 20) (14, 25) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern <center, leaves> and then count how many times each pattern appears in the graph.

Based on the given edges, the possible 3-star patterns are as follows:
1. <3, (1, 9, 11)>
2. <4, (7, 15, 17)>
3. <5, (1, 15, 19)>
4. <7, (4, 5, 12)>
5. <8, (1, 11, 18)>
6. <9, (3, 13, 19)>
7. <10, (2, 22, 28)>
8. <11, (3, 8, 20)>
9. <12, (7, 8, 29)>
10. <13, (9, 18, 19)>
11. <14, (20, 24, 25)>
12. <15, (4, 5, 7)>
13. <16, (2, 28, 29)>
14. <17, (4, 17, 19)>
15. <18, (5, 8, 13)>
16. <19, (5, 9, 13)>
17. <20, (11, 14, 17)>
18. <21, (4, 15, 23)>
19. <22, (10, 12, 28)>
20. <23, (2, 21, 27)>
21. <25, (14, 16, 25)>
22. <26, (20, 26, 28)>
23. <27, (2, 3, 23)>
24. <28, (10, 16, 26)>
25. <29, (12, 16, 29)>

Counting the occurrences of each unique 3-star pattern:
- Pattern 3 occurs once.
- Pattern 6 occurs once.
- Pattern 13 occurs once.
- Pattern 15 occurs once.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
Unique 3-stars: <3, (1, 9, 11)>, <9, (3, 13, 19)>, <10, (2, 22, 28)>, <23, (2, 21, 27)>.
