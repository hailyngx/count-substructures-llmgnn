Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 25) (16, 10) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 5) (22, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 7) (22, 1) (1, 22) (1, 14) (26, 29) (26, 0) (26, 12) (4, 18) (28, 0) (28, 24) (29, 26) (29, 7) (29, 13) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 25) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 23) (23, 9) (23, 19) (12, 26) (12, 24) (12, 17) (6, 11) (6, 24) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 12) (24, 6) (24, 10) (19, 15) (19, 23) (19, 17) (19, 13) (0, 26) (0, 28) (0, 9) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 2) (17, 8) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 3) (17, 5) (7, 22) (7, 29) (7, 8) (2, 3) (2, 14) (20, 22) (20, 21) (21, 20) (21, 5) (10, 16) (10, 24) (10, 3) (14, 1) (14, 2) (27, 18) (27, 8) (13, 29) (13, 19) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (25, 11) (25, 16) (25, 15) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. From the given edges, we can see that node 11, 16, and 25 each form a 3-star with the nodes they are connected to. These are:
   - <11, (6, 16, 25)>
   - <16, (10, 11, 25)>
   - <25, (11, 15, 16)>

2. Node 18 has two edges and can form two 3-stars:
   - <18, (4, 5, 22)>
   - <18, (4, 27, 22)>

3. Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 20, and 24:
   - <22, (1, 20, 24)>

4. Similarly, node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 22, and 16:
   - <1, (14, 16, 22)>

5. Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 12, and 29:
   - <26, (0, 12, 29)>

6. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 27, and 5:
   - <4, (18, 5, 27)>

7. Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 24, and 10:
   - <28, (0, 10, 24)>

8. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and 23:
   - <9, (0, 8, 23)>

9. Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 19, and 17:
   - <23, (9, 17, 19)>

10. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 19, and 25:
    - <15, (8, 19, 25)>

11. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 15, and 8. (Note: This is a self-loop)
    - <8, (7, 8, 15)>

12. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 2, and 17:
    - <3, (0, 2, 17)>

13. Node 7, 13, 20, and 21 each form a 3-star with the nodes they are connected to, but these are already covered in the above cases.

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars: [12]
