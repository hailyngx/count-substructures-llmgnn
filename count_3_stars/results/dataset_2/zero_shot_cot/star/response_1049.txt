Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 26) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 29) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 27) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 6) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 9) (28, 24) (28, 5) (24, 28) (24, 26) (26, 17) (26, 24) (26, 7) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 5) (21, 3) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 2) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 6) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 9) (25, 27) (25, 5) (25, 2) (27, 8) (27, 25) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 13) (19, 7) (19, 29) (19, 23) (16, 28) (10, 6) (10, 22) (12, 18) (12, 9) (20, 8) (29, 4) (29, 0) (29, 19) (29, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 10) (9, 28) (9, 7) (9, 12) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 18) (5, 28) (5, 3) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 22) (2, 14) (2, 15) (2, 25) (2, 23) (23, 19) (23, 2) (22, 10) (22, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step by step:

1. Central nodes with exactly 3 neighbors are candidates for the center of a 3-star.
   
   - Node 14 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 17 has 3 neighbors.
   - Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 8 has 5 neighbors.
   - Node 11 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 28 has 5 neighbors.
   - Node 24 has 3 neighbors.
   - Node 26 has 3 neighbors.
   - Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 15 has 3 neighbors.
   - Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
   - Node 29 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
   - Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
   - Node 23 has 2 neighbors.
   - Node 22 has 2 neighbors.

2. Identify 3-stars with the center and leaves:
   
   - 3-star with center 17: <17, (14, 3, 26)>
   - 3-star with center 24: <24, (28, 26, 7)>
   - 3-star with center 26: <26, (17, 24, 7)>
   - 3-star with center 3: <3, (17, 11, 21)>
   - 3-star with center 15: <15, (4, 18, 2)>
   - 3-star with center 0: <0, (7, 29, 6)>
   - 3-star with center 29: <29, (4, 0, 5)>
   - 3-star with center 5: <5, (28, 3, 25)>
   - 3-star with center 22: <22, (10, 5, 2)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
   
   - The unique 3-stars identified are: <17, (14, 3, 26)>, <24, (28, 26, 7)>, <26, (17, 24, 7)>, <3, (17, 11, 21)>, <15, (4, 18, 2)>, <0, (7, 29, 6)>, <29, (4, 0, 5)>, and <5, (28, 3, 25)>, <22, (10, 5, 2)>
   
   - The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
