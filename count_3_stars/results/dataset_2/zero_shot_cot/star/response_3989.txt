Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 12) (0, 7) (0, 9) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 1) (10, 15) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 9) (17, 4) (17, 6) (17, 13) (18, 19) (11, 19) (11, 2) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 16) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 1) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 3 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 6, 15, and 5. (<3, (6, 15, 5)>)
2. Node 4 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8. (<4, (5, 7, 8)>)
3. Node 6 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 3, 5, and 12. (<6, (3, 5, 12)>)
4. Node 7 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9. (<7, (0, 4, 9)>)
5. Node 8 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 4, 5, and 12. (<8, (4, 5, 12)>)
6. Node 9 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 0, 7, and 13. (<9, (0, 7, 13)>)
7. Node 10 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 15, 14, and 16. (<10, (15, 14, 16)>)
8. Node 11 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 2, 19, and 1. (<11, (2, 19, 1)>)
9. Node 12 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 1, 8, and 6. (<12, (1, 8, 6)>)
10. Node 13 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 1, 9, and 17. (<13, (1, 9, 17)>)
11. Node 14 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 4, 15, and 19. (<14, (4, 15, 19)>)
12. Node 15 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 3, 14, and 12. (<15, (3, 14, 12)>)
13. Node 16 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 10, 14, and 2. (<16, (10, 14, 2)>)
14. Node 17 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 4, 6, and 13. (<17, (4, 6, 13)>)
15. Node 19 is the center of the 3-star, connected to nodes 11, 14, and 18. (<19, (11, 14, 18)>)

All these are the unique 3-stars in the graph. Counting them, we find there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
