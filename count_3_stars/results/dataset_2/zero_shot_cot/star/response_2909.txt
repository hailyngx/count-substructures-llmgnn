Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 15) (9, 20) (26, 24) (1, 24) (1, 13) (21, 8) (21, 11) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (27, 11) (27, 8) (27, 16) (8, 21) (8, 27) (8, 13) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 17) (5, 18) (5, 25) (5, 15) (6, 28) (6, 25) (6, 4) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 23) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 16) (28, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 29) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 21) (11, 27) (11, 3) (11, 7) (17, 18) (17, 20) (24, 26) (24, 1) (24, 10) (10, 0) (10, 24) (10, 16) (4, 6) (4, 20) (4, 22) (4, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 14) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 29) (29, 22) (29, 7) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 4) (23, 15) (23, 25) (23, 16) (25, 13) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 23) (16, 27) (16, 20) (16, 10) (16, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node to form the 3-stars. Based on the given edges, we have:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 22, 15, and 20.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 24 and 13.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 8 and 11.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 10, and 3.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 16.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 21, 27, and 13.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 25.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 18, 25, and 15.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 28, 25, and 4.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 9, 17, and 4.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 12, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 13, 12, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5, 12, and 17.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 15, 3, and 11.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 22, 7, and 4.

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- Involving node 9: <9, (22, 15, 20)>
- Involving node 1: <1, (24, 13, _)>
- Involving node 21: <21, (8, 11, _)>
- Involving node 0: <0, (14, 10, _)>
- Involving node 27: <27, (11, 8, 16)>
- Involving node 8: <8, (21, 27, 13)>
- Involving node 13: <13, (1, 8, 25)>
- Involving node 5: <5, (18, 25, 15)>
- Involving node 6: <6, (28, 25, 4)>
- Involving node 20: <20, (9, 17, 4)>
- Involving node 14: <14, (0, 12, _)>
- Involving node 2: <2, (13, 12, 19)>
- Involving node 18: <18, (5, 12, 17)>
- Involving node 7: <7, (15, 3, 11)>
- Involving node 29: <29, (22, 7, 4)>

Counting the unique 3-stars mentioned above, we get a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
