Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (9, 8) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 19) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 19) (4, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph based on the edges provided:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 6, and 12: <3, (15, 6, 12)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 18, and 14: <15, (3, 18, 14)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 17, and 4: <6, (3, 17, 4)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 13, and 4: <17, (6, 13, 4)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 15, and 10: <12, (3, 15, 10)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 18, and 0: <10, (12, 18, 0)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 9, and 1: <0, (10, 9, 1)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 0, and 18: <9, (8, 0, 18)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 12, and 3: <8, (9, 12, 3)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 11, and 19: <14, (15, 11, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
