Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 2) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 8) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and the nodes connected to them by exactly three edges. 

Let's find the 3-stars:
1. Central node 11: (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 5) <11, (3, 5, 10)>
2. Central node 16: (16, 12), (16, 6), (16, 9) <16, (6, 9, 12)>
3. Central node 10: (10, 11), (10, 3), (10, 18) <10, (3, 11, 18)>
4. Central node 3: (3, 11), (3, 7), (3, 10) <3, (7, 10, 11)>
5. Central node 0: (0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 8) <0, (1, 7, 8)>
6. No other central nodes found.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
