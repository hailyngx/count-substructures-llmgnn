Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to node 5:

(5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4)

Therefore, node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 4. 
<5, (9, 2, 4)>

Next, we identify the nodes that are connected to node 9:

(9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 0)

Therefore, node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 7. 
<9, (5, 8, 7)>

Moving on, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1:

(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 0)

Therefore, node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 0. 
<1, (2, 4, 0)>

Now, the nodes connected to node 3:

(3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 4)

Therefore, node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 0, and 8. 
<3, (7, 0, 8)>

Finally, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 6:

(6, 8), (6, 0), (6, 7)

Therefore, node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 0, and 7. 
<6, (8, 0, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
