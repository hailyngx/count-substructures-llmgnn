Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 12) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 6) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's analyze each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star with its neighboring nodes:
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 1: <5, (9, 8, 1)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, and 0: <9, (5, 10, 0)>
- Node 4 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 7 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 12 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 8: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 2: <8, (5, 7, 2)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 1: <0, (9, 10, 1)>
- Node 14 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 3 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 11 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 12, and 0: <1, (5, 12, 0)>
- Node 6 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 0: <10, (9, 2, 0)>
- Node 13 does not form a 3-star since it is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <5, (9, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 10, 0)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 2)>, <0, (9, 10, 1)>, <1, (5, 12, 0)>, and <10, (9, 2, 0)>.

Since there are 7 unique 3-stars, the final answer is [7].
