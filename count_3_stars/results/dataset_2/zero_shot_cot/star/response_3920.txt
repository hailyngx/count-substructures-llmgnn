Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8


Next, we need to check for any 3-stars. To do this, we look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them, which would indicate a center of a 3-star.

As we analyze the graph, we find the following 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
