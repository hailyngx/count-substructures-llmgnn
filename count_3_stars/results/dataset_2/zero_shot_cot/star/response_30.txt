Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 13) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 9) (15, 1) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 9) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (16, 6) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 4) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 18) (19, 3) (19, 12) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 18) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 1) (8, 17) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 16) (4, 3) (2, 6) (2, 16) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 14) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 3) 

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Each 3-star will have a center node and three leaf nodes.

The node degrees are as follows:
Node 0: 4
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 5
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 3
Node 8: 2
Node 9: 4
Node 10: 1
Node 11: 3
Node 12: 4
Node 13: 3
Node 14: 3
Node 15: 1
Node 16: 4
Node 17: 4
Node 18: 4
Node 19: 3

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<5, (6, 7, 12)>
<6, (5, 3, 16)>
<12, (5, 0, 14)>
<16, (6, 7, 4)>
<0, (11, 18, 12)>
<7, (5, 16, 13)>
<1, (15, 11, 9)>
<13, (7, 17, 9)>
<17, (13, 9, 8)>
<18, (0, 19, 9)>
<4, (16, 3, 10)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. The final answer is [10].
