Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let’s find all the 3-stars in the graph. 
Let’s identify the central nodes first, as they are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Central nodes: 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, 8, 0, 2

Now, let's find the leaves connected to each central node:
- Central node 5: (2, 1, 4, 3, 7)
- Central node 9: (6, 8, 2, 7, 0)
- Central node 4: (5, 7, 8, 0, 6)
- Central node 7: (5, 9, 4, 8)
- Central node 1: (5, 3, 2)
- Central node 3: (5, 1, 0)
- Central node 6: (9, 4, 2, 8)
- Central node 8: (9, 4, 7, 6)
- Central node 0: (9, 4, 3)
- Central node 2: (5, 9, 1, 6)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<5, (2, 1, 4)>, <5, (3, 1, 2)>, <5, (4, 7, 2)>, <5, (7, 9, 4)>, <9, (6, 8, 2)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <9, (7, 0, 2)>, <4, (7, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 4, 8)>, <1, (5, 2, 3)>, <3, (5, 0, 1)>, <6, (8, 9, 4)>, <6, (4, 8, 2)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (9, 4, 7)>
