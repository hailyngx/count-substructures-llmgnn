Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 25) (1, 20) (1, 23) (1, 8) (21, 0) (21, 23) (5, 2) (5, 28) (5, 16) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 0) (0, 21) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 17) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 29) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 16) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 20) (8, 1) (8, 28) (22, 6) (22, 28) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 6) (11, 25) (28, 5) (28, 8) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 24) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 25) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 16) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 13) (4, 19) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 14) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 14) (24, 29) (20, 1) (20, 2) (20, 6) (17, 0) (17, 23) (25, 26) (25, 11) (25, 18) (29, 3) (29, 24) (29, 13) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 29) (13, 14) (13, 6) (6, 15) (6, 22) (6, 11) (6, 20) (6, 13) (23, 9) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 17) (14, 16) (14, 24) (14, 13) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (21, 17, 27)>
<1, (20, 8, 23)>
<2, (3, 5, 20)>
<6, (11, 13, 15)>
<13, (6, 10, 14)>
<14, (13, 16, 24)>
<15, (3, 6, 27)>
<16, (5, 12, 19)>
<18, (10, 19, 25)>
<19, (4, 16, 18)>
<20, (1, 2, 6)>
<21, (0, 9, 23)>
<24, (11, 14, 28)>
<25, (11, 18, 26)>
<26, (9, 25, 29)>
<27, (15, 21, 0)>
<28, (8, 11, 24)>
<29, (3, 13, 24)>

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
