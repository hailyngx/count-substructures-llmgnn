Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 

Nodes connected to node 4: 0, 3, 7
Nodes connected to node 1: 0, 3, 6, 7, 9, 13
Nodes connected to node 3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 14
Nodes connected to node 10: 2, 9, 11, 12
Nodes connected to node 11: 3, 7, 9, 10, 12
Nodes connected to node 12: 5, 10, 11
Nodes connected to node 2: 4, 8, 10
Nodes connected to node 8: 2, 3, 7
Nodes connected to node 5: 3, 12, 13
Nodes connected to node 6: 0, 1, 14
Nodes connected to node 13: 1, 5, 9
Nodes connected to node 0: 1, 4, 6
Nodes connected to node 14: 1, 3, 6, 7, 9

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<10, (2, 9, 12)>
<11, (9, 10, 12)>
<2, (4, 8, 10)>
<5, (3, 12, 13)>
<6, (0, 1, 14)>
<13, (1, 5, 9)>
<14, (1, 6, 9)>
