Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 10) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 10) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the center node and its adjacent nodes. 

The nodes with their adjacent nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: (9, 14, 2, 11)
- Node 1: (6, 3, 2, 7)
- Node 2: (1, 4, 0, 5, 10)
- Node 3: (6, 1, 13, 12, 8)
- Node 4: (9, 7, 8, 12, 11, 2)
- Node 5: (7, 2, 11)
- Node 6: (1, 10, 3)
- Node 7: (9, 1, 4, 14, 13, 5)
- Node 8: (3, 4)
- Node 9: (4, 7, 0)
- Node 10: (6, 2, 13, 12)
- Node 11: (4, 0, 5, 12)
- Node 12: (3, 4, 10, 11)
- Node 13: (3, 7, 14, 10)
- Node 14: (9, 0, 7, 13)

Based on the list above, there are no 3-stars in the given graph.
