Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 28) (2, 29) (2, 18) (29, 2) (29, 8) (29, 14) (3, 15) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (8, 29) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 27) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 28) (4, 5) (4, 8) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 1) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 11) (28, 9) (28, 13) (28, 24) (20, 27) (20, 22) (17, 24) (17, 27) (1, 8) (1, 18) (24, 28) (24, 17) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 23) (7, 6) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 7) (25, 19) (25, 22) (10, 21) (10, 12) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 14) (22, 20) (22, 25) (22, 12) (23, 26) (23, 12) (12, 21) (12, 10) (12, 22) (12, 23) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 6) (0, 18) (0, 11) (0, 19) (11, 5) (11, 15) (11, 21) (11, 0) (11, 27) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 0) (27, 8) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them.

Observing the edges, we can identify the following nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 8 has edges connected to nodes 29, 13, and 4.
- Node 13 has edges connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 29 has edges connected to nodes 2, 8, and 14.
- Node 6 has edges connected to nodes 9, 7, and 13.
- Node 15 has edges connected to nodes 3, 11, and 16.
- Node 18 has edges connected to nodes 2, 14, and 0.
- Node 21 has edges connected to nodes 10, 12, and 11.
- Node 14 has edges connected to nodes 29, 18, and 16.
- Node 0 has edges connected to nodes 6, 18, and 11.
- Node 11 has edges connected to nodes 5, 15, and 21.
- Node 19 has edges connected to nodes 3, 25, and 0.
- Node 27 has edges connected to nodes 8, 20, and 17.
- Node 12 has edges connected to nodes 21, 10, and 22.

After identifying the nodes, we can construct the unique 3-stars:
<8, (29, 13, 4)>
<13, (5, 6, 8)>
<29, (2, 8, 14)>
<6, (9, 7, 13)>
<15, (3, 11, 16)>
<18, (2, 14, 0)>
<21, (10, 12, 11)>
<14, (29, 18, 16)>
<0, (6, 18, 11)>
<11, (5, 15, 21)>
<19, (3, 25, 0)>
<27, (8, 20, 17)>
<12, (21, 10, 22)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
