Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like pattern. 

Let's go through the nodes one by one:
1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 6, 2, and 3 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 5, 2, 0, and 9 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 14, and 0 forming the 3-star <2, (5, 1, 14)>.
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 7, and 0 forming the 3-star <3, (8, 12, 7)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 5 forming a line.
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 11, 4, 6, 2, 1, and 7 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 12, and 0 forming the 3-star <6, (5, 7, 12)>.
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 13, 5, 6, 3, and 0 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 0, 12, and 3 forming the 3-star <8, (10, 12, 3)>.
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 13, 10, 4, 14, and 1 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
11. Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 9, and 0 forming the 3-star <10, (8, 11, 9)>.
12. Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 0, 5 but it doesn't form a 3-star.
13. Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 13, 6, and 3 forming the 3-star <12, (8, 13, 6)>.
14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 12, 1, 9, 7 forming the 3-star <13, (12, 1, 9)>.
15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 9 but it doesn't form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars are <2, (5, 1, 14)>, <3, (8, 12, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 12)>, and <8, (10, 12, 3)>.
