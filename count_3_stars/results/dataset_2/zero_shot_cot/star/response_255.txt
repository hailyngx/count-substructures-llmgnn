Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 1) (26, 3) (26, 12) (1, 26) (1, 21) (1, 18) (21, 1) (21, 8) (21, 29) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (27, 14) (27, 7) (27, 13) (27, 5) (3, 26) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 22) (22, 15) (23, 17) (23, 14) (20, 15) (20, 12) (20, 5) (17, 23) (17, 5) (29, 21) (29, 10) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 25) (7, 24) (7, 19) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 16) (8, 21) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 6) (14, 27) (14, 23) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 5) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 6) (24, 11) (12, 26) (12, 20) (12, 10) (16, 9) (16, 25) (16, 2) (11, 24) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 15) (10, 29) (10, 8) (10, 12) (5, 27) (5, 20) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 28) (13, 0) (13, 27) (2, 16) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. 
Nodes that have 3 incident edges are potential centers of 3-stars. 
Based on the given edges, the potential center nodes are: 9, 26, 1, 21, 0, 3, 15, 7, 5, 19, 27, 24, 12, 16, and 2.

Now, let's construct the 3-stars using these potential center nodes and count the total number of unique 3-stars.
After analyzing the graph, we find the following unique 3-stars:

<9, (26, 16, 0)>
<(26, 1, 3), 12>
<21, (1, 8, 29)>
<0, (9, 7, 13)>
<15, (3, 18, 20)>
<7, (0, 27, 25)>
<5, (27, 20, 17)>
<19, (9, 7, 8)>
<27, (14, 7, 13)>
<24, (7, 28, 6)>
<12, (26, 20, 10)>
<16, (9, 25, 2)>
<2, (16, 4)>
