Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 15) (8, 0) (8, 15) (9, 14) (9, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (1, 18) (1, 6) (17, 3) (17, 12) (3, 19) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 14) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (13, 0) (13, 16) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the given graph.

Based on the edges provided, the 3-stars can be listed as follows:
<2, (6, 10, 15)>
<5, (7, 11, 16)>
<18, (1, 7, 15)>
<0, (7, 8, 13)>
<7, (5, 15, 18)>
<8, (0, 15, 13)>
<9, (14, 19, 3)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [7].
