Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 12) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node has exactly three edges connected to it, forming a 3-star pattern.

From the given list of edges, here are the 3-stars that can be found in the graph:

<4, (2, 0, 14)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 11)>
<3, (9, 11, 13)>
<6, (8, 9, 11)>
<9, (6, 3, 12)>
<5, (10, 2, 13)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 14)>
<13, (0, 5, 14)>
<11, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (4, 1, 13)>
<10, (2, 0, 14)>
<14, (4, 8, 13)>
<12, (9, 0, 13)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [14] 3-stars.
