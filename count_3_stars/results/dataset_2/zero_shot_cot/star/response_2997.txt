Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to three other nodes:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 13, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 11.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 9, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 11, and 12.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, 9, and 13.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 10, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, 10, and 14.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 9.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<10, (2, 6, 13)>
<8, (1, 6, 11)>
<4, (0, 9, 12)>
<12, (0, 4, 11)>
<0, (3, 7, 12)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (6, 9, 14)>
<5, (2, 7, 14)>
<6, (2, 8, 14)>
<14, (2, 5, 6)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
