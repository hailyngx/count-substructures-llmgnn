Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 19) (17, 15) (17, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 10) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 10) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 8) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 12) (2, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 6) (12, 3) (12, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. A 3-star graph has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 9, and 16: <5, (7, 9, 16)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 13, and 18: <9, (5, 13, 18)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 12, and 15: <3, (11, 12, 15)>
4. Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 17: <15, (3, 8, 17)>
5. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 18: <11, (3, 8, 18)>
6. Node 0 does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 7 does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 1 does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 17 does not form a 3-star.
10. Node 13 does not form a 3-star.
11. Node 16 does not form a 3-star.
12. Node 18 does not form a 3-star.
13. Node 6 does not form a 3-star.
14. Node 19 does not form a 3-star.
15. Node 2 does not form a 3-star.
16. Node 4 does not form a 3-star.
17. Node 8 does not form a 3-star.
18. Node 12 does not form a 3-star.
19. Node 10 does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The number of 3-stars is [5]. 

The unique 3-stars are: <5, (7, 9, 16)>, <9, (5, 13, 18)>, <3, (11, 12, 15)>, <15, (3, 8, 17)>, <11, (3, 8, 18)>.
