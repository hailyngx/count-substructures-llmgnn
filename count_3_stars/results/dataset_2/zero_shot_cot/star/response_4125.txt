Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by identifying all unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (5, 6, 0)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (5, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
