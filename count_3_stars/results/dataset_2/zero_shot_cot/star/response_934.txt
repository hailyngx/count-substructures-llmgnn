Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 7) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 19) (11, 14) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 12) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 12) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 10) (19, 5) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 4) (16, 17) (16, 15) (16, 7) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 16) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 15) (1, 12) (1, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 12, 15)>
<1, (12, 18, 3)>
<2, (6, 0, 12)>
<3, (17, 12, 18)>
<4, (9, 10, 15)>
<5, (19, 7, 5)>
<6, (14, 2, 6)>
<7, (17, 5, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 18, 4)>
<10, (17, 4, 10)>
<11, (14, 11, 0)>
<13, (8, 13, 18)>
<16, (17, 16, 15)>
<19, (6, 19, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [14]
