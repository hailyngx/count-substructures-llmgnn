Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 2) (16, 17) (16, 4) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 4) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 12) (10, 14) (13, 2) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 6) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 5) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (19, 4) (19, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2) (4, 19) (9, 3) (9, 14) (7, 1) (7, 19) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 14) (6, 0) (6, 13) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 12) (18, 0) (18, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with exactly three neighbors connected by edges.

The nodes that have exactly three neighbors in the given graph are:  
Node 0: (3, 5, 6)  
Node 1: (7, 14, 15)  
Node 2: (3, 4, 11)  
Node 8: (5, 11, 12)  
Node 13: (6, 12, 17)  
Node 16: (4, 17, 19)  

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. We can see that there are 6 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (3, 5, 6)>  
<1, (7, 14, 15)>  
<2, (3, 4, 11)>  
<8, (5, 11, 12)>  
<13, (6, 12, 17)>  
<16, (4, 17, 19)>
