Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 10) (5, 11) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (4, 13) (4, 17) (18, 7) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (15, 13) (15, 17) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 19) (12, 2) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (17, 4) (17, 15) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 3) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 11 since the central node of a 3-star graph should have exactly three edges connected to it:
- Node 5 is directly connected to node 11.
- Node 9 is directly connected to node 11.
- Node 14 is directly connected to node 11.

Now, we can list the unique 3-star graphs:
<11, (5, 9, 14)>
<16, (1, 8, 10)>
<9, (2, 8, 10)>
<6, (1, 14, 0)>
<1, (16, 6, 2)>
<15, (13, 17, 4)>
<8, (16, 9, 0)>
<19, (13, 12, 0)>
<2, (9, 1, 3)>
<3, (8, 2, 13)>
<17, (4, 15, 13)>
<10, (16, 9, 14)>

Counting the number of 3-stars gives us a total of [12] unique 3-star graphs in the given graph.
