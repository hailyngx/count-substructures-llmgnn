Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 14) (4, 8) (4, 9) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 8) (17, 13) (17, 2) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (0, 6) (0, 5) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 2) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (16, 3) (16, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 10) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 10) (12, 13) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 11) (18, 12) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 2) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1: (1, 7, 9), (1, 6, 10)
2. Node 2: (2, 17, 19), (2, 11, 10)
3. Node 3: (3, 15, 14), (3, 11, 16)
4. Node 4: (4, 8, 9)
5. Node 5: (5, 0, 19)
6. Node 6: (6, 7, 9), (6, 1, 10), (6, 0, 13)
7. Node 7: (7, 15, 6), (7, 1, 10)
8. Node 8: (8, 4, 14)
9. Node 9: (9, 4, 6), (9, 1, 10)
10. Node 10: (10, 19, 2), (10, 1, 2)
11. Node 11: (11, 3, 16), (11, 2, 18)
12. Node 12: (12, 13, 18)
13. Node 13: (13, 6, 17)
14. Node 14: (14, 3, 15), (14, 8, 18)
15. Node 15: (15, 3, 14), (15, 7, 14)
16. Node 16: (16, 3, 1)
17. Node 17: (17, 13, 2)
18. Node 18: (18, 8, 12), (18, 11, 12)
19. Node 19: (19, 5, 10), (19, 2, 10)

Therefore, there are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
