Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 23) (16, 4) (16, 20) (9, 25) (9, 2) (26, 15) (26, 8) (26, 6) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 28) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 29) (18, 21) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 25) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 1) (22, 8) (2, 9) (2, 18) (12, 4) (12, 7) (8, 26) (8, 22) (8, 24) (8, 20) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 5) (6, 26) (6, 21) (6, 10) (6, 27) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 6) (1, 22) (3, 28) (3, 24) (3, 20) (3, 13) (28, 4) (28, 22) (28, 3) (28, 5) (17, 11) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 18) (25, 19) (5, 14) (5, 28) (5, 20) (23, 16) (23, 29) (15, 26) (27, 6) (27, 29) (29, 21) (29, 18) (29, 23) (29, 27) (29, 24) (24, 8) (24, 3) (24, 17) (24, 29) (24, 13) (19, 11) (19, 25) (20, 16) (20, 8) (20, 3) (20, 5) (13, 3) (13, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:
- Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 16), (4, 12), (4, 28) --> <4, (16, 12, 28)>
- Node 7 has 4 edges: (7, 21), (7, 12), (7, 0), (7, 10) --> <7, (21, 12, 0)>
- Node 18 has 5 edges: (18, 21), (18, 22), (18, 2), (18, 25), (18, 29) --> <18, (21, 22, 2)>
- Node 22 has 4 edges: (22, 18), (22, 28), (22, 1), (22, 8) --> <22, (18, 28, 1)>
- Node 28 has 4 edges: (28, 4), (28, 22), (28, 3), (28, 5) --> <28, (4, 22, 3)>
- Node 29 has 5 edges: (29, 21), (29, 18), (29, 23), (29, 27), (29, 24) --> <29, (21, 18, 23)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars found:
- There are 5 unique 3-stars based on the patterns identified.
