Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 9) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by finding the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Given the graph information, we can find the 3-stars as follows:

<4, (7, 1, 13)>
<7, (0, 11, 4)>
<1, (0, 8, 14)>
<3, (5, 2, 12)>
<8, (1, 13, 6)>
<13, (4, 8, 11)>
<5, (4, 3, 2)>
<6, (8, 13, 10)>
<0, (7, 1, 11)>
<11, (7, 13, 0)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<14, (4, 1, 9)>
<9, (4, 11, 2)>
<10, (8, 2, 14)>
<12, (3, 0, 11)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 15 unique 3-stars in total. 
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
