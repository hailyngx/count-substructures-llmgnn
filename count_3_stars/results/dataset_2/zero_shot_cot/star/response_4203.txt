Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 9
- Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 9)> 
- Node 2: None (as it needs three connections to form a 3-star)
- Node 3: <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 4: None
- Node 5: <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 6: None
- Node 7: None
- Node 8: None
- Node 9: <9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, and <9, (0, 1, 6)>.
