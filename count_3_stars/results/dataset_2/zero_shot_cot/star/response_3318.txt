Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 16) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (17, 0) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 18) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (12, 3) (16, 4) (16, 10) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 18) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a center node connected to three other nodes.

The list of 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (2, 5, 15)>
<1, (5, 13, 19)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 7, 10)>
<4, (16, 19, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 17)>
<7, (3, 10, 11)>
<8, (2, 9, 18)>
<9, (2, 8, 11)>
<10, (3, 7, 16)>
<11, (7, 9, 10)>
<13, (1, 14, 19)>
<14, (8, 13, 14)>
<15, (0, 18, 15)>
<16, (4, 10, 16)>
<17, (1, 0, 5)>
<18, (0, 8, 15)>
<19, (1, 4, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
