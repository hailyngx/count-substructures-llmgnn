Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Upon examining the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 7, 10)>
<9, (6, 1, 0)>
<8, (6, 13, 14)>
<13, (8, 1, 2)>
<7, (6, 8, 12)>
<12, (7, 11, 5)>
<3, (11, 2, 0)>
<11, (12, 3, 4)>
<1, (9, 13, 5)>
<2, (13, 3, 14)>
<14, (9, 8, 2)>
<0, (9, 3, 5)>
<5, (7, 3, 1)>
<10, (6, 9, 8)>
<4, (3, 11, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
