Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 10) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 19) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 19) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 16) (0, 13) (0, 4) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 19) (18, 5) (18, 11) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 18) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 13, 14)>
<3, (2, 7, 15)>
<4, (0, 8, 11)>
<5, (10, 11, 18)>
<6, (9, 17, 19)>
<13, (1, 8, 0)>
<15, (3, 10, 16)>
<16, (3, 10, 19)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
