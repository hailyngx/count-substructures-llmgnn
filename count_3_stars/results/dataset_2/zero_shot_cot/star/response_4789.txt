Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes connected to the center node in the graph:
- Node 23 has edges with nodes 26, 14, 28, 19
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 18, 9, 11
- Node 18 has edges with nodes 4, 9, 17
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 26, 25
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 18, 19, 24, 10
- Node 21 has edges with nodes 19, 24
- Node 28 has edges with nodes 23, 9, 14, 25
- Node 27 has edges with nodes 22, 11
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 0, 6
- Node 25 has edges with nodes 18, 1, 28, 14
- Node 15 has edges with nodes 19, 13, 16
- Node 17 has edges with nodes 22, 18, 20
- Node 20 has edges with nodes 17, 6
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 7, 29, 9
- Node 16 has edges with nodes 15, 12, 24
- Node 11 has edges with nodes 2, 27, 14
- Node 12 has edges with nodes 16, 29, 8
- Node 10 has edges with nodes 26, 4
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 2, 18, 28, 0, 13
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 7, 20
- Node 24 has edges with nodes 4, 21, 16, 5, 19
- Node 29 has edges with nodes 0, 12, 3
- Node 19 has edges with nodes 23, 4, 21, 15, 24
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 29
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 12
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 14, 24
- Node 13 has edges with nodes 15, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Nodes 2, 18, and 9 form a 3-star <2, (18, 9, 11)>
- Nodes 4, 18, and 9 form a 3-star <4, (18, 9, 10)>
- Nodes 7, 0, and 9 form a 3-star <7, (0, 6, 9)>
- Nodes 16, 15, and 19 form a 3-star <16, (15, 19, 24)>
- Nodes 16, 24, and 5 form a 3-star <16, (24, 5, 14)>
- Nodes 18, 17, and 20 form a 3-star <18, (17, 20, 6)>
- Nodes 18, 25, and 1 form a 3-star <18, (25, 1, 26)>
- Nodes 18, 25, and 28 form a 3-star <18, (25, 28, 23)>
- Nodes 19, 23, and 26 form a 3-star <19, (23, 26, 10)>
- Nodes 19, 24, and 21 form a 3-star <19, (24, 21, 15)>
- Nodes 19, 24, and 5 form a 3-star <19, (24, 5, 14)>
- Nodes 19, 24, and 16 form a 3-star <19, (24, 16, 12)>
- Nodes 19, 24, and 4 form a 3-star <19, (24, 4, 21)>
- Nodes 19, 24, and 21 form a 3-star <19, (24, 21, 15)>
- Nodes 25, 18, and 17 form a 3-star <25, (18, 17, 22)>
- Nodes 25, 14, and 23 form a 3-star <25, (14, 23, 26)>
- Nodes 25, 14, and 28 form a 3-star <25, (14, 28, 23)>
- Nodes 28, 23, and 26 form a 3-star <28, (23, 26, 10)>
- Nodes 28, 23, and 14 form a 3-star <28, (23, 14, 11)>
- Nodes 28, 23, and 19 form a 3-star <28, (23, 19, 24)>
- Nodes 29, 0, and 7 form a 3-star <29, (0, 7, 6)>
- Nodes 29, 12, and 16 form a 3-star <29, (12, 16, 15)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [19]
