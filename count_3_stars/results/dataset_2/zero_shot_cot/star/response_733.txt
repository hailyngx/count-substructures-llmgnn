Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 8) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 13) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's find all occurrences of the 3-star structure.

Upon examining the edges, we find the following 3-stars:

<5, (9, 2, 11)>
<8, (11, 0, 6)>
<13, (12, 4, 1)>
<10, (13, 1, 2)>
<6, (8, 14, 7)>
<0, (8, 14, 12)>
<14, (6, 0, 3)>
<7, (8, 6, 1)>

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
