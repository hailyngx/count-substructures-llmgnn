Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify sets of four nodes where one node is connected to the other three nodes directly. In this case, we are looking for nodes that form a central node and three leaves.

First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7)
   <9, (5, 6, 2)>  [1]  (central node 9 with leaves 5, 6, 2)
   <9, (5, 3, 1)>  [2]  (central node 9 with leaves 5, 3, 1)
   <9, (6, 7, 2)>  [3]  (central node 9 with leaves 6, 7, 2)

2. Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 2), (4, 1)
   <4, (7, 8, 2)>  [4]  (central node 4 with leaves 7, 8, 2)
   <4, (7, 1, 8)>  [5]  (central node 4 with leaves 7, 1, 8)

3. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 6)
   <7, (9, 4, 6)>  [6]  (central node 7 with leaves 9, 4, 6)

4. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 0)
   <6, (9, 7, 8)>  [7]  (central node 6 with leaves 9, 7, 8)

5. Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 1)
   <8, (4, 6, 3)>  [8]  (central node 8 with leaves 4, 6, 3)
   <8, (4, 2, 1)>  [9]  (central node 8 with leaves 4, 2, 1)
   <8, (6, 0, 3)>  [10] (central node 8 with leaves 6, 0, 3)

6. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 3), (2, 0)
   <2, (9, 4, 8)>  [11] (central node 2 with leaves 9, 4, 8)
   <2, (9, 3, 0)>  [12] (central node 2 with leaves 9, 3, 0)

7. Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 0)
   <1, (9, 4, 0)>  [13] (central node 1 with leaves 9, 4, 0)

8. Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 2)
   <3, (9, 8, 2)>  [14] (central node 3 with leaves 9, 8, 2)

9. Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 8), (0, 2), (0, 1)
   <0, (6, 8, 2)>  [15] (central node 0 with leaves 6, 8, 2)
   <0, (6, 2, 1)>  [16] (central node 0 with leaves 6, 2, 1)

Count of 3-stars: [16]
