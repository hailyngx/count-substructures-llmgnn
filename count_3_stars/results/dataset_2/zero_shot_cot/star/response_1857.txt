Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

Let's list all possible 3-stars based on the given edges:
<0, (5, 7, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 6)>
<2, (9, 0, 8)>
<3, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (8, 3, 0)>
<5, (1, 7, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 0)>
<7, (5, 3, 0)>
<8, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>

As we can see, there are 10 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
