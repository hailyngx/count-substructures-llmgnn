Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 11) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 18) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 8) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 11) (17, 15) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 12) (19, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (6, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 3) (10, 9) (16, 15) (16, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (12, 19) (12, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2: (18, 9, 7)
- Node 18: (2, 4, 11)
- Node 4: (18, 9, 14)
- Node 3: (11, 0, 7)
- Node 11: (18, 3, 7)
- Node 1: (15, 5, 8)
- Node 15: (1, 17, 16)
- Node 8: (1, 19, 16)
- Node 19: (2, 8, 12)
- Node 7: (2, 3, 11)
- Node 0: (2, 3, 12)
- Node 14: (4, 3)
- Node 9: (2, 4, 19)
- Node 10: (3, 9)
- Node 16: (15, 8)
- Node 5: (1, 0)
- Node 12: (19, 0)

Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars:
<2, (18, 9, 7)>
<18, (2, 4, 11)>
<4, (18, 9, 14)>
<3, (11, 0, 7)>
<11, (18, 3, 7)>
<1, (15, 5, 8)>
<15, (1, 17, 16)>
<8, (1, 19, 16)>
<19, (2, 8, 12)>
<7, (2, 3, 11)>
<0, (2, 3, 12)>
<14, (4, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 19)>
<10, (3, 9)>
<16, (15, 8)>
<5, (1, 0)>
<12, (19, 0)>

Total number of 3-stars: [17]
