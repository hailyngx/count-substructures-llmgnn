Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 16) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 13) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0: 17, 7, 10
- Node 1: 13
- Node 2: 17, 4, 10
- Node 3: 9, 5
- Node 4: 8, 2, 13, 10
- Node 5: 3, 17, 19, 12
- Node 6: 8, 16, 10, 18
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 14, 4, 6
- Node 9: 3, 7, 16, 12
- Node 10: 4, 0, 6, 2
- Node 11: 19, 13
- Node 12: 5, 9
- Node 13: 4, 11, 1
- Node 14: 15, 17, 8
- Node 15: 19, 16, 14
- Node 16: 15, 9, 6
- Node 17: 0, 5, 14, 2
- Node 18: 19, 6
- Node 19: 15, 5, 18, 11

Next, let's list out the possible 3-stars:

<0, (17, 7, 10)>
<1, (13, 11, 1)>
<2, (17, 4, 10)>
<3, (9, 5, 12)>
<4, (8, 13, 10)>
<5, (17, 19, 12)>
<6, (8, 16, 18)>
<7, (9, 16, 12)>
<8, (14, 4, 6)>
<9, (7, 16, 12)>
<10, (0, 6, 4)>
<11, (19, 13, 1)>
<12, (5, 9, 3)>
<13, (11, 1, 4)>
<14, (15, 17, 8)>
<15, (16, 14, 19)>
<16, (6, 14, 15)>
<17, (14, 8, 2)>
<18, (19, 6, 5)>
<19, (15, 18, 11)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [20]
