Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 9) (10, 18) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 4) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 10) (18, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 5) (14, 9) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (1, 18) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 11, 15, 12
- Node 1: connected to nodes 18, 4
- Node 2: connected to nodes 5, 17, 9, 7
- Node 3: connected to nodes 16, 6
- Node 4: connected to nodes 6, 15, 9, 1
- Node 5: connected to nodes 6, 19, 2, 12, 14
- Node 7: connected to nodes 13, 19, 17, 2
- Node 8: connected to nodes 13, 15, 12
- Node 9: connected to nodes 16, 4, 2, 14
- Node 13: connected to nodes 16, 8, 17, 7
- Node 15: connected to nodes 8, 0, 4
- Node 16: connected to nodes 11, 13, 3, 9

Now, we can identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (11, 15, 12)>
<1, (18, 4, 9)>
<2, (5, 17, 9)>
<3, (16, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 15, 4)>
<5, (6, 19, 2)>
<7, (13, 19, 17)>
<8, (13, 15, 8)>
<13, (16, 8, 17)>
<15, (8, 0, 12)>
<16, (11, 13, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
