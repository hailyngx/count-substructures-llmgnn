Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we will first list out all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 6, 5)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<4, (8, 7, 2)>
<5, (7, 1, 8)>
<6, (7, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 5)>
<8, (5, 7, 4)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
