Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (4, 1, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 7, 2)>
<5, (8, 1, 0)>
<6, (7, 8, -)>
<7, (4, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, 3)>

By counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in total.
