Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 7) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 28) (27, 0) (27, 21) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 1) (7, 22) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 25) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 26) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 24) (26, 4) (26, 25) (26, 16) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 21) (19, 4) (19, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 21) (9, 15) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 18) (1, 14) (1, 29) (3, 2) (3, 28) (3, 23) (28, 15) (28, 0) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 20) (29, 18) (29, 1) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 20) (21, 11) (20, 28) (20, 21) (16, 26) (16, 8) (16, 9) (24, 14) (24, 25) (25, 12) (25, 26) (25, 24) (17, 18) (17, 4) (23, 9) (23, 3) (23, 10) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 23) (11, 8) (11, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique occurrences where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (27, 9, 28)>
<1, (14, 18, 29)>
<2, (7, 5, 3)>
<3, (2, 28, 23)>
<4, (22, 18, 19)>
<5, (22, 7, 19)>
<7, (22, 2, 12)>
<8, (16, 21, 11)>
<9, (15, 0, 16)>
<10, (28, 22, 23)>
<12, (7, 25, 26)>
<14, (15, 1, 24)>
<15, (9, 14, 28)>
<16, (8, 26, 9)>
<18, (29, 4, 17)>
<19, (5, 4, 26)>
<21, (27, 5, 11)>
<22, (4, 7, 10)>
<23, (9, 3, 10)>
<24, (14, 25, 26)>
<25, (12, 24, 26)>
<26, (4, 16, 25)>
<28, (0, 15, 10)>
<29, (1, 18, 17)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars identified above and provide the final answer:
[23]
