Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 15) (10, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (6, 17) (6, 12) (3, 16) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 4) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 2) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 18) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 4) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 18) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 9) (7, 11) (7, 16) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 1) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 13) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 9) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 19) (14, 5) (14, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) 

Response:
