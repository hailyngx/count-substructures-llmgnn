Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 24) (0, 28) (0, 5) (0, 19) (27, 3) (27, 25) (27, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 10) (22, 23) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 28) (20, 6) (20, 9) (20, 25) (25, 27) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 29) (25, 24) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 8) (7, 12) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 21) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 24) (8, 18) (8, 24) (8, 29) (8, 16) (16, 12) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 2) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 10) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 17) (2, 16) (2, 26) (2, 1) (26, 7) (26, 11) (26, 2) (26, 17) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (28, 0) (28, 23) (24, 15) (24, 25) (24, 21) (24, 8) (4, 19) (4, 17) (29, 25) (29, 8) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 1) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 1) (17, 23) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (5, 19, 28)>
2. <1, (14, 10, 1)>
3. <2, (16, 26, 2)>
4. <3, (5, 15, 27)>
5. <4, (17, 19, 4)>
6. <6, (9, 15, 20)>
7. <7, (12, 26, 7)>
8. <8, (16, 24, 8)>
9. <11, (17, 26, 11)>
10. <14, (1, 15, 27)>
11. <17, (4, 11, 17)>
12. <18, (8, 14, 18)>
13. <20, (6, 9, 25)>
14. <21, (5, 16, 24)>
15. <22, (23, 25, 22)>
16. <23, (17, 22, 28)>
17. <25, (20, 24, 29)>
18. <26, (2, 7, 11)>
19. <27, (3, 14, 15)>
20. <29, (8, 25, 29)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 20.]
