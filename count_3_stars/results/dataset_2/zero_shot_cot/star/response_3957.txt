Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given data:

<0, (4, 11, 12)>
<1, (8, 10, 12)>
<2, (5, 6, 11)>
<3, (9, 10, 13)>
<5, (2, 10, 12)>
<6, (7, 8, 12)>
<11, (2, 8, 10)>
<12, (5, 6, 0)>
<14, (5, 9, 11)>

Count of 3-star graphs: [9]
