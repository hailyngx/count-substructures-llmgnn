Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 27) (9, 21) (9, 24) (18, 20) (18, 29) (18, 13) (22, 2) (22, 12) (22, 3) (14, 17) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 25) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 1) (0, 15) (0, 5) (11, 1) (11, 21) (28, 8) (28, 5) (28, 23) (21, 9) (21, 11) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 23) (25, 4) (25, 15) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 16) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 10) (13, 18) (13, 29) (13, 19) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 3) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 27) (2, 24) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 27) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (20, 18) (20, 26) (20, 19) (20, 5) (26, 8) (26, 20) (26, 29) (23, 28) (23, 7) (23, 2) (23, 3) (29, 18) (29, 13) (29, 26) (27, 6) (27, 2) (27, 24) (27, 19) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 27) (3, 22) (3, 16) (3, 23) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 28) (5, 10) (5, 20) (12, 22) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. We are looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. As every 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, let's list them.

<1, (4, 8, 11)>
<2, (22, 23, 27)>
<3, (16, 22, 23)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 10)>
<7, (16, 19, 23)>
<8, (1, 4, 17)>
<13, (18, 19, 29)>
<15, (0, 10, 25)>
<16, (3, 7, 10)>
<18, (13, 20, 29)>
<19, (7, 13, 27)>
<20, (5, 19, 26)>
<22, (2, 12, 3)>
<23, (2, 3, 7)>
<24, (2, 27, 9)>
<26, (20, 26, 29)>
<27, (2, 19, 24)>
<28, (5, 8, 23)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars.
