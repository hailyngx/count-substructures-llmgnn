Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 24) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 27) (18, 11) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 20) (18, 1) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 4) (22, 17) (2, 18) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 27) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 14) (26, 22) (26, 12) (28, 11) (28, 13) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 19) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 25) (17, 22) (0, 21) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 23) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 22) (4, 10) (8, 21) (8, 7) (12, 26) (12, 21) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (24, 11) (24, 15) (15, 7) (15, 24) (15, 19) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 25) (14, 29) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 23) (14, 5) (27, 9) (27, 2) (20, 9) (20, 18) (21, 0) (21, 8) (21, 12) (25, 13) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 5) (23, 2) (23, 10) (23, 14) (5, 14) (5, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<11, (16, 28, 24)>
<11, (16, 28, 18)>
<11, (16, 28, 4)>
<11, (16, 28, 13)>
<11, (16, 28, 19)>
<11, (16, 4, 22)>
<11, (16, 4, 10)>
<11, (16, 4, 14)>
<11, (16, 4, 27)>
<16, (11, 4, 22)>
<16, (11, 4, 10)>
<16, (11, 4, 14)>
<16, (11, 4, 27)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>
<9, (6, 3, 27)>
<9, (6, 19, 13)>
<18, (11, 22, 1)>
<18, (11, 22, 20)>
<18, (11, 22, 27)>
<22, (18, 26, 17)>
<2, (18, 29, 23)>
<29, (2, 14, 5)>
<28, (11, 13, 19)>
<13, (28, 25, 19)>
<1, (9, 25, 5)>
<0, (21, 8, 12)>
<10, (2, 4, 23)>
<4, (16, 22, 10)>
<7, (3, 15, 14)>
<24, (11, 15, 19)>
<15, (7, 24, 19)>
<19, (6, 13, 25)>
<14, (29, 3, 23)>
<27, (9, 2, 20)>
<20, (18, 1, 9)>
<21, (0, 8, 12)>
<25, (13, 1, 5)>
<23, (2, 10, 14)>
<5, (14, 25, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
The total number of 3-stars is [32].
