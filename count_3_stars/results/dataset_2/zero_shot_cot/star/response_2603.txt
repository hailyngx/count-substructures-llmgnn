Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Observations:
- Nodes 5, 9, 1, 8, 3, 13, 6, and 14 have 4 edges each.
- Nodes 4, 7, and 2 have 5 edges each.
- Nodes 11 and 10 have 3 edges each.
- Node 0 has only 1 edge.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<5, (9, 8, 12)>
<9, (5, 14, 12)>
<1, (4, 8, 10)>
<8, (9, 5, 13)>
<3, (7, 6, 13)>
<13, (3, 8, 10)>
<6, (3, 2, 12)>
<14, (9, 7, 2)>
<4, (1, 7, 11)>
<7, (4, 3, 14)>
<2, (4, 3, 14)>

[There are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
