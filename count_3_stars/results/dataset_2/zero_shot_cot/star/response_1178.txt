Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 21) (27, 15) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 8) (17, 22) (17, 8) (17, 2) (20, 1) (20, 12) (20, 2) (20, 16) (25, 6) (25, 21) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 29) (11, 10) (11, 24) (12, 20) (12, 18) (12, 19) (28, 22) (28, 18) (28, 23) (29, 10) (29, 24) (4, 22) (4, 16) (4, 2) (18, 12) (18, 28) (18, 6) (18, 13) (13, 18) (13, 7) (26, 14) (26, 8) (5, 1) (5, 24) (5, 21) (2, 17) (2, 20) (2, 4) (2, 23) (22, 17) (22, 28) (22, 4) (22, 6) (0, 10) (0, 9) (24, 11) (24, 29) (24, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 13) (7, 3) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 9) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 22) (16, 20) (16, 4) (16, 8) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 26) (8, 16) (8, 1) (23, 28) (23, 2) (23, 7) (23, 21) (21, 15) (21, 25) (21, 5) (21, 23) (19, 12) (19, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the given edges, the 3-stars can be represented as follows:
<0, (10, 9, 11)>
<1, (5, 8, 20)>
<2, (4, 17, 20)>
<3, (7, 9, 23)>
<4, (2, 16, 22)>
<5, (1, 21, 24)>
<6, (6, 18, 25)>
<7, (3, 9, 13)>
<8, (1, 16, 26)>
<9, (0, 7, 10)>
<10, (0, 11, 29)>
<11, (9, 10, 24)>
<12, (18, 19, 20)>
<13, (7, 18, 23)>
<14, (8, 15, 26)>
<15, (14, 21, 27)>
<16, (2, 4, 8)>
<17, (2, 8, 22)>
<18, (4, 12, 28)>
<19, (7, 12, 19)>
<20, (1, 12, 20)>
<21, (5, 15, 21)>
<22, (4, 6, 22)>
<23, (3, 7, 21)>
<24, (5, 11, 29)>
<25, (6, 21, 25)>
<26, (8, 14, 15)>
<27, (15, 27, 0)>
<28, (12, 18, 23)>
<29, (10, 24, 29)>

Count of 3-stars: [29]
