Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 9) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 6) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

- Node 8 has 5 connections: 13, 5, 14, 3, 7
  - <8, (13, 5, 14)>
  - <8, (5, 3, 7)>

- Node 13 has 5 connections: 8, 5, 10, 1, 4
  - <13, (8, 5, 10)>
  - <13, (5, 1, 4)>

- Node 10 has 5 connections: 13, 11, 6, 7, 4
  - <10, (13, 11, 6)>
  - <10, (11, 7, 4)>

- Node 11 has 4 connections: 10, 9, 12, 4
  - <11, (10, 9, 12)>

- Node 7 has 5 connections: 8, 10, 12, 9, 5
  - <7, (8, 10, 12)>
  - <7, (10, 9, 5)>

- Node 12 has 5 connections: 11, 7, 0, 1, 9
  - <12, (11, 7, 0)>
  - <12, (7, 9, 1)>

- Node 0 has 3 connections: 12, 3, 9
  - <0, (12, 3, 9)>

- Node 2 has 3 connections: 5, 14, 4
  - <2, (5, 14, 4)>

- Node 3 has 2 connections: 8, 0

- Node 6 has 2 connections: 10, 14

- Node 14 has 3 connections: 8, 2, 6

- Node 1 has 4 connections: 13, 12, 5, 4
  - <1, (13, 12, 5)>

- Node 9 has 4 connections: 11, 7, 12, 0
  - <9, (11, 7, 12)>

- Node 4 has 5 connections: 10, 11, 2, 5, 1
  - <4, (10, 11, 2)>
  - <4, (11, 5, 1)>

- Node 5 has 5 connections: 8, 13, 7, 2, 1
  - <5, (8, 13, 7)>
  - <5, (13, 2, 1)>

Therefore, there are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [12].
