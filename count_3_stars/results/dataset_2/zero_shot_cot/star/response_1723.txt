Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that act as the center of a 3-star graph. To do this, we need to find nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. 

- The nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 1, 7, 0.
  
Now, let's list the 3-stars based on these central nodes:

<1, (4, 8, 2)>
<7, (8, 2, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 1)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

There are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
