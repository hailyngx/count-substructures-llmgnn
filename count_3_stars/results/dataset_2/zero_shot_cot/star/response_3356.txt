Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 27) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 28) (27, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 16) (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 6) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 12) (20, 25) (20, 0) (20, 2) (25, 17) (25, 20) (0, 15) (0, 20) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 6) (22, 2) (22, 16) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 12) (28, 15) (28, 16) (28, 8) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 11) (8, 28) (2, 14) (2, 20) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 4) (18, 11) (18, 7) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 6) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 23) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 4) (23, 9) (23, 12) (23, 5) (23, 29) (7, 18) (7, 13) (29, 23) (1, 2) (1, 4) (21, 27) (21, 19) (3, 26) (3, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (15, 27, 20)>
<2, (14, 4, 20)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (10, 0, 23)>
<6, (17, 0, 24)>
<8, (9, 15, 28)>
<11, (10, 18, 12)>
<16, (27, 22, 28)>
<19, (26, 21, 6)>
<23, (9, 5, 29)>
<26, (9, 19, 3)>

So, there are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [11]
