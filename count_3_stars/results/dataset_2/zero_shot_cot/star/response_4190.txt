Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 12) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 2) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 2) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that make up each 3-star in the graph. 

Next, based on the definition of a 3-star graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars in the graph.

Let's go through the nodes and determine the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 edges: (4, 0), (10, 0), (0, 12), (0, 6)
- Node 1 has 3 edges: (7, 1), (13, 1), (1, 5)
- Node 2 has 4 edges: (13, 2), (3, 2), (6, 2), (2, 14)
- Node 3 has 3 edges: (13, 3), (3, 11), (3, 2)
- Node 4 has 3 edges: (4, 7), (4, 0), (4, 5)
- Node 5 has 4 edges: (5, 4), (5, 11), (5, 12), (1, 5)
- Node 6 has 5 edges: (6, 7), (6, 13), (6, 0), (6, 14), (2, 6)
- Node 7 has 4 edges: (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 14), (7, 1)
- Node 8 has 4 edges: (8, 13), (8, 14), (8, 10), (8, 12)
- Node 9 has 3 edges: (9, 10), (9, 11), (9, 12)
- Node 10 has 4 edges: (10, 8), (10, 11), (10, 0), (10, 9)
- Node 11 has 4 edges: (11, 10), (11, 3), (11, 9), (11, 5)
- Node 12 has 5 edges: (12, 8), (12, 11), (12, 5), (12, 0), (12, 9)
- Node 13 has 5 edges: (13, 8), (13, 2), (13, 1), (13, 3), (13, 6)
- Node 14 has 4 edges: (14, 7), (14, 8), (14, 6), (14, 2)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (4, 10, 6)>
<1, (7, 13, 5)>
<2, (13, 3, 6)>
<4, (7, 0, 5)>
<5, (4, 11, 12)>
<7, (4, 6, 14)>
<8, (13, 14, 10)>
<10, (8, 11, 0)>
<12, (8, 11, 5)>
<13, (8, 2, 6)>
<14, (7, 8, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
