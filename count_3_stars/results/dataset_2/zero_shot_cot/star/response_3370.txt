Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

First, let's list all nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 3
- Node 1: 7, 3, 2
- Node 2: 6, 1, 8, 4, 3
- Node 3: 5, 9, 1, 0, 2
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 8, 2
- Node 5: 9, 4, 3, 7
- Node 6: 7, 2, 4, 0
- Node 7: 5, 9, 6, 4, 0, 1
- Node 8: 4, 2
- Node 9: 5, 3, 7

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 4, 7)>
- <9, (5, 3, 7)>
- <3, (5, 9, 1)>
- <2, (6, 1, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <7, (6, 4, 0)>
- <1, (7, 3, 2)>
- <6, (7, 2, 4)>
- <0, (6, 7, 3)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
