Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 23) (18, 26) (22, 14) (22, 28) (3, 17) (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 12) (25, 10) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 12) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 19) (20, 11) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 28) (1, 27) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 4) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 28) (6, 21) (6, 13) (21, 6) (21, 24) (15, 14) (15, 1) (15, 8) (9, 29) (9, 4) (9, 2) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 12) (5, 26) (5, 29) (5, 8) (5, 27) (12, 25) (12, 0) (12, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 5) (16, 17) (16, 23) (16, 10) (10, 25) (10, 16) (7, 3) (7, 20) (7, 23) (11, 20) (11, 29) (27, 1) (27, 5) (4, 3) (4, 26) (4, 9) (4, 13) (24, 0) (24, 21) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 23) (28, 22) (28, 1) (28, 19) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 7) (23, 13) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with exactly three edges, which are potential central nodes in 3-stars.
- Node 14 has 3 edges: (14, 17), (14, 22), (14, 15)
- Node 17 has 3 edges: (17, 14), (17, 3), (17, 16)
- Node 22 has 2 edges.
- Node 18 has 1 edge.
- Node 26 has 3 edges: (26, 18), (26, 5), (26, 4)
- Node 19 has 3 edges: (19, 20), (19, 8), (19, 28)
- Node 21 has 2 edges.
- Node 15 has 3 edges: (15, 14), (15, 1), (15, 8)
- Node 1 has 3 edges: (1, 15), (1, 2), (1, 28)
- Node 16 has 3 edges: (16, 17), (16, 23), (16, 10)
- Node 10 has 2 edges.
- Node 7 has 3 edges: (7, 3), (7, 20), (7, 23)
- Node 13 has 3 edges: (13, 6), (13, 4), (13, 23)
- Node 28 has 3 edges: (28, 22), (28, 1), (28, 19)
- Node 23 has 4 edges.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 22, and 15. <14, (17, 22, 15)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 3, and 16. <17, (14, 3, 16)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 5, and 4. <26, (18, 5, 4)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 20, 8, and 28. <19, (20, 8, 28)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 1, and 8. <15, (14, 1, 8)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 2, and 28. <1, (15, 2, 28)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 23, and 10. <16, (17, 23, 10)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 20, and 23. <7, (3, 20, 23)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 23. <13, (6, 4, 23)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 1, and 19. <28, (22, 1, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
