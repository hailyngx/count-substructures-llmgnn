Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 20) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 0) (18, 29) (15, 8) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 24) (20, 13) (20, 15) (20, 1) (17, 27) (29, 18) (19, 15) (19, 26) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 7) (6, 10) (6, 22) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 23) (0, 8) (0, 18) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 16) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 10) (11, 2) (11, 26) (11, 23) (23, 26) (23, 28) (23, 11) (23, 16) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 26) (16, 7) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 12) (1, 2) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 4) (27, 17) (27, 24) (27, 14) (3, 24) (14, 4) (14, 27) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 15) (24, 27) (24, 3) (10, 5) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (22, 6) (22, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 10: (5, 10), (28, 10), (19, 10), (6, 10), (25, 10)
   - Node 15: (8, 15), (20, 15), (19, 15), (24, 15)
   - Node 16: (26, 16), (7, 16), (25, 16), (23, 16), (12, 16)
   - Node 18: (2, 18), (18, 24), (18, 0), (29, 18)
   - Node 24: (8, 24), (18, 24), (15, 24), (27, 24), (3, 24)

2. Unique 3-stars found:
   - <10, (5, 28, 19)>
   - <15, (8, 20, 19)>
   - <16, (26, 7, 25)>
   - <18, (2, 0, 29)>
   - <24, (8, 15, 3)>

3. Count of 3-stars: [5]
