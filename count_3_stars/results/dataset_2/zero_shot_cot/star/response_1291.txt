Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 14) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Find all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 13), (5, 12)
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 10)
- Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 10)
- Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 6)
- Node 12: (12, 5), (12, 8), (12, 13)
- Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 12), (13, 2)

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- From node 5: <5, (6, 12, 13)>
- From node 6: <6, (5, 8, 10)>
- From node 7: <7, (0, 3, 10)>
- From node 8: <8, (4, 6, 12)>
- From node 12: <12, (5, 8, 13)>
- From node 13: <13, (5, 12, 2)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars:
There are 6 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
