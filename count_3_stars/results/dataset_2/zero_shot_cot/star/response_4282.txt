Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, as these nodes could be centers of 3-star graphs. Based on the given edges, we find that nodes 5, 4, 9, 7, 1, and 0 satisfy this criterion.

Next, let's analyze each of these potential centers to identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. For node 5:
   - Neighbors: 6, 8, 4
   - Since it has 3 neighbors, we have a 3-star with center at 5: <5, (6, 8, 4)>

2. For node 4:
   - Neighbors: 5, 9, 7, 1
   - Since it has 4 neighbors, it doesn't form a 3-star as a center.

3. For node 9:
   - Neighbors: 5, 4, 2, 3, 7
   - Since it has 5 neighbors, it doesn't form a 3-star as a center.

4. For node 7:
   - Neighbors: 9, 4, 0, 3, 2
   - Since it has 5 neighbors, it doesn't form a 3-star as a center.

5. For node 1:
   - Neighbors: 4, 3, 6, 0
   - Since it has 4 neighbors, it doesn't form a 3-star as a center.

6. For node 0:
   - Neighbors: 7, 1, 3, 6, 8
   - Since it has 5 neighbors, it doesn't form a 3-star as a center.

Therefore, the only 3-star in this graph is <5, (6, 8, 4)>.
Thus, the final answer is [1].
