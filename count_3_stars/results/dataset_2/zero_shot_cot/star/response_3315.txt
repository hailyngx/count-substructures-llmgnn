Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, let's start by identifying the nodes that form 3-stars. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

We can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<9, (6, 11, 1)>
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (1, 0, 10)>
<4, (8, 12, 2)>
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<2, (6, 4, 8)>
<11, (9, 4, 7)>
<0, (9, 3, 2)>
<7, (2, 11, 14)>
<5, (4, 8, 13)>
<13, (11, 5, 12)>
<12, (4, 11, 13)>
<14, (1, 8, 7)>
<10, (3, 13, 12)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [15].
