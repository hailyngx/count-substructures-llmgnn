Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 19) (14, 0) (14, 19) (17, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 12) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (3, 6) (3, 18) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 2) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 12) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 15) (7, 8) (7, 11) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 2) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 2) (1, 9) (1, 16) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 2) (18, 0) (18, 3) (18, 15) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 15) (2, 10) 

Response:
There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
