Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (0, 27) (0, 23) (0, 1) (27, 0) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 29) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 22) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 26) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 15) (6, 16) (9, 10) (9, 25) (9, 18) (22, 3) (23, 0) (23, 16) (23, 28) (23, 19) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 28) (21, 20) (21, 29) (28, 23) (28, 13) (28, 12) (28, 2) (15, 10) (15, 17) (15, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 1) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 2) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 20) (24, 8) (24, 5) (24, 29) (29, 11) (29, 21) (29, 24) (12, 8) (12, 28) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 14) (20, 21) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 5) (19, 4) (19, 23) (19, 2) (5, 15) (5, 24) (5, 12) (5, 20) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 12) (16, 6) (16, 23) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes directly. 

Let's go through the given edges and identify the 3-stars:

1. <1, (0, 4, 7)>
2. <2, (19, 26, 28)>
3. <3, (22, 25, 26)>
4. <5, (12, 20, 24)>
5. <6, (16, 19, 23)>
6. <8, (12, 13, 24)>
7. <9, (10, 17, 25)>
8. <11, (10, 21, 29)>
9. <14, (7, 12, 18)>
10. <15, (5, 10, 17)>
11. <18, (1, 9, 14)>
12. <28, (2, 13, 23)>
13. <29, (11, 21, 24)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
