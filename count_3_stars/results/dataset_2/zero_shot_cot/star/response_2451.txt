Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 13) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5, as it will be the center of the 3-stars:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 0, and 7.

Now, we will find the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 11, 7)>
<5, (9, 11, 0)>
<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<5, (11, 0, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
