Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes with exactly three neighbors, which represent the central nodes of 3-stars. Then, we will count the 3-stars with those central nodes. 

Based on the given information, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

- Node 1: (1, 6, 9), (1, 2, 8), (1, 2, 0), (1, 9, 0)
- Node 2: (2, 7, 5), (2, 5, 8), (2, 5, 0), (2, 7, 1), (2, 1, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 4, 8), (3, 0, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 9, 7), (4, 7, 2), (4, 3, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 6, 2), (5, 8, 2)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 9), (6, 9, 4), (6, 5, 2)
- Node 8: (8, 5, 2), (8, 3, 4), (8, 1, 2)
- Node 9: (9, 6, 4), (9, 4, 7), (9, 1, 0), (9, 3, 0)

Counting the total unique 3-stars gives us a total of [24] 3-stars. 

Therefore, the answer is [24]. 

List of unique 3-stars found: <1, (6, 9, 1)>, <2, (7, 5, 2)>, <2, (5, 8, 2)>, <3, (4, 8, 3)>, <3, (0, 9, 3)>, <4, (9, 7, 4)>, <4, (7, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 8, 4)>, <5, (6, 2, 5)>, <5, (8, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 9, 6)>, <6, (9, 4, 6)>, <6, (5, 2, 6)>, <8, (5, 2, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 8)>, <9, (6, 4, 9)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 0, 9)>, <9, (3, 0, 9)>.
