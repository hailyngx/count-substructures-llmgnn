Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 1, and 3: <5, (8, 1, 3)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 13: <9, (6, 8, 13)>
3. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 11: <6, (9, 2, 11)>
4. Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 12, and 13: <4, (7, 12, 13)>
5. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 11: <7, (9, 4, 11)>
6. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 10, and 3: <0, (14, 10, 3)>
7. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 6: <8, (5, 9, 6)>
8. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 14: <12, (9, 4, 14)>
9. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 11, and 13: <1, (5, 11, 13)>
10. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 8, and: <10, (0, 8, )>
11. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 7: <2, (6, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
