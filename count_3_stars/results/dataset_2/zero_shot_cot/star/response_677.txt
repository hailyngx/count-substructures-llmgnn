Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the graph can be found by counting how many nodes are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 2)>

Since we have found 5 unique 3-stars in the graph, the final answer in brackets is: [5].
