Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (5, 7) (5, 3) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in this network, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes:

1. Node 1: Connected to nodes 3, 11, 2.
2. Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 13, 9.
3. Node 3: Connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 12.
4. Node 4: Connected to nodes 7, 8, 14, 6.
5. Node 5: Connected to nodes 7, 3.
6. Node 6: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 9, 10, 11.
7. Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 12, 11, 5, 6.
8. Node 8: Connected to nodes 4, 1, 13, 14, 12.
9. Node 9: Connected to nodes 1, 6, 2, 11, 0.
10. Node 10: Connected to nodes 6, 11.
11. Node 11: Connected to nodes 7, 1, 6, 9, 10.
12. Node 12: Connected to nodes 7, 3, 8, 13.
13. Node 13: Connected to nodes 8, 12, 2, 0.
14. Node 14: Connected to nodes 4, 8, 0.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 14)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 12, 11)>
<8, (4, 1, 13)>
<9, (1, 6, 2)>
<10, (6, 11, 0)>
<11, (7, 1, 9)>
<12, (7, 3, 13)>
<13, (8, 12, 2)>
<14, (4, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given network is [12].
