Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 17) (16, 12) (16, 13) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 19) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 17) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 15) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 1) (15, 14) (15, 4) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 4) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 13) (4, 15) (4, 19) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 18) (13, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. Nodes connected to node 11: {8, 17, 18}
2. Nodes connected to node 16: {12, 13}
3. Nodes connected to node 5: {10, 0}
4. Nodes connected to node 9: {3, 1, 19} Not a 3-star because it has 3 leaves.
5. Nodes connected to node 6: {13} Not a 3-star because it has only 1 leaf.
6. Nodes connected to node 7: {12, 2, 1}
7. Nodes connected to node 0: {10, 3, 8}
8. Nodes connected to node 14: {18, 1, 15}
9. Nodes connected to node 2: {7, 12, 8, 19} Not a 3-star because it has 4 leaves.
10. Nodes connected to node 8: {11, 0, 2} Not a 3-star because it has more than 3 leaves.
11. Nodes connected to node 1: {9, 7, 14, 17} Not a 3-star because it has more than 3 leaves.
12. Nodes connected to node 17: {11, 12, 1} Not a 3-star because it has more than 3 leaves.
13. Nodes connected to node 15: {14, 4} Not a 3-star because it has only 2 leaves.
14. Nodes connected to node 18: {11, 14, 19, 10, 13} Not a 3-star because it has more than 3 leaves.
15. Nodes connected to node 19: {9, 2, 18, 4} Not a 3-star because it has 4 leaves.
16. Nodes connected to node 10: {5, 0, 18}
17. Nodes connected to node 3: {9, 0, 13}

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<11, (8, 17, 18)>
<16, (12, 13)>
<5, (10, 0)>
<10, (5, 0, 18)>
<3, (9, 0, 13)>

Therefore, there are [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
