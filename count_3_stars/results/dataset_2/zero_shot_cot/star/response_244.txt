Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. 

Let's start by looking at each node to see which ones form 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (4, 12, 3)>
- Node 1: <1, (7, 10, 14)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 11, 14)>
- Node 4: <4, (2, 5, 10)>
- Node 5: <5, (4, 8, 10)>
- Node 6: <6, (2, 8, 12)>
- Node 7: <7, (1, 2, 13)>
- Node 8: <8, (3, 5, 13)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 10, 11)>
- Node 10: <10, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 11: <11, (0, 3, 14)>
- Node 12: <12, (0, 6, 14)>
- Node 13: <13, (7, 8, 3)>
- Node 14: <14, (1, 3, 11)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars listed above, we find there are 15:

<0, (4, 12, 3)>
<1, (7, 10, 14)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 11, 14)>
<4, (2, 5, 10)>
<5, (4, 8, 10)>
<6, (2, 8, 12)>
<7, (1, 2, 13)>
<8, (3, 5, 13)>
<9, (2, 10, 11)>
<10, (1, 4, 8)>
<11, (0, 3, 14)>
<12, (0, 6, 14)>
<13, (7, 8, 3)>
<14, (1, 3, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
