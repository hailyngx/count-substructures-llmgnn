Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 23) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 25) (4, 26) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 9) (20, 11) (20, 29) (20, 12) (25, 4) (25, 15) (25, 21) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 14) (6, 22) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 24) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (21, 11) (21, 25) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 13) (28, 10) (22, 6) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 17) (26, 11) (26, 4) (26, 22) (26, 10) (17, 22) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 20) (29, 17) (29, 1) (13, 5) (13, 28) (19, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 27) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 26) (15, 7) (15, 25) (15, 0) (12, 20) (12, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 29) (1, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 18) (24, 2) (24, 27) (14, 6) (14, 3) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 23) (23, 16) (23, 18) (27, 9) (27, 24) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, let's find nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:

- Node 11 is connected to 4, 21, 20
- Node 4 is connected to 7, 19, 25
- Node 16 is connected to 7, 23, 11
- Node 7 is connected to 16, 4, 15
- Node 20 is connected to 11, 29, 12
- Node 25 is connected to 4, 15, 21
- Node 5 is connected to 13, 1, (No third node)
- Node 6 is connected to 14, 22, (No third node)
- Node 2 is connected to 8, 9, 24
- Node 8 is connected to 2, 9, 1
- Node 21 is connected to 11, 25, 28
- Node 28 is connected to 21, 13, 10
- Node 22 is connected to 6, 26, 10
- Node 26 is connected to 11, 4, 22
- Node 17 is connected to 22, 29, 18
- Node 29 is connected to 17, 20, 1
- Node 13 is connected to 5, 28, (No third node)
- Node 19 is connected to 4, (No second node)
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 14, (No third node)
- Node 9 is connected to 7, 2, 8, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed using the central node and its connected nodes:

- Node 11: <11, (4, 21, 20)>
- Node 4: <4, (7, 19, 25)>
- Node 16: <16, (7, 23, 11)>
- Node 7: <7, (16, 4, 15)>
- Node 20: <20, (11, 29, 12)>
- Node 25: <25, (4, 15, 21)>
- Node 9: <9, (7, 2, 8, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [6] 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
