Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph: 

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 3.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 8, and 7.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 7.
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 3.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- There are <6, (9, 7, 3)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, and <7, (6, 9, 3)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
