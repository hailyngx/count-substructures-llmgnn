Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 12) (8, 19) (8, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 13) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 6) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected nodes for each 3-star configuration.

Let's identify the 3-stars one by one:

1. Central node 11: (11, 16), (11, 14), (11, 0), (11, 5)
   <11, (16, 14, 0)>, <11, (16, 14, 5)>, <11, (16, 0, 5)>

2. Central node 16: (16, 11), (16, 17), (16, 1), (16, 14), (16, 15)
   <16, (11, 17, 1)>, <16, (11, 17, 14)>, <16, (11, 17, 15)>, <16, (11, 1, 14)>, <16, (11, 1, 15)>, <16, (11, 14, 15)>

3. Central node 3: (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 5), (3, 12)
   <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 12)>, <3, (6, 5, 12)>

4. Central node 15: (15, 16), (15, 12)
   <15, (16, 12, 3)>

5. Central node 8: (8, 19), (8, 7)
   <8, (19, 7, 6)>

6. Central node 4: (4, 18), (4, 9), (4, 10), (4, 6)
   <4, (18, 9, 10)>, <4, (18, 9, 6)>, <4, (18, 10, 6)>

7. Central node 18: (18, 4), (18, 19), (18, 9)
   <18, (4, 19, 9)>

8. Central node 0: (0, 11), (0, 10), (0, 17)
   <0, (11, 10, 17)>

9. Central node 1: (1, 16), (1, 5)
   <1, (16, 5, 3)>

10. Central node 13: (13, 17), (13, 12), (13, 19)
   <13, (17, 12, 19)>

11. Central node 17: (17, 16), (17, 0), (17, 13)
   <17, (16, 0, 13)>

12. Central node 19: (19, 8), (19, 18), (19, 13), (19, 14)
   <19, (8, 18, 13)>, <19, (8, 18, 14)>, <19, (8, 13, 14)>

13. Central node 10: (10, 4), (10, 0)
   <10, (4, 0, 11)>

14. Central node 14: (14, 11), (14, 16), (14, 19), (14, 6)
   <14, (11, 16, 19)>, <14, (11, 16, 6)>, <14, (11, 19, 6)>

15. Central node 5: (5, 11), (5, 3), (5, 1)
   <5, (11, 3, 1)>

16. Central node 6: (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 14), (6, 7)
   <6, (3, 4, 14)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 14, 7)>

17. Central node 7: (7, 8), (7, 6)
   <7, (8, 6, 14)>

18. Central node 12: (12, 3), (12, 15), (12, 13)
   <12, (3, 15, 13)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
