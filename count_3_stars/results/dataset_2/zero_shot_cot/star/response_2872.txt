Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 17) (0, 11) (0, 1) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 28) (3, 25) (3, 10) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 6) (25, 12) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 8) (12, 23) (2, 8) (2, 17) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 29) (8, 22) (14, 28) (14, 29) (11, 0) (28, 27) (28, 14) (28, 13) (28, 15) (13, 28) (13, 17) (26, 18) (26, 17) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 20) (1, 0) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 16) (15, 4) (15, 28) (15, 1) (15, 22) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 26) (17, 9) (6, 25) (6, 24) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 5) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 15) (22, 10) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 24) (9, 10) (29, 8) (29, 14) (29, 1) (16, 1) (16, 21) (21, 27) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 5) (5, 24) (5, 21) (23, 4) (23, 3) (23, 12) (23, 18) (23, 10) (20, 18) (20, 21) (10, 3) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 23) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to find all the 3-stars and then count them.

1. Start by identifying nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 4 has edges connecting to nodes 22, 23, and 15.
- Node 7 has edges connecting to nodes 12 and 17.
- Node 27 has edges connecting to nodes 21, 24, and 28.
- Node 3 has edges connecting to nodes 25, 10, and 23.
- Node 25 has edges connecting to nodes 3, 6, and 12.
- Node 12 has edges connecting to nodes 7, 25, and 23.
- Node 28 has edges connecting to nodes 27, 14, and 15.
- Node 8 has edges connecting to nodes 12, 2, and 29.
- Node 1 has edges connecting to nodes 0, 15, and 29.
- Node 18 has edges connecting to nodes 26, 23, and 20.
- Node 13 has edges connecting to nodes 28 and 17.
- Node 24 has edges connecting to nodes 27, 6, and 5.
- Node 22 has edges connecting to nodes 4, 8, and 15.
- Node 9 has edges connecting to nodes 18, 17, and 24.
- Node 29 has edges connecting to nodes 8, 14, and 1.
- Node 21 has edges connecting to nodes 27, 16, and 20.
- Node 5 has edges connecting to nodes 24 and 21.
- Node 20 has edges connecting to nodes 18, 21, and 5.
- Node 10 has edges connecting to nodes 3, 22, and 23.

2. From the above analysis, the identified 3-stars are:
<4, (22, 23, 15)>
<12, (7, 25, 23)>
<28, (27, 14, 15)>
<8, (12, 2, 29)>
<1, (0, 15, 29)>
<18, (26, 23, 20)>
<24, (27, 6, 5)>
<22, (4, 8, 15)>
<9, (18, 17, 24)>
<21, (27, 16, 20)>
<20, (18, 21, 5)>
<10, (3, 22, 23)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [11] 
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
