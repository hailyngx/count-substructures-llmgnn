Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 0), (5, 3) -> <5, (9, 0, 3)>
2. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8), (9, 1), (9, 0) -> <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 1, 0)>
3. Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 2) -> <6, (9, 1, 3)>
4. Node 4: (4, 8), (4, 1), (4, 2) -> <4, (8, 1, 2)>
5. Node 7: (7, 3), (7, 8) -> <7, (3, 8)>
6. Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 0), (1, 8) -> <1, (9, 6, 4)>, <1, (9, 3, 0)>, <1, (9, 8, 6)>, <1, (9, 4, 3)>, <1, (6, 4, 3)>, <1, (6, 3, 0)>, <1, (4, 3, 0)>
7. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 1) -> <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 1)>, <3, (6, 7, 1)>
8. Node 8: (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 1), (8, 2) -> <8, (9, 4, 7)>, <8, (9, 4, 1)>, <8, (9, 7, 2)>, <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (4, 1, 2)>
9. Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 0) -> <2, (6, 4, 8)>
10. Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 1), (0, 2) -> <0, (5, 9, 1)>, <0, (5, 9, 2)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
