Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
<1, (9, 3, 12)>
<3, (1, 13, 12)>
<8, (13, 5, 14)>
<13, (8, 11, 3)>
<10, (9, 5, 14)>
<11, (1, 13, 4)>
<5, (3, 8, 10)>
<0, (8, 7, 5)>
<7, (10, 0, 2)>
<4, (6, 11, 14)>
<12, (9, 1, 4)>
<2, (1, 7, 4)>
<6, (4, 14, 0)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [13]
