Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 26) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 11) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 19) (9, 8) (9, 22) (22, 1) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 21) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 16) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 5) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 12) (20, 10) (4, 27) (4, 10) (11, 8) (11, 0) (28, 24) (28, 18) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 6) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 21) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 2) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 12) (12, 20) (12, 2) (12, 5) (6, 1) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 0) (10, 20) (10, 4) (10, 0) (7, 22) (13, 23) (13, 25) (13, 18) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 19) (5, 24) (5, 17) (5, 12) (14, 27) (14, 1) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 13) (18, 29) (19, 23) (19, 25) (29, 22) (29, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

Node 1: {3, 6, 14, 22}
Node 2: {15, 21, 26, 12}
Node 3: {1, 26}
Node 4: {27, 10}
Node 5: {24, 17, 12}
Node 6: {1, 22, 17, 0}
Node 7: {22}
Node 8: {23, 9, 25, 11}
Node 9: {8, 22}
Node 10: {20, 4, 0}
Node 11: {8, 0}
Node 12: {20, 5, 2}
Node 13: {23, 25, 18}
Node 14: {27, 1}
Node 15: {2, 27}
Node 16: {26, 0, 21}
Node 17: {20, 6, 5}
Node 18: {27, 28, 13, 29}
Node 19: {23, 25}
Node 20: {26, 17, 12, 10}
Node 21: {24, 16, 2}
Node 22: {1, 9, 6, 29, 7}
Node 23: {8, 13, 19}
Node 24: {28, 5, 21}
Node 25: {8, 13, 19}
Node 26: {3, 2, 20, 16}
Node 27: {15, 4, 18, 14}
Node 28: {24, 18}
Node 29: {22, 18}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes: {6, 14, 22} <1, (6, 14, 22)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes: {21, 26, 12} <2, (21, 26, 12)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes: {26} <3, (26)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes: {10} <4, (10)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes: {24, 17, 12} <5, (24, 17, 12)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes: {22, 17, 0} <6, (22, 17, 0)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes: {9, 25, 11} <8, (9, 25, 11)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes: {22} <9, (22)>
- Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes: {20, 4, 0} <10, (20, 4, 0)>
- Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes: {20, 5, 2} <12, (20, 5, 2)>
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes: {23, 25, 18} <13, (23, 25, 18)>
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes: {27} <14, (27)>
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes: {2, 27} <15, (2, 27)>
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes: {26} <16, (26)>
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes: {20, 6, 5} <17, (20, 6, 5)>
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes: {28, 13, 29} <18, (28, 13, 29)>
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes: {23, 25} <19, (23, 25)>
- Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes: {26, 17, 12} <20, (26, 17, 12)>
- Node 21 forms a 3-star with nodes: {24, 16, 2} <21, (24, 16, 2)>
- Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes: {9, 6, 29} <22, (9, 6, 29)>
- Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes: {25, 19} <23, (25, 19)>
- Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes: {5, 21} <24, (5, 21)>
- Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes: {19} <25, (19)>
- Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes: {16, 2} <26, (16, 2)>
- Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes: {15, 14} <27, (15, 14)>
- Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes: {18} <28, (18)>
- Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes: {22, 18} <29, (22, 18)>

Therefore, there are 22 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].
