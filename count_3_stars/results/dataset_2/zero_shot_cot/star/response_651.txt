Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 12) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (7, 8, 14)>
<1, (4, 6, 13)>
<2, (4, 10, -)>
<3, (8, 9, 14)>
<4, (1, 2, 12)>
<5, (7, 11, 13)>
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, -)>
<10, (2, 3, 14)>
<11, (5, 7, 13)>
<12, (1, 4, 11)>
<13, (1, 5, 11)>
<14, (0, 10, 3)>

Total number of 3-stars: [14]
