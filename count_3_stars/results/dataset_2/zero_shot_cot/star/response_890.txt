Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's first list out all the 3-stars:

<4, (7, 2, 9)>
<6, (5, 1, 3)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>
<8, (9, 0, 1)>
<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<0, (8, 4, 5)>
<1, (6, 9, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 5)>
<3, (6, 5, 2)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
[9]
