Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 16) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 15) (14, 6) (17, 9) (17, 18) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 24) (25, 3) (25, 23) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 29) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 0) (27, 12) (27, 23) (26, 1) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 6) (4, 23) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 17) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 24) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (9, 21) (9, 17) (9, 22) (9, 28) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 5) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 15) (5, 18) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 28) (10, 21) (10, 26) (10, 7) (10, 29) (2, 4) (2, 22) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 0) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 24) (15, 21) (15, 26) (15, 11) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 0) (20, 1) (6, 14) (6, 26) (6, 4) (0, 12) (0, 28) (0, 24) (23, 25) (23, 27) (23, 4) (29, 13) (29, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars first:
<1, (16, 20, 26)>
<2, (4, 22, 28)>
<3, (11, 24, 25)>
<4, (2, 6, 23)>
<5, (16, 18, 19)>
<6, (4, 6, 26)>
<7, (10, 12, 29)>
<8, (13, 18, 19)>
<9, (19, 21, 28)>
<10, (7, 10, 26)>
<11, (3, 15, 21)>
<12, (0, 27, 28)>
<13, (8, 13, 29)>
<14, (6, 14, 26)>
<15, (11, 15, 26)>
<16, (1, 16, 24)>
<17, (9, 17, 21)>
<18, (5, 8, 24)>
<19, (5, 9, 19)>
<20, (1, 20, 30)>
<21, (9, 15, 21)>
<22, (2, 5, 22)>
<23, (4, 23, 27)>
<24, (0, 3, 24)>
<25, (3, 25, 27)>
<26, (1, 6, 10)>
<27, (12, 23, 25)>
<28, (0, 19, 28)>
<29, (7, 10, 13)>

There are 28 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [28].
