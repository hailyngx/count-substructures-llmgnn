Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<5, (9, 0, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<3, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (9, 6, 1)>
