Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 11) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 14) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[4]

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (6, 2, 7)>
<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<7, (0, 10, 13)>
<4, (12, 0, 11)>
