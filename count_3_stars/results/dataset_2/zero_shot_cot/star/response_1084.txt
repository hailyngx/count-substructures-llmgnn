Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 5) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 10) (17, 3) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 18) (2, 11) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 12) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 7) (5, 16) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 15) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 13) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 13) (3, 17) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 0, 6, 12, 2
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 15, 5
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 19, 5
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 3
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 12, 18
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 11, 7
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 10, 12
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 12, 19
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 11, 10, 18, 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 16, 14, 19, 1, 15
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 14, 7, 5, 15
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 5, 19
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 11, 1, 13
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 13
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 17, 9, 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 0
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 4, 13
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 0

Now, let's list down the 3-stars:
<11, (16, 6, 12)>
<16, (11, 15, 5)>
<14, (19, 5, NA)>
<17, (10, 3, NA)>
<10, (17, 12, 18)>
<2, (11, 7, NA)>
<18, (10, 12, NA)>
<7, (2, 12, 19)>
<12, (11, 10, 18)>
<5, (16, 14, 19)>
<19, (14, 7, 15)>
<15, (16, 5, 19)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<6, (11, 1, 13)>
<9, (1, 3, 13)>
<3, (17, 9, 4)>
<4, (1, 3, 0)>
<0, (11, 4, 13)>
<13, (6, 9, 0)>

There are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
