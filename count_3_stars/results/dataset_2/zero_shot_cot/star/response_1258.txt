Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 0)>
<1, (6, 3, 4)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<2, (3, 0, 4)>
<8, (9, 1, 7)>
<0, (9, 6, 2)>
<7, (5, 3, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [10] 3-stars.
