Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 2) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 24) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 18) (17, 13) (17, 18) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 11) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 28) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 29) (12, 3) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 15) (14, 0) (14, 29) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 20) (28, 23) (26, 1) (26, 2) (26, 20) (9, 21) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 27) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 2) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 3) (22, 16) (22, 19) (22, 3) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 19) (15, 25) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 22) (29, 7) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 5) (29, 11) (5, 23) (5, 29) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 16) (20, 6) (20, 26) (20, 27) (25, 15) (24, 21) (24, 13) (11, 8) (11, 29) (27, 9) (27, 13) (27, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (degree 3) and form a 3-star. 

From the given edges, the potential center nodes are: 1, 4, 7, 13, 17, 21, 23, 26.

Let's go through each potential center node and list the connected nodes.

For node 1:
- Connected to: 21, 2, 8
<1, (21, 2, 8)>

For node 4:
- Connected to: 19, 23, 16
<4, (19, 23, 16)>

For node 7:
- Connected to: 12, 29, 18
<7, (12, 29, 18)>

For node 13:
- Connected to: 17, 24, 27
<13, (17, 24, 27)>

For node 17:
- Connected to: 13, 18, 24
<17, (13, 18, 24)>

For node 21:
- Connected to: 1, 9, 24
<21, (1, 9, 24)>

For node 23:
- Connected to: 4, 5, 28
<23, (4, 5, 28)>

For node 26:
- Connected to: 1, 2, 20
<26, (1, 2, 20)>

Count of 3-stars: [8]
