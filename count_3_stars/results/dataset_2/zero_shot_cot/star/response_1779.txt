Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 3) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 8) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <5, (8, 1, 4)>
2. <5, (4, 1, 11)>
3. <5, (4, 7, 10)>
4. <5, (1, 9, 10)>
5. <4, (7, 14, 1)>
6. <7, (0, 11, 6)>
7. <10, (9, 11, 0)>
8. <11, (7, 10, 1)>
9. <0, (7, 12, 8)>
10. <14, (3, 13, 4)>
11. <2, (12, 3, 4)>
12. <12, (0, 13, 6)>
13. <1, (9, 4, 5)>
14. <8, (0, 1, 5)>
15. <3, (13, 12, 14)>
16. <6, (12, 7, 8)>

Now, by counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we can see that there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
