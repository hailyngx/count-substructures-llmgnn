Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 29) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 23) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (18, 5) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 20) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 16) (22, 21) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 24) (0, 15) (0, 27) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 17) (20, 18) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 14) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 20) (13, 17) (26, 18) (21, 22) (11, 22) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 17) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 29) (17, 27) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 11) (14, 20) (14, 28) (28, 3) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 24) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 16) (19, 12) (19, 11) (19, 28) (19, 29) (29, 5) (29, 23) (29, 19) (24, 3) (24, 15) (24, 28) (16, 22) (16, 1) (10, 27) (25, 8) (25, 4) (4, 25) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given edges to identify the 3-star structures. We are looking for a central node (the center) connected to exactly three other nodes (the leaves). 

1. Starting from node 5: (5, 9), (5, 18), (5, 1), and (5, 29) form a 3-star with node 5 as the center.
2. Moving to node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), and (9, 2) form a 3-star with node 9 as the center.
3. Exploring the remaining nodes systematically:
   - Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 1), and (6, 7)
   - Node 18: (18, 5), (18, 22), and (18, 26)
   - Node 22: (22, 18), (22, 11), and (22, 16)
   - Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 28), and (3, 24)
   - Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 20), and (15, 0)
   - Node 0: (0, 15), (0, 27), and (0, 28)
   - Node 27: (27, 0), (27, 10), and (27, 17)
   - Node 20: (20, 18), (20, 15), and (20, 13)
   - Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 12), and (7, 17)
   - Node 12: (12, 7), (12, 2), and (12, 19)
   - Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 12), and (2, 8)
   - Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 25), and (8, 11)
   - Node 13: (13, 20), (13, 17), and (13, 14)
   - Node 26: (26, 18)
   - Node 21: (21, 22)
   - Node 11: (11, 22), (11, 8), and (11, 23)
   - Node 23: (23, 9), (23, 11), and (23, 29)
   - Node 17: (17, 27), (17, 7), and (17, 13)
   - Node 14: (14, 20), and (14, 28)
   - Node 28: (28, 3), (28, 14), and (28, 19)
   - Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 6), and (1, 8)
   - Node 19: (19, 12), (19, 11), and (19, 28)
   - Node 29: (29, 5) and (29, 23)
   - Node 24: (24, 3), (24, 15), and (24, 28)
   - Node 16: (16, 22)
   - Node 10: (10, 27)
   - Node 25: (25, 8)
   - Node 4: (4, 25)

There are <5, (9, 18, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 2)>, and <0, (15, 27, 28)> as 3-stars. 

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
