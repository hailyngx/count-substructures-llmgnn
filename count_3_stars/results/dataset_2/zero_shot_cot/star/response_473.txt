Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 26) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 2) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (0, 7) (0, 21) (0, 19) (0, 9) (7, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 4) (20, 29) (20, 8) (20, 2) (20, 10) (29, 20) (29, 22) (29, 14) (13, 17) (13, 25) (13, 23) (11, 25) (23, 13) (23, 26) (23, 2) (23, 10) (6, 26) (6, 8) (16, 18) (16, 19) (26, 15) (26, 23) (26, 6) (14, 29) (14, 22) (14, 24) (22, 29) (22, 14) (22, 5) (2, 27) (2, 17) (2, 20) (2, 23) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 28) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 12) (9, 4) (25, 13) (25, 11) (25, 8) (25, 24) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 24) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 5) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 20) (8, 6) (8, 25) (10, 20) (10, 23) (10, 18) (5, 22) (5, 28) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 28) (19, 24) (24, 14) (24, 25) (24, 18) (24, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes serve as the center of a 3-star. 

Let's list all the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (17, 2, 27)>
<2, (17, 20, 23)>
<4, (9, 21, 28)>
<5, (22, 28, 29)>
<6, (8, 23, 26)>
<8, (3, 17, 20)>
<9, (0, 4, 12)>
<10, (18, 20, 23)>
<11, (25, 23, 27)>
<13, (17, 25, 27)>
<14, (22, 24, 29)>
<15, (26, 27, 15)>
<16, (18, 19, 24)>
<17, (1, 2, 27)>
<18, (10, 16, 24)>
<19, (0, 16, 28)>
<20, (2, 17, 23)>
<21, (0, 4, 27)>
<22, (5, 14, 29)>
<23, (10, 13, 25)>
<24, (14, 18, 19)>
<25, (11, 13, 27)>
<26, (6, 15, 23)>
<27, (1, 13, 15)>
<28, (4, 5, 19)>
<29, (14, 22, 20)>

Now, as we have listed all the unique 3-stars, let's count how many there are. 

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
