Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 18) (9, 17) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 15) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 11) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 23) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 29) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 20) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 4) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 25) (2, 26) (2, 22) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 1) (18, 9) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 20) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 25) (27, 16) (12, 18) (12, 17) (12, 28) (1, 22) (1, 29) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 1) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 20) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 13) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 28) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 28) (16, 27) (17, 9) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 12) (28, 12) (28, 4) (28, 13) (20, 10) (20, 19) (20, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<2, (26, 22, 1)>
<4, (15, 3, 13)>
<5, (7, 6, 23)>
<6, (5, 25, 27)>
<7, (21, 11, 5)>
<8, (10, 14, 0)>
<11, (7, 5, 29)>
<12, (18, 17, 28)>
<15, (21, 5, 4)>
<18, (9, 19, 0)>
<19, (18, 17, 20)>
<20, (10, 19, 14)>
<21, (7, 15, 1)>
<22, (26, 2, 14)>
<25, (6, 23, 27)>
<26, (26, 10, 17)>
<27, (25, 16, 29)>
<28, (12, 4, 13)>
<29, (11, 25, 1)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [20].
