Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Next, let's find the degrees of each node:
Degree of node 0: 4
Degree of node 1: 3
Degree of node 2: 4
Degree of node 3: 3
Degree of node 4: 5
Degree of node 5: 4
Degree of node 6: 4
Degree of node 7: 4
Degree of node 8: 3
Degree of node 9: 4

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
In a 3-star, the center node must have degree 3 and the leaves must have degree 1 (since they are only connected to the center).

From the degrees of each node, we see that nodes 1, 3, and 8 have degree 3, which means they can act as center nodes for 3-stars. Now, we need to find their corresponding leaves.

For node 1:
Possible 3-star: <1, (0, 2, 9)>
For node 3:
Possible 3-star: <3, (7, 8, 0)>
For node 8:
Possible 3-star: <8, (4, 5, 9)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.
Therefore, the answer is [3].
