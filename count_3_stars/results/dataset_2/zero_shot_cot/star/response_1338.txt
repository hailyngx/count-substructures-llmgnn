Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 1) (15, 26) (15, 9) (27, 12) (2, 29) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 26) (29, 14) (6, 28) (6, 25) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 13) (14, 29) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 23) (12, 27) (12, 3) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 25) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 1) (26, 4) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 0) (28, 18) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 22) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 14) (20, 5) (20, 10) (13, 9) (13, 16) (10, 20) (10, 7) (21, 16) (16, 13) (16, 21) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 23) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 16) (7, 8) (0, 28) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 19) (24, 3) (24, 22) (5, 20) (5, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 5) (18, 28) (18, 23) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 18) (22, 14) (22, 3) (22, 16) (22, 24) (25, 6) (25, 1) (4, 26) (4, 0) (4, 19) (19, 0) (19, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's go step by step:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 29, 17, and 28.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 2, 29, and 5.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 13, 21, and 23.

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
<14, (29, 17, 28)>
<20, (2, 29, 5)>
<16, (13, 21, 23)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars:
