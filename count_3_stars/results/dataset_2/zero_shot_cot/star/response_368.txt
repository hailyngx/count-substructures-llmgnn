Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (7, 21) (7, 26) (7, 13) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 29) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 23) (11, 28) (11, 22) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 23) (1, 22) (3, 9) (3, 1) (22, 11) (22, 1) (22, 23) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 22) (23, 24) (5, 14) (5, 20) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 29) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 8) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 20) (18, 13) (19, 4) (19, 15) (26, 7) (26, 16) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 12) (20, 5) (20, 18) (29, 21) (29, 0) (24, 6) (24, 23) (24, 8) (24, 27) (12, 28) (12, 25) (12, 8) (16, 26) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 4) (15, 19) (17, 6) (17, 27) (25, 12) (25, 8) (8, 21) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 12) (8, 25) (2, 4) (2, 27) (27, 24) (27, 17) (27, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 21), (6, 24)
- Node 9: (9, 6), (9, 15), (9, 3)
- Node 7: (7, 21), (7, 26), (7, 13)
- Node 21: (21, 6), (21, 7), (21, 8)

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <6, (9, 21, 24)>
- <9, (6, 15, 3)>
- <7, (21, 26, 13)>
- <21, (6, 7, 8)>

Since each unique 3-star pattern was listed once, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
