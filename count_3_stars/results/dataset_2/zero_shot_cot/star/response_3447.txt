Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the 3-stars. For a 3-star, the center node must have degree 3.

The nodes with degree 3 are: 7, 12, 0, 1, 6, 2, 10, 11, and 14.

Possible 3-stars with center node 7:
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 14)>

Possible 3-stars with center node 12:
<12, (13, 3, 8)>

Possible 3-stars with center node 0:
<0, (7, 5, 1)>

Possible 3-stars with center node 1:
<1, (7, 6, 5)>
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>

Possible 3-stars with center node 6:
<6, (7, 1, 10)>
<6, (2, 11, 10)>

Possible 3-stars with center node 2:
<2, (6, 13, 14)>

Possible 3-stars with center node 10:
<10, (6, 8, 13)>

Possible 3-stars with center node 11:
<11, (6, 14, 8)>
<11, (4, 14, 6)>

Possible 3-stars with center node 14:
<14, (7, 11, 2)>
<14, (13, 4, 6)>

There are a total of 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
