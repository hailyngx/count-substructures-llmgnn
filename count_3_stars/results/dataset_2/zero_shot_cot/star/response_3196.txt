Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 17) (23, 17) (23, 7) (23, 12) (28, 29) (28, 3) (28, 24) (28, 25) (28, 2) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 24) (9, 22) (9, 14) (8, 25) (8, 3) (25, 28) (25, 8) (25, 27) (25, 17) (27, 25) (27, 17) (5, 26) (5, 11) (26, 5) (26, 2) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 25) (17, 27) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 16) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 20) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 2) (11, 22) (11, 5) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (24, 28) (24, 29) (24, 11) (3, 28) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 23) (7, 3) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 10) (13, 21) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 14) (2, 15) (20, 16) (20, 4) (12, 23) (12, 15) (15, 2) (15, 12) (15, 0) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 15) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 20) (4, 14) (10, 19) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 4) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star can only have degree 3. Let's identify the central nodes based on this restriction.

Central nodes: 22, 28, 17, 1, 6, 16, 21, 26, 0

Let's find the leaves connected to each central node to form 3-stars:

1. Central node 22: (22, 9, 14) <22, (9, 11, 14)>
2. Central node 28: (28, 24, 29) <28, (24, 29, 3)>
3. Central node 17: (17, 25, 27) <17, (25, 27, 22)>
4. Central node 1: (1, 6, 19) <1, (6, 19, 11)>
5. Central node 6: (6, 1, 4) <6, (1, 4, 16)>
6. Central node 16: (16, 6, 21) <16, (6, 21, 20)>
7. Central node 26: (26, 5, 2) <26, (5, 2, 14)>
8. Central node 0: (0, 18, 15) <0, (18, 15, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
