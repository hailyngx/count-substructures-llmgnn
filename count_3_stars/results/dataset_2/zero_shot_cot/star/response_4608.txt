Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 10) (4, 10) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

First, let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<2, (9, 11, 12)>
<4, (8, 10, 14)>
<5, (0, 12, 14)>
<6, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 14)>
<9, (2, 6, 14)>
<10, (4, 8, 14)>
<11, (2, 3, 12)>
<12, (2, 5, 11)>
<14, (0, 5, 8)>

Now, counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us [11].
