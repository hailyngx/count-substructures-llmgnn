Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's list out the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 7, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 8, 5, 7, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 7, and 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 0, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 2, 1, 7, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, 0, and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 0, 3, 2, and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 1.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (6, 8, 7)>
<1, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (9, 5, 7)>
<3, (5, 0, 7)>
<4, (5, 1, 7)>
<5, (6, 4, 2)>
<6, (9, 5, 0)>
<7, (8, 5, 3)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
