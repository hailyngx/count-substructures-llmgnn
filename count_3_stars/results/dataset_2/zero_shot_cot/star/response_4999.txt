Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step-by-step: 

1. Each 3-star requires a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. We will check each node in the graph to see if it forms a 3-star with its adjacent nodes.
3. We will list the unique 3-stars found.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 2)>
<7, (1, 3, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 5)>
<9, (8, 3, 2)>
<0, (7, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
