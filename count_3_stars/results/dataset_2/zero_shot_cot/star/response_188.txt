Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (16, 1) (16, 18) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 17) (4, 0) (4, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 10) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 2) (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 9) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10) (9, 19) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's list all the nodes that are endpoints of edges, considering the list of edges provided:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 1: (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 0)
- Node 2: (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 17)
- Node 3: (3, 15)
- Node 4: (4, 0) (4, 17)
- Node 5: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 18) (6, 0)
- Node 7: (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 0)
- Node 8: (8, 2) (8, 17)
- Node 9: (19, 9)
- Node 10: (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13)
- Node 11: (11, 13)
- Node 12: (12, 5) (12, 2)
- Node 13: (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10)
- Node 14: (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 10)
- Node 15: (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 7)
- Node 16: (16, 1) (16, 18)
- Node 17: (17, 2) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1)
- Node 18: (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 10)
- Node 19: (19, 15) (19, 2) (19, 14)

Now, counting the total number of unique 3-stars: [(1, (16, 18, 13)), (2, (8, 12, 19)), (3, (15)), (4, (0, 17)), (5, (6, 12, 18)), (7, (15, 5)), (8, (2, 17)), (9, (19)), (10, (18, 1, 14)), (11, (13)), (14, (6, 19, 10)), (16, (1, 18)), (17, (2, 8, 4, 1)), (19, (15, 2, 14))] = [14].
