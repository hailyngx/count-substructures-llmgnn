Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (10, 9) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 13) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<0, (7, 9, 12)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (5, 9, 13)>
