Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first find all the nodes that act as central nodes of a 3-star. Then, we identify the leaves connected to each central node to form unique 3-stars. 

Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the graph:

1. Node 5 has 5 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
2. Node 9 has 4 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
3. Node 6 has 5 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
4. Node 10 has 4 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
5. Node 11 has 5 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
6. Node 4 has 4 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
7. Node 8 has 4 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
8. Node 3 has 4 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
9. Node 13 has 4 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
10. Node 12 has 3 edges, not forming a 3-star.
11. Node 2 has 3 edges, not forming a 3-star.
12. Node 14 has 4 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
13. Node 7 has 5 edges, making it a central node in a 3-star.
14. Node 1 has 3 edges, not forming a 3-star.
15. Node 0 has 2 edges, not forming a 3-star.

Next, we list the unique 3-stars as follows:
<5, (9, 6, 13)>
<9, (6, 2, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 7)>
<10, (5, 11, 13)>
<11, (10, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 11, 14)>
<3, (8, 7, 14)>
<13, (5, 6, 10)>
<7, (9, 6, 11)>
<14, (11, 8, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars found, we get [11].
