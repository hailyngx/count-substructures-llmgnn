Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them, forming a 3-star pattern. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 9, and 0: <1, (4, 9, 0)>
2. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 5: <2, (4, 6, 5)>
3. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 6, and 9: <3, (7, 6, 9)>
4. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 2, and 1: <5, (7, 2, 1)>
5. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 9, and 1: <8, (6, 9, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
