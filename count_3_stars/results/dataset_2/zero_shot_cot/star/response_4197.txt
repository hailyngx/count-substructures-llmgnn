Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all possible 3-stars. 

1. Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: Nodes 5 and 8.
2. Identify 3-stars using Nodes 5 and 8:

<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<8, (5, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 7, 1)> 

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [3].
