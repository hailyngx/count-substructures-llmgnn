Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 18) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (19, 1) (19, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 15) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (2, 11) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 4) (4, 16) (4, 15) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 19) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, let's look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

From the given edges, we have the following 3-stars:
<0, (16, 17, 15)>
<1, (5, 19, 12)>
<3, (11, 17, 14)>
<5, (1, 8, 18)>
<6, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 18, 13)>
<8, (6, 9, 5)>
<9, (6, 8, 14)>
<12, (1, 0, 19)>
<13, (9, 0, 14)>
<14, (9, 3, 15)>
<15, (0, 14, 5)>
<16, (0, 4, 17)>
<17, (3, 18, 0)>
<18, (17, 5, 7)>
<19, (1, 12, 0)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars: [16].
