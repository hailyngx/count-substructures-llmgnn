Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 14) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 18) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (18, 17) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 10) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

The central node of a 3-star will have degree 3 and the other nodes connected to it will have degree 1.

Let's find all the 3-stars:
- Central node 11: (9, 14, 16)
- Central node 15: (3, 5, 9)
- Central node 10: (4, 7, 16)
- Central node 5: (0, 7, 15)
- Central node 4: (0, 10, 18)
- Central node 0: (2, 4, 6)
- Central node 7: (1, 5, 10)
- Central node 16: (10, 11, 14)
- Central node 9: (11, 13, 15)
- Central node 14: (1, 11, 13)
- Central node 1: (3, 7, 14)
- Central node 18: (4, 17, 10)
- Central node 6: (0, 19, 2)
- Central node 2: (0, 6, 14)
- Central node 19: (4, 9, 17)

Now, we count and list the unique 3-stars:
<11, (9, 14, 16)>
<15, (3, 5, 9)>
<10, (4, 7, 16)>
<5, (0, 7, 15)>
<4, (0, 10, 18)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<7, (1, 5, 10)>
<16, (10, 11, 14)>
<9, (11, 13, 15)>
<14, (1, 11, 13)>
<1, (3, 7, 14)>
<18, (4, 17, 10)>
<6, (0, 19, 2)>
<2, (0, 6, 14)>
<19, (4, 9, 17)>

There are [15] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
