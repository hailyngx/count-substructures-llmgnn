Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 8) (17, 2) (0, 14) (0, 12) (3, 16) (3, 12) (11, 19) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 4) (13, 1) (13, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 10) (15, 14) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 17) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 7) (18, 19) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 4) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 16) (7, 9) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 4) (6, 17) (6, 11) (6, 2) (2, 14) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 16) (9, 7) (9, 12) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars below and count them:

<0, (12, 14, 15)>
<1, (2, 10, 13)>
<2, (1, 6, 17)>
<3, (12, 16, 0)>
<4, (5, 10, 16)>
<5, (4, 11, 19)>
<6, (2, 11, 17)>
<7, (8, 10, 13)>
<8, (7, 10, 17)>
<9, (7, 12, 16)>
<11, (5, 6, 19)>
<12, (0, 14, 3)>
<13, (1, 7, 12)>
<14, (0, 12, 15)>
<15, (14, 2, 17)>
<16, (3, 4, 7)>
<17, (6, 8, 15)>
<18, (19, 18, 19)>
<19, (11, 18, 5)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
