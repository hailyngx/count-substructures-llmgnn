Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- (5, 9, 1, 3) is a 3-star.
- (5, 9, 7, 1) is a 3-star.
- (5, 1, 3, 4) is a 3-star.
- (5, 3, 1, 8) is a 3-star.
- (5, 7, 9, 2) is a 3-star.
- (9, 1, 5, 3) is a 3-star.
- (9, 7, 5, 1) is a 3-star.
- (1, 5, 3, 4) is a 3-star.
- (3, 5, 1, 8) is a 3-star.
- (7, 5, 9, 2) is a 3-star.

[The total number of 3-stars is <5, (9, 1, 3)>, <5, (9, 7, 1)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 1, 8)>, <5, (7, 9, 2)>, <9, (1, 5, 3)>, <9, (7, 5, 1)>, <1, (5, 3, 4)>, <3, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (5, 9, 2)> = 10]
