Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to find all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

By counting the degree of each node in the graph, we can identify the 3-star graphs. 

Here are the nodes with degree 3:
- Node 10: (10, 11), (10, 9), (10, 5), (10, 14)
- Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 6), (2, 14)

Considering these nodes, we can construct the 3-stars:

<10, (11, 9, 5)>
<2, (9, 6, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
