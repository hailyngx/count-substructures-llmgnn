Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (6, 9, 1)>
2. <1, (3, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (9, 7, 8)>
4. <3, (1, 9, 7)>
5. <4, (1, 0, 5)>
6. <5, (6, 1, 3)>
7. <6, (0, 5, 9)>
8. <7, (3, 2, 8)>
9. <8, (9, 7, 2)>
10. <9, (8, 2, 3)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[10]
