Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 4 is connected to 0, 5, and 6.
   - Node 7 is connected to 1, 5, and 6.
   - Node 1 is connected to 2, 8, and 9.
   - Node 6 is connected to 2, 4, and 8.
   - Node 8 is connected to 0, 1, and 9.

2. Counting the number of 3-stars involving the identified nodes:
   - 3-star with central node 4: <4, (0, 5, 6)>
   - 3-star with central node 7: <7, (1, 5, 6)>
   - 3-star with central node 1: <1, (2, 8, 9)>
   - 3-star with central node 6: <6, (2, 4, 8)>
   - 3-star with central node 8: <8, (0, 1, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
