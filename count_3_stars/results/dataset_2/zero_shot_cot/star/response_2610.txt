Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
There are <5, (9, 10, 12)>, <9, (5, 11, 14)>, <1, (3, 2, 14)>, <3, (1, 0, 4)>, <10, (5, 11, 0)>, <11, (9, 10, 7)>, <0, (3, 10, 2)>, <2, (5, 1, 12)>, <7, (10, 11, 13)>, <8, (11, 0, 14)>, <6, (8, 14, 4)>, <12, (5, 3, 2)>, and <14, (5, 1, 8)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
