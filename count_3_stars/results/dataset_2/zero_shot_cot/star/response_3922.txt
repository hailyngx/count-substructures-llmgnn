Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (2, 3) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 0) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 13) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars:

<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (4, 12, 6)>
<1, (14, 5, 8)>
<3, (10, 9, 2)>
<8, (4, 1, 9)>
<12, (7, 10, 11)>
<2, (3, 5, 0)>
<5, (1, 8, 13)>
<13, (7, 1, 5)>
<9, (7, 3, 8)>
<11, (12, 5, 0)>
<14, (1, 6, 0)>
<6, (7, 14, 10)>
<10, (4, 3, 12)>
<0, (4, 8, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [15].
