The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 9) (21, 7) (21, 13) (21, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 17) (23, 27) (12, 10) (12, 11) (27, 23) (27, 20) (27, 26) (27, 16) (15, 20) (15, 14) (15, 24) (20, 7) (20, 27) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 28) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 22) (9, 18) (5, 24) (5, 14) (13, 21) (13, 1) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 25) (17, 11) (25, 17) (25, 26) (25, 14) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 25) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 3) (18, 9) (1, 13) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 16) (29, 1) (29, 0) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 1) (24, 15) (24, 5) (24, 0) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 25) (14, 19) (14, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (16, 4) (16, 27) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 10) (0, 29) (0, 24) (10, 22) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 16) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 16) (28, 20) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. 3-star with center node 4: (4, 7, 9), (4, 7, 16)
2. 3-star with center node 7: (7, 4, 9), (7, 4, 21), (7, 9, 22)
3. 3-star with center node 9: (9, 4, 7), (9, 7, 22), (9, 18, 22)
4. 3-star with center node 16: (16, 4, 7), (16, 27, 1), (16, 4, 8)
5. 3-star with center node 21: (21, 7, 4), (21, 13, 1), (21, 7, 20)
6. 3-star with center node 22: (22, 9, 7), (22, 9, 19), (22, 10, 17)
7. 3-star with center node 27: (27, 16, 4), (27, 20, 7), (27, 23, 26)
8. 3-star with center node 20: (20, 7, 27), (20, 15, 14), (20, 17, 25)
9. 3-star with center node 1: (1, 13, 21), (1, 11, 12), (1, 11, 16)
10. 3-star with center node 25: (25, 17, 14), (25, 26, 21), (25, 14, 3)
11. 3-star with center node 19: (19, 22, 11), (19, 14, 3), (19, 11, 1)
12. 3-star with center node 11: (11, 12, 10), (11, 17, 22), (11, 1, 13)
13. 3-star with center node 29: (29, 1, 0)
14. 3-star with center node 10: (10, 6, 8)
15. 3-star with center node 3: (3, 14, 19), (3, 8, 6)
16. 3-star with center node 14: (14, 15, 5)

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
