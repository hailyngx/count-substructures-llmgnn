Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 5) (7, 11) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (5, 10) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 12) (2, 4) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (18, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which form 3-stars. 
From the given edges, we can see the following potential 3-stars:
<11, (16, 10, 7)>
<11, (16, 10, 13)>
<16, (11, 0, 13)>
<16, (11, 13, 9)>
<14, (3, 8, 4)>
<17, (19, 8, 3)>
<1, (13, 12, 18)>
<3, (14, 0, 6)>
<10, (11, 6, 12)>
<10, (11, 12, 5)>
<6, (3, 10, 19)>
<0, (16, 3, 4)>
<19, (17, 5, 6)>
<4, (14, 0, 2)>
<8, (17, 14, 9)>
<9, (16, 8, 15)>
<15, (9, 4, 15)>
<18, (1, 12, 18)>
<13, (11, 16, 19)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. 
There are 18 unique 3-stars found in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [18].
