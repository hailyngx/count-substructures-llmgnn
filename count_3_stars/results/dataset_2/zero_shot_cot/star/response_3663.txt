Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

1. Node 1:
- (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 7)
Thus, <1, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (5, 3, 7)>, <1, (5, 2, 7)>, <1, (6, 3, 2)>, <1, (6, 3, 7)>, <1, (6, 2, 7)>, <1, (3, 2, 7)>.

2. Node 3:
- (3, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2)
Thus, <3, (1, 0, 2)>.

3. Node 4:
- (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 2)
Thus, <4, (9, 6, 8)>, <4, (9, 6, 0)>, <4, (9, 6, 2)>, <4, (9, 8, 0)>, <4, (9, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 0, 2)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>, <4, (6, 8, 2)>, <4, (6, 0, 2)>, <4, (8, 0, 2)>.

5. Node 5:
- (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 7)
Thus, <5, (9, 1, 0)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 0, 7)>, <5, (1, 0, 7)>.

6. Node 7:
- (7, 5), (7, 1), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 2)
Thus, <7, (5, 1, 8)>, <7, (5, 1, 0)>, <7, (5, 1, 2)>, <7, (5, 8, 0)>, <7, (5, 8, 2)>, <7, (5, 0, 2)>, <7, (1, 8, 0)>, <7, (1, 8, 2)>, <7, (1, 0, 2)>, <7, (8, 0, 2)>.

[The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 27.]
