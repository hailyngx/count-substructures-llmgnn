Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 11) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges. These nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars.

Examining the given edges, we can identify the following nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:

- Node 5: (9, 2, 8)
- Node 9: (5, 8, 4)
- Node 4: (9, 7, 1)
- Node 7: (9, 4, ??) [Node 7 is missing one connected edge to form a 3-star]
- Node 6: (10, 8, 0)
- Node 8: (5, 9, 6)
- Node 0: (6, 8, 13)
- Node 14: (3, 1, 13)
- Node 13: (5, 0, 14)
- Node 3: (14, 11, 10)
- Node 11: (9, 13, 3)
- Node 1: (4, 14, 13)
- Node 10: (5, 6, 3)
- Node 12: (3, 11, 1)
- Node 2: (5, 9, 10)

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars formed by the nodes identified above.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0]. 

(Note: There are no complete 3-stars in this graph since there is only one node missing an edge connection to form a 3-star.)
