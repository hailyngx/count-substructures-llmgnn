Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the possible 3-stars: 
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 0)>
<8, (6, 2, 7)>
<2, (3, 0, 8)>
<0, (9, 7, 1)>

Now, calculate the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Counting the unique 3-stars gives us the answer:
