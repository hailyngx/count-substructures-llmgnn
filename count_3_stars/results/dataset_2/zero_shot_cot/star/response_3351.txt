Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 19) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 16) (18, 15) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 16) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 10) (7, 14) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 11) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 19) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 16) (8, 15) (8, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes in the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (2, 6, 16)>
<15, (8, 12, 18)>
<14, (0, 2, 7)>
<17, (1, 9, 10)>
<5, (9, 13, 17)>
<9, (10, 11, 17)>
<18, (4, 16, 19)>
<13, (5, 10, 3)>
<7, (2, 14, 6)>
<1, (10, 17, 5)>
<12, (11, 4, 15)>
<16, (4, 18, 19)>
<2, (3, 6, 14)>
<19, (16, 18, 0)>
<8, (10, 15, 5)>
<11, (6, 9, 12)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
[16]
