Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (14, 10) (14, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, we will identify the nodes that are directly connected to the center node with an edge. These nodes will be the leaves of our 3-star graphs.
Looking at the given edges, we find the nodes directly connected to node 6 (center node) are: 1, 2, 3, and 11.
Next, we will check each potential 3-star combination using these leaves to see if they form a valid 3-star in the graph.

1. Possible 3-star combinations with center node 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 11)>, <6, (1, 3, 11)>, <6, (2, 3, 11)>

   Out of these, the only valid 3-star is <6, (1, 2, 3)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
