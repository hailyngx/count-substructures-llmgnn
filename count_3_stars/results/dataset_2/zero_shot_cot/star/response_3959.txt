Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 12) (4, 24) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 10) (0, 27) (0, 17) (27, 0) (27, 24) (27, 26) (27, 8) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 29) (23, 25) (23, 1) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 2) (29, 9) (29, 22) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 3) (26, 27) (26, 19) (16, 28) (16, 18) (16, 10) (20, 22) (20, 12) (20, 21) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 16) (21, 19) (21, 20) (21, 13) (21, 2) (1, 23) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (8, 9) (8, 27) (8, 1) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 21) (13, 2) (13, 14) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 24) (15, 5) (15, 12) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 1) (3, 19) (14, 22) (14, 8) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 15) (24, 4) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 25) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 25) (25, 23) (25, 24) (25, 18) (2, 28) (2, 21) (2, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (17, 27, 8)>
<1, (6, 11, 8)>
<2, (13, 21, 28)>
<3, (19, 11, 25)>
<4, (10, 17, 24)>
<5, (10, 15, 5)>
<6, (1, 13, 28)>
<7, (10, 11, 7)>
<8, (1, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 12, 29)>
<10, (5, 7, 10)>
<11, (1, 19, 7)>
<12, (9, 15, 20)>
<13, (2, 13, 21)>
<14, (8, 13, 22)>
<15, (5, 12, 24)>
<16, (10, 16, 28)>
<17, (0, 17, 24)>
<18, (6, 16, 25)>
<19, (3, 11, 21)>
<20, (12, 20, 22)>
<21, (2, 13, 19)>
<22, (14, 20, 29)>
<23, (1, 25, 23)>
<24, (4, 17, 27)>
<25, (18, 23, 24)>
<26, (19, 26, 27)>
<27, (0, 24, 26)>
<28, (2, 16, 28)>
<29, (9, 22, 29)>

Therefore, there are 29 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the final count of 3-stars is [29].
