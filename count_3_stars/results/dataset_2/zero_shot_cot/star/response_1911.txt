Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 11) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes (including the central node) as leaves in a 3-star.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
<1, (9, 2, 14)>
<2, (1, 8, 10)>
<3, (6, 7, 11)>
<5, (8, 6, 13)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 8, 14)>
<10, (2, 8, 0)>
<11, (5, 3, 13)>
<13, (11, 6, 5)>
<14, (9, 4, 1)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars found: 9 in total.
Therefore, the final answer is [9].
