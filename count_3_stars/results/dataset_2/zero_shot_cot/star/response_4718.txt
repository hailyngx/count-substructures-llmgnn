Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 13) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 0) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 0) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 12) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves in the graph:

- Node 1: (1, 3, 14), (1, 8, 10) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 2: (2, 4, 9), (2, 11, 13) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 3: (3, 1, 9), (3, 7, 13), (3, 5, 4) -> 3 3-stars
- Node 4: (4, 2, 11), (4, 3, 13) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 5: (5, 0, 12), (5, 3, 10) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 6: (6, 0, 8) -> 1 3-star
- Node 7: (7, 3, 11), (7, 10, 6) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 8: (8, 1, 14), (8, 6, 0) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 9: (9, 2, 10), (9, 1, 3) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 10: (10, 1, 14), (10, 9, 5), (10, 7, 3) -> 3 3-stars
- Node 11: (11, 2, 4), (11, 7, 3) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 12: (12, 0, 5), (12, 13, 14) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 13: (13, 2, 12), (13, 1, 3) -> 2 3-stars
- Node 14: (14, 1, 8), (14, 12, 10) -> 2 3-stars

Now, calculate the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 27
