Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) 

Response:
First, find all the nodes connected to node 4 to identify potential 3-stars.
- Nodes connected to node 4: {2, 9, 0, 1, 6}

Next, for each node connected to node 4, check if it forms a 3-star:
1. Node 2: Connected to {4, 7, 5, 1, 0}, which forms 3-stars <2, (4, 7, 5)> and <2, (4, 1, 0)>.
2. Node 9: Connected to {4, 8, 0, 3}, which forms 3-star <9, (4, 8, 3)>.
3. Node 0: Connected to {4, 7, 6, 2, 9}, which forms 3-stars <0, (4, 7, 6)> and <0, (4, 9, 8)>.
4. Node 1: Connected to {4, 5, 6, 2, 8}, which forms 3-star <1, (4, 5, 6)>.
5. Node 6: Connected to {4, 5, 1, 0}, which forms 3-star <6, (4, 5, 1)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
Unique 3-stars found: <2, (4, 7, 5)>, <2, (4, 1, 0)>, <9, (4, 8, 3)>, <0, (4, 7, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>.
