Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 3) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 18) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 18) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 1) (16, 14) (16, 3) (16, 18) (16, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 4) (15, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 18) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 4) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges. Let's list all the nodes that are connected to any other node with exactly three edges.

Nodes with 3 edges: (8, 13, 11, 17, 4)

Next, we need to check if these nodes form 3-stars. We will look for combinations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the 3-stars found:

<8, (13, 11, 17)>
<13, (8, 3, 4)>
<10, (6, 3, 19)>
<17, (8, 9, 18)>
<7, (12, 15, 14)>
<12, (7, 18, 16)>
<14, (7, 0, 16)>
<5, (19, 2, 1)>
<16, (14, 3, 18)>
<2, (5, 1, 6)>
<1, (19, 2, 4)>
<11, (8, 2, 4)>
<15, (7, )>  (not a 3-star as it has only two connections)

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [12]
