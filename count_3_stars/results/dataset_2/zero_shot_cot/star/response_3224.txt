Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 18) (26, 21) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 2) (14, 11) (14, 22) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 5) (18, 26) (18, 15) (18, 22) (18, 12) (22, 14) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 27) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 1) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (5, 17) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 4) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 10) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 27) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 0) (20, 15) (20, 23) (20, 7) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 27) (1, 17) (1, 8) (1, 19) (29, 9) (29, 16) (19, 22) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 0) (24, 11) (24, 7) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 29) (25, 6) (25, 13) (13, 3) (13, 25) (13, 10) (7, 20) (7, 24) (7, 27) (0, 28) (0, 19) (4, 6) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 13) (27, 22) (27, 21) (27, 11) (27, 7) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's first list out all the 3-stars in the graph:

<9, (26, 10, 12)>
<26, (9, 18, 21)>
<3, (10, 16, 13)>
<15, (20, 18, 2)>
<14, (11, 22, 0)>
<17, (1, 16, 5)>
<22, (14, 18, 19)>
<8, (23, 19, 28)>
<23, (8, 20, 12)>
<5, (17, 6, 1)>
<6, (5, 25, 4)>
<2, (15, 8, 10)>
<21, (26, 28, 27)>
<28, (8, 21, 0)>
<20, (15, 23, 7)>
<11, (14, 27, 24)>
<1, (17, 8, 19)>
<29, (9, 16, 0)>
<24, (11, 7, 0)>
<19, (22, 8, 1)>
<13, (3, 25, 10)>
<7, (20, 24, 27)>
<0, (28, 19, 24)>
<4, (6, 25, 10)>
