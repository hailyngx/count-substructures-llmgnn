Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (10, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 13) (2, 5) (2, 12) (8, 9) (8, 14) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 1) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 14) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
The central node must have degree 3 in a 3-star graph. Let's identify all the nodes with degree 3 in the given graph:

- Node 11 has degree 4
- Node 16 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 3
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 10 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 4
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 2
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 17 has degree 3
- Node 19 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 2
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 12 has degree 3
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 14 has degree 3
- Node 18 has degree 3
- Node 15 has degree 5
- Node 13 has degree 4

Therefore, the nodes that can be the central nodes in a 3-star graph are: 4, 1, 17, 19, 12, 14, 18. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
Number of 3-stars = number of central nodes * 3 = 7 * 3 = 21.

So, there are 21 3-stars in the given graph. 

<[4, (15, 17, 13)], [1, (0, 18, 15)], [17, (1, 4, 15)], [19, (0, 5, 12)], [12, (2, 15, 19)], [14, (8, 15, 13)], [18, (1, 10, 6)]> = [21]
