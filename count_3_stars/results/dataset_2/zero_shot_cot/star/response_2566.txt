Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 6) (16, 18) (16, 15) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 13) (26, 10) (26, 6) (26, 7) (26, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 18) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 1) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 29) (22, 7) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 7) (23, 28) (15, 16) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 24) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 10) (17, 9) (17, 29) (17, 24) (29, 22) (29, 17) (29, 25) (28, 9) (28, 23) (28, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 25) (7, 26) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 0) (7, 2) (3, 0) (3, 21) (3, 27) (3, 18) (21, 22) (21, 3) (10, 26) (10, 20) (10, 1) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 2) (12, 26) (12, 4) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 4) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 23) (5, 28) (5, 2) (6, 11) (6, 26) (14, 4) (14, 27) (27, 20) (27, 3) (27, 14) (1, 13) (1, 10) (24, 15) (24, 17) (18, 16) (18, 8) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 7, 3, 25
Node 1: 13, 10
Node 2: 7, 4, 5
Node 3: 0, 21, 27, 18
Node 4: 12, 14, 25, 2
Node 5: 23, 28, 2
Node 6: 11, 26
Node 7: 26, 22, 23, 0, 2
Node 8: 13, 19, 18
Node 9: 28, 17, 13
Node 10: 26, 20, 1
Node 11: 13, 6
Node 12: 26, 4
Node 13: 11, 8, 1, 9
Node 14: 4, 27
Node 15: 16, 22, 20, 24
Node 16: 18, 15
Node 17: 9, 29, 24
Node 18: 16, 8, 3
Node 19: 8
Node 20: 15, 27, 10
Node 21: 22, 3
Node 22: 23, 15, 29, 7, 21
Node 23: 22, 5, 7, 28
Node 24: 15, 17
Node 25: 29, 0, 4
Node 26: 10, 6, 7, 12
Node 27: 20, 3, 14
Node 28: 9, 23, 5
Node 29: 22, 17, 25

Now let's identify the 3-stars. 
We have noticed that every 3-star must have one leaf connected by an edge to every other leaf, such as (Node A, Node B, Node C) where A is the central node and B, C are leaves. 
We first list down all possible 3-stars and then count how many times they appear.

<1, (10, 13, 8)>
<1, (13, 11, 9)>
<1, (13, 9, 8)>
<1, (10, 13, 1)>
<1, (13, 9, 8)>
<2, (7, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 12, 14)>
<2, (7, 23, 22)>
<3, (0, 7, 2)>
<3, (7, 22, 23)>
<3, (3, 21, 18)>
<4, (14, 4, 2)>
<4, (4, 12, 25)>
<5, (23, 5, 28)>
<6, (6, 11, 26)>
<7, (22, 23, 29)>
<8, (13, 9, 17)>
<9, (9, 13, 8)>
<10, (10, 26, 20)>
<11, (1, 13, 10)>
<12, (4, 12, 26)>
<13, (8, 13, 19)>
<14, (27, 20, 15)>
<15, (20, 15, 24)>
<16, (18, 16, 15)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get 16. 
Thus, the final answer is [16].
