Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the nodes that are connected in the specific way required for a 3-star. In this case, we are looking for a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
1. Node 5:
    - Connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9. Forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 6, 4. <5, (1, 6, 4)>
2. Node 9:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6. Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 5, 6. <9, (0, 5, 6)>
3. Node 6:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 8, 9, and 5. Forms 3-stars with nodes 0, 8, 9. <6, (0, 8, 9)>
4. Node 4:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 3, and 5. Forms a 3-star with central node 5. <4, (0, 3, 5)>
5. Node 8:
    - Connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 6. Forms a 3-star with central node 6. <8, (0, 2, 6)>
6. Node 2:
    - Connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Forms 3-stars with nodes 1, 7, 8. <2, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
