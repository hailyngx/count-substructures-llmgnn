Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that share exactly three edges with other nodes.

<0, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 3, 7)>
<2, (5, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 0)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<7, (9, 1, 8)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: [10].
