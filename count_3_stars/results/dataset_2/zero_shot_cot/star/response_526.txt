Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (9, 3, 8)>
2. <3, (1, 5, 11)>
3. <7, (9, 0, 14)>
4. <9, (1, 7, 14)>
5. <13, (8, 11, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
