Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 7) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 3) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 3) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. For each node, count the number of edges connected to it. 

Node 0 has 4 edges connected to it.
Node 1 has 4 edges connected to it.
Node 2 has 4 edges connected to it.
Node 3 has 5 edges connected to it.
Node 4 has 2 edges connected to it.
Node 5 has 5 edges connected to it.
Node 6 has 5 edges connected to it.
Node 7 has 4 edges connected to it.
Node 8 has 5 edges connected to it.
Node 9 has 4 edges connected to it.
Node 10 has 4 edges connected to it.
Node 11 has 4 edges connected to it.
Node 12 has 6 edges connected to it.
Node 13 has 2 edges connected to it.
Node 14 has 3 edges connected to it.

Now, let's find the 3-stars. 

<5, (0, 7, 11)>
<6, (9, 10, 2)>
<8, (1, 3, 13)>
<10, (0, 3, 7)>
<11, (5, 6, 14)>
<12, (9, 7, 13)>

So, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
