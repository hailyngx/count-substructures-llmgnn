Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes (nodes with exactly three edges connected to them). 

Nodes with three edges connected to them: 
- Node 6
- Node 9
- Node 1
- Node 8
- Node 0
- Node 7

Now, let's identify the 3-stars based on these center nodes:
- For node 6: <6, (9, 5, 0)>
- For node 9: <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>
- For node 1: <1, (9, 2, 0)>
- For node 8: <8, (9, 1, 5)>, <8, (2, 7, 0)>
- For node 0: <0, (6, 1, 3)>, <0, (8, 7, 6)>
- For node 7: <7, (9, 3, 5)>, <7, (8, 0, 5)>

Therefore, there are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final count is [9].
