Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 10.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 12.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 10.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 13.

2. Based on the identified nodes, we can form the following 3-stars:
- <1, (2, 3, 13)>
- <3, (1, 7, 10)>
- <4, (0, 6, 12)>
- <5, (6, 8, 13)>
- <6, (4, 5, 10)>
- <9, (1, 7, 10)>
- <11, (1, 10, 13)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [7].
