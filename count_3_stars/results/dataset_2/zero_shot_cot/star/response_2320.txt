Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Given graph:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: 
  - (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 7), (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 0), (6, 1), (6, 0), (4, 9), (4, 8), (4, 3), (4, 1), (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 8), (8, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (8, 0), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 2), (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 6), (0, 8)

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<5, (9, 2, 1)>
<5, (9, 1, 0)>
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<9, (5, 4, 0)>
<6, (1, 0, 5)>
<4, (9, 8, 3)>
<4, (9, 3, 1)>
<7, (5, 3, 1)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<8, (9, 4, 7)>
<8, (9, 7, 0)>
<1, (5, 6, 4)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>

Thus, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
