Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all vertices connected to exactly three other vertices. These vertices will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Upon examining the list of edges, we can identify the nodes with exactly three incident edges:
- Node 5 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to 0, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 6.

Now, we can identify the 3-stars:
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <6, (0, 4, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
