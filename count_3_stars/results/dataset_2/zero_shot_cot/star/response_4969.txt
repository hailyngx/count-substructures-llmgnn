Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 24) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 17) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 14) (24, 2) (20, 21) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 4) (22, 4) (22, 27) (23, 2) (23, 27) (23, 16) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 1) (21, 20) (21, 28) (21, 10) (28, 21) (28, 9) (28, 18) (5, 12) (5, 29) (5, 14) (13, 16) (1, 25) (1, 12) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 9) (18, 24) (18, 28) (18, 26) (18, 19) (26, 18) (26, 6) (19, 18) (19, 14) (10, 12) (10, 21) (10, 6) (10, 2) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 15) (16, 23) (16, 13) (16, 0) (4, 24) (4, 25) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 15) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 3) (3, 17) (3, 29) (11, 15) (8, 14) (8, 15) (14, 24) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 8) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 4) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (27, 22) (27, 23) (27, 2) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 10) (2, 24) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 27) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the edges provided, let's identify the 3-stars:

<7, (24, 12, 15)>
<24, (7, 4, 18)>
<25, (1, 6, 4)>
<12, (7, 5, 10)>
<21, (20, 28, 10)>
<28, (21, 9, 18)>
<5, (12, 29, 14)>
<17, (7, 3, 9)>
<18, (24, 28, 26)>
<10, (12, 21, 6)>
<16, (23, 13, 0)>
<4, (24, 25, 22)>
<29, (5, 0, 3)>
<15, (7, 0, 4)>
<14, (24, 5, 19)>
<9, (28, 17, 4)>
<27, (22, 23, 2)>
<6, (25, 26, 10)>
<2, (24, 23, 10)>
<0, (16, 29, 15)>
<3, (17, 29, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21].
