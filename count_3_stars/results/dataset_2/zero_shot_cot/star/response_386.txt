Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 4) (16, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 19) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 19) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 18) (4, 16) (4, 18) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 15) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 2) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 2) (19, 9) (19, 12) (19, 2) (2, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 19) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (8, 16) (8, 3) (6, 15) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 15)>
<2, (13, 15, 17)>
<3, (9, 11, 17)>
<4, (14, 16, 18)>
<5, (0, 1, 13)>
<7, (0, 1, 17)>
<8, (3, 16, 8)>
<9, (3, 10, 19)>
<10, (3, 7, 9)>
<11, (9, 15, 16)>
<13, (2, 5, 17)>
<15, (1, 2, 6)>
<16, (4, 8, 11)>
<17, (3, 5, 7)>
<18, (4, 11, 14)>
<19, (2, 9, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
