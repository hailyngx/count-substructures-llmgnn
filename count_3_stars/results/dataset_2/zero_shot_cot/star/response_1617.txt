Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 16) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 0) (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 3) (7, 18) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 0) (22, 28) (20, 13) (20, 27) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 28) (8, 25) (8, 19) (8, 29) (13, 20) (13, 14) (12, 27) (12, 3) (12, 1) (27, 20) (27, 12) (27, 17) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 21) (21, 4) (21, 2) (21, 23) (28, 22) (28, 25) (28, 17) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 3) (24, 0) (5, 19) (5, 1) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 10) (10, 19) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 26) (15, 10) (15, 29) (15, 16) (29, 9) (29, 8) (29, 15) (11, 26) (11, 24) (11, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 24) (23, 21) (23, 16) (17, 27) (17, 28) (0, 26) (0, 18) (0, 25) (0, 24) (0, 1) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 0) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 10) (16, 9) (16, 20) (16, 15) (16, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll first identify all the possible 3-stars present.

There are various 3-star patterns that can be formed in the graph based on the provided edges. Let's list them:

<0, (18, 24, 25)>
<1, (0, 5, 12)>
<2, (3, 6, 21)>
<3, (2, 7, 24)>
<4, (6, 21, 23)>
<5, (1, 19, 12)>
<6, (2, 4, 11)>
<7, (3, 12, 18)>
<8, (25, 19, 29)>
<9, (16, 29, 9)>
<10, (14, 15, 19)>
<11, (6, 24, 26)>
<12, (1, 3, 27)>
<13, (14, 20, 13)>
<14, (10, 13, 15)>
<15, (10, 14, 16)>
<16, (9, 15, 20)>
<17, (27, 28, 17)>
<18, (0, 2, 7)>
<19, (5, 8, 10)>
<20, (13, 16, 27)>
<21, (2, 4, 6)>
<22, (28, 23, 22)>
<23, (16, 21, 23)>
<24, (0, 3, 11)>
<25, (0, 8, 28)>
<26, (11, 24, 26)>
<27, (12, 17, 20)>
<28, (17, 22, 25)>
<29, (9, 15, 29)>

There are [29] unique 3-stars in the graph.
