Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 6) (14, 3) (14, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify them by finding nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 14.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 2.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 11.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 14.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 6.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <7, (4, 10, 1)>
- <4, (9, 7, 6)>
- <1, (7, 3, 0)>
- <3, (4, 1, 14)>
- <13, (5, 8, 2)>
- <12, (9, 7, 11)>
- <6, (4, 1, 14)>
- <0, (7, 1, 12)>
- <10, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (9, 13, 6)>

3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10]
