Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 14) (4, 19) (4, 13) (8, 5) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 10) (18, 15) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 11) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 16) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 3) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 5) (11, 0) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 12) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 16) (10, 14) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 15) (12, 11) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as follows:

Firstly, let's identify all the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes can potentially be the central nodes of 3-stars.

The nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 6, 9, 4, 13, 15, 19, 3, 11, 5, 10, 16

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars using each of these nodes as the center:
- Node 6: <6, (9, 12, 13)>
- Node 9: <9, (6, 15, 14)>
- Node 4: <4, (19, 13, 16)>
- Node 13: <13, (6, 4, 16)>
- Node 15: <15, (9, 18, 19)>
- Node 19: <19, (4, 15, 11)>
- Node 3: <3, (0, 17, 19)>
- Node 11: <11, (0, 17, 19)>
- Node 5: <5, (8, 3, 16)>
- Node 10: <10, (14, 16, 10)>
- Node 16: <16, (13, 5, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
