Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 6) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 14) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 1) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 12) (19, 0) (19, 12) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 16) (16, 5) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (3, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 15) (12, 19) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 18, and 11: <10, (2, 18, 11)>
2. Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 18, and 9: <11, (10, 18, 9)>
3. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 13, and 17: <5, (6, 13, 17)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 2, and 12: <6, (5, 2, 12)>
5. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 6, and 15: <2, (10, 6, 15)>
6. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 13, and 1: <17, (5, 13, 1)>
7. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 13, and 15: <12, (6, 13, 15)>
8. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 17, and 9: <13, (5, 17, 9)>
9. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 15, and 14: <1, (17, 15, 14)>
10. Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 0, and 7: <16, (5, 0, 7)>
11. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 13, and 14: <9, (11, 13, 14)>

There are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [11].
