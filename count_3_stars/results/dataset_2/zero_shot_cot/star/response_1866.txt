Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures as follows:
<0, (5, 4, 1)>
<2, (7, 4, 5)>
<1, (4, 6, 0)>
<5, (8, 2, 1)>
<7, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (3, 7, 1)>
