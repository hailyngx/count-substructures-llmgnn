Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 18) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 20) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 14) (17, 29) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 27) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 18) (13, 26) (13, 28) (13, 19) (26, 3) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 2) (28, 13) (28, 26) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 12) (25, 5) (18, 7) (18, 29) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 16) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 5) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 1) (2, 21) (22, 27) (22, 6) (12, 11) (12, 19) (12, 23) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 22) (6, 27) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (24, 17) (24, 21) (21, 2) (21, 24) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 14) (27, 17) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 21) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 19) (5, 29) (5, 25) (5, 16) (23, 12) (23, 21) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 10) (14, 20) (14, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars: 
Nodes with degree 4: 4, 7, 8, 11, 18, 26
Nodes with degree 3: 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29

Next, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 4: 3-stars <4, (7, 8, 11)> and <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: 3-stars <7, (4, 1, 18)>
- Node 8: 3-star <8, (4, 20, 10)>
- Node 11: 3-star <11, (4, 0, 12)>
- Node 18: 3-stars <18, (7, 29, 16)> and <18, (26, 10, 19)>
- Node 26: 3-stars <26, (3, 13, 18)> and <26, (13, 2, 28)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<4, (7, 8, 11)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 1, 18)>, <8, (4, 20, 10)>, <11, (4, 0, 12)>, <18, (7, 29, 16)>, <18, (26, 10, 19)>, <26, (3, 13, 18)>, and <26, (13, 2, 28)>.
