Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 6) (16, 10) (14, 11) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 8) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 15) (5, 13) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 19) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 2) (0, 16) (0, 8) (9, 7) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 6) (2, 17) (2, 15) (2, 4) (19, 3) (19, 13) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (6, 16) (6, 18) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<11, (10, 12, 14)>
<16, (0, 6, 10)>
<1, (3, 7, 17)>
<3, (1, 4, 17)>
<7, (1, 12, 18)>
<18, (5, 6, 15)>
