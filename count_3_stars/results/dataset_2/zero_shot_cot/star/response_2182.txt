Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 19) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 15) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (4, 10) (4, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 7) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 0) (0, 6) (0, 19) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 19) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 7) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 10) 

Response:
There are multiple 3-stars in this graph. Let's find them step by step.

Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 connections:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 13, and 16.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 17, and 19.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 14, and 18.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 17, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 12, and 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 12, and 18.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 12, 16, and 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 9.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 10, and 11.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 16, and 5.

Step 2: From the identified nodes, we can see the following 3-stars:
<[1, (2, 13, 16)]> - 3-star with central node 1 and leaves 2, 13, 16.
<[3, (4, 17, 19)]> - 3-star with central node 3 and leaves 4, 17, 19.
<[5, (2, 7, 18)]> - 3-star with central node 5 and leaves 2, 7, 18.
<[7, (6, 10, 18)]> - 3-star with central node 7 and leaves 6, 10, 18.
<[8, (2, 12, 14)]> - 3-star with central node 8 and leaves 2, 12, 14.
<[10, (4, 7, 12)]> - 3-star with central node 10 and leaves 4, 7, 12.
<[11, (12, 16, 18)]> - 3-star with central node 11 and leaves 12, 16, 18.
<[13, (1, 14, 15)]> - 3-star with central node 13 and leaves 1, 14, 15.
<[16, (1, 11, 19)]> - 3-star with central node 16 and leaves 1, 11, 19.
<[18, (5, 7, 11)]> - 3-star with central node 18 and leaves 5, 7, 11.

Step 3: Count the number of 3-stars found.
There are 9 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
