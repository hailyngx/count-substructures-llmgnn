Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 16) (15, 10) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 0) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 10) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (18, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 11) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 16) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (5, 8) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 19) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 14) (16, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 19) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 11) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges since they can potentially be the center of a 3-star.
2. For each of these nodes:
   - List all possible 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.
   - Ensure that the leaves of the 3-star are connected to the center node directly and do not form a cycle among themselves.

Nodes with exactly 3 incident edges: 0, 11, 12, 15

- For node 0:
  <0, (2, 9, 14)>
  
- For node 11:
  <11, (0, 4, 12)>
  <11, (4, 12, 19)>
  
- For node 12:
  <12, (7, 11, 13)>
  
- For node 15:
  <15, (10, 16, 17)>
