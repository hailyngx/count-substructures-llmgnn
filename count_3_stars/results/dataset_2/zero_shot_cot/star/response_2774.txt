Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (6, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 4) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes with three incident edges since each 3-star must have a central node with exactly three edges.

Nodes with three incident edges:
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 8
- Node 13
- Node 14

Next, we will list the 3-stars in the graph. 

<1, (5, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 1, 12)>
<13, (9, 8, 6)>
<14, (9, 1, 11)>

Now, count the number of 3-stars:

[5]
