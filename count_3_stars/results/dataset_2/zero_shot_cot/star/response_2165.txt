Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 17) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 9) (17, 10) (17, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 1) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 11) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (19, 3) (19, 11) (19, 14) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 6) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (6, 13, 15)>
<5, (0, 9, 12)>
<9, (2, 17, 18)>
<12, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<17, (8, 9, 10)>
<8, (1, 2, 17)>
<4, (11, 12, 18)>
<0, (5, 7, 13)>
<11, (4, 19, 2)>
<18, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 14)>
<6, (3, 12, 16)>
<19, (3, 11, 14)>
<14, (1, 12, 19)>
<10, (8, 17, 2)>
<7, (0, 13, 5)>
<16, (6, 12, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
