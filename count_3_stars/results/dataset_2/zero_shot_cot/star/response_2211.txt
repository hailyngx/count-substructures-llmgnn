Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 7) 

Response:
First, let's look for all nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes to identify the 3-stars. Then we will count them. 

Nodes with 3 connections: 
- Node 6 (connected to 1, 3, and 2)
- Node 1 (connected to 6, 9, and 3)
- Node 3 (connected to 6, 1, and 0)
- Node 4 (connected to 6, 8, and 0)
- Node 8 (connected to 9, 3, and 4)
- Node 0 (connected to 9, 3, and 4)
- Node 7 (connected to 1, 8, and 0)
- Node 2 (connected to 6, 9, and 7)
- Node 5 (connected to 8, and 7)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (6, 9, 3)>
<3, (6, 1, 0)>
<4, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (9, 3, 4)>
<0, (9, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 8, 0)>
<2, (6, 9, 7)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [7].
