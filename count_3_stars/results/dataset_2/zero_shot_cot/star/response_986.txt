Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Nodes with degree 4 are potential centers for 3-stars. Let's list them down:
<5>, <4>, <7>, <8>, <13>, <0>, <3>, <14>, <11>, <1>, <6>, <2>, <12>

Now, let's list the 3-stars with each of these potential centers:

<5, (13, 4, 0)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<4, (5, 7, 3)>
<7, (4, 0, 11)>
<6, (9, 14, 3)>
<8, (9, 7, 14)>
<13, (5, 7, 2)>
<2, (7, 13, 0)>
<0, (5, 7, 2)>
<3, (9, 4, 6)>
<11, (7, 0, 1)>
<12, (8, 3, 14)>
<1, (9, 0, 11)>
<14, (5, 6, 8)>
<10, (9, 14, 13)>

The unique 3-stars are <5, (13, 4, 0)>, <9, (6, 8, 10)>, <4, (5, 7, 3)>, <7, (4, 0, 11)>, <6, (9, 14, 3)>, <8, (9, 7, 14)>, <13, (5, 7, 2)>, <2, (7, 13, 0)>, <12, (8, 3, 14)>, <1, (9, 0, 11)>.

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
