Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 1) (15, 4) (2, 13) (2, 9) (12, 10) (12, 19) (14, 6) (14, 8) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (4, 0) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (19, 7) (19, 12) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 12) (18, 16) (18, 0) (18, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

The 3-stars present in the graph are:
<1, (5, 9, 10)>
<2, (9, 13, 2)>
<3, (4, 8, 13)>
<4, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 10, 13)>
<6, (14, 16, 17)>
<7, (0, 7, 18)>
<8, (3, 8, 17)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
<10, (5, 10, 12)>
<11, (16, 17, 18)>
<12, (10, 12, 19)>
<13, (2, 3, 13)>
<14, (6, 8, 14)>
<15, (1, 4, 15)>
<16, (6, 16, 18)>
<17, (6, 8, 17)>
<18, (0, 7, 18)>
<19, (7, 12, 19)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [19].
