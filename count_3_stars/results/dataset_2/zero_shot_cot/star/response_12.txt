Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes of the 3-stars. Since each 3-star has one central node, we will look for nodes with exactly three incident edges. 

The nodes that satisfy this condition are: 5, 9, 4, 14, 1, and 3.

Next, let's find the leaves of each 3-star by checking which nodes are connected to the center nodes identified above. We will then count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

<5, (9, 13, 11)>
<9, (5, 14, 7)>
<4, (13, 1, 3)>
<14, (5, 11, 2)>
<1, (4, 3, 10)>
<3, (5, 4, 13)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
