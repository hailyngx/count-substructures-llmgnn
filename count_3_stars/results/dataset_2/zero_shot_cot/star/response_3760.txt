Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 2) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
By observing the given graph, we can identify the 3-stars as follows: 

<5, (8, 11, 4)>
<9, (6, 8, 10)>
<4, (7, 10, 11)>
<7, (14, 13, 8)>
<6, (9, 14, -)>
<1, (3, 10, 12)>
<11, (5, 4, 7)>
<12, (1, 10, 14)>
<2, (10, 11, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (3, 8, 14)>
<14, (7, 6, 1)>
<13, (7, 3, 0)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
