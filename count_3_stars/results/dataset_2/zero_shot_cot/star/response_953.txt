Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 22) (16, 10) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 15) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 23) (14, 27) (14, 12) (14, 24) (2, 5) (17, 18) (17, 21) (6, 28) (6, 24) (6, 8) (28, 6) (28, 3) (28, 9) (28, 18) (9, 28) (9, 8) (22, 16) (22, 8) (3, 11) (3, 20) (3, 28) (3, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 19) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 19) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 24) (19, 23) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 25) (8, 1) (18, 20) (18, 17) (18, 28) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 19) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 25) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 23) (29, 26) (29, 21) (27, 14) (26, 29) (26, 12) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 23) (23, 20) (23, 19) (23, 1) (23, 15) (25, 8) (25, 10) (25, 21) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 26) (12, 21) (21, 17) (21, 29) (21, 25) (21, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify the nodes that can act as centers for 3-stars by checking which nodes have exactly 3 incident edges. 

After examining the given graph, we find that nodes 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 28 have 3 incident edges each. Therefore, these nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<3, (11, 20, 28)>
<5, (2, 11, 19)>
<7, (13, 16, 1)>
<8, (1, 9, 22)>
<10, (0, 15, 25)>
<28, (6, 9, 18)>

There are [6] 3-stars in total.
