Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 10) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 7) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the unique configurations where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0:
<0, (9, 13, 10)>

2. Node 1:
<1, (13, 11, 14)>

3. Node 2:
<2, (9, 3, 11)>

4. Node 3:
<3, (6, 0, 14)>
<3, (2, 11, 14)>

5. Node 4:
<4, (8, 11, 5)>

6. Node 5:
<5, (6, 11, 10)>

7. Node 6:
<6, (3, 5, 7)>

8. Node 7:
<7, (6, 8, 14)>

9. Node 8:
<8, (13, 10, 4)>

10. Node 9:
<9, (0, 2, 12)>

11. Node 10:
<10, (8, 5, 0)>

12. Node 11:
<11, (9, 4, 5)>

13. Node 12:
<12, (6, 9, 8)>

14. Node 13:
<13, (9, 1, 14)>

15. Node 14:
<14, (9, 1, 3)>
<14, (13, 7, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
