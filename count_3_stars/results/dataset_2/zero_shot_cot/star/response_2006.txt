Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are involved in a 3-star pattern. 
Based on the edges provided, we can see the following potential 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 3, 6)>
- <2, (5, 4, 6)>
- <3, (5, 1, 7)>
- <4, (9, 8, 6)>
- <5, (9, 2, 1)>
- <6, (4, 3, 0)>
- <7, (9, 3, 0)>
- <8, (9, 4, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
