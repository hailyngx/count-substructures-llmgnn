Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 18) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 13) (17, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 14) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 8) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 7) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 19) (5, 4) (19, 7) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 6) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 14) (6, 8) (6, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
There are several steps need to be taken to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.
Let's start by finding the degree of each node in the graph. Then we can identify the potential central nodes of 3-stars based on their degrees. 

Node degrees:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 2
- Node 10: 3
- Node 12: 2
- Node 13: 5
- Node 14: 4
- Node 15: 4
- Node 16: 3
- Node 17: 1
- Node 18: 5
- Node 19: 4

Potential central nodes for 3-stars:
- Node 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, and 19

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
- 3-stars centered at node 1: <1, (2, 3, 18)>
- 3-stars centered at node 3: <3, (1, 2, 8)>
- 3-stars centered at node 4: <4, (0, 5, 10)>
- 3-stars centered at node 8: <8, (6, 18, 3)>
- 3-stars centered at node 10: <10, (4, 13, 15)>
- 3-stars centered at node 13: <13, (9, 14, 19)>
- 3-stars centered at node 15: <15, (7, 9, 10)>
- 3-stars centered at node 18: <18, (8, 16, 14)>
- 3-stars centered at node 19: <19, (6, 13, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
