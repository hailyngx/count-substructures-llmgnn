Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 21) (26, 16) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 25) (7, 29) (7, 6) (7, 22) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 11) (27, 0) (27, 18) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 21) (22, 7) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 12) (22, 21) (20, 0) (20, 3) (20, 5) (5, 26) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 24) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 25) (1, 15) (1, 25) (17, 28) (3, 20) (3, 13) (11, 0) (11, 22) (11, 5) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 2) (19, 8) (19, 24) (25, 4) (25, 8) (25, 1) (24, 6) (24, 19) (24, 29) (10, 2) (10, 23) (12, 22) (12, 16) (12, 29) (16, 26) (16, 18) (16, 12) (16, 29) (29, 7) (29, 24) (29, 12) (29, 16) (13, 9) (13, 3) (21, 26) (21, 18) (21, 22) (14, 8) (14, 23) (14, 28) (28, 9) (28, 17) (28, 14) (28, 2) (23, 15) (23, 10) (23, 14) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the <center, (leaves)> combinations. Let's list them:

<0, (27, 20, 11)>
<2, (15, 23, 28)>
<4, (26, 25, 5)>
<5, (26, 20, 11)>
<6, (7, 5, 24)>
<8, (19, 25, 14)>
<9, (26, 28, 13)>
<10, (2, 23, 14)>
<12, (22, 16, 29)>
<15, (1, 23, 2)>
<16, (26, 18, 29)>
<18, (27, 22, 21)>
<19, (8, 24, 29)>
<20, (0, 3, 5)>
<21, (26, 18, 22)>
<22, (7, 18, 11)>
<23, (15, 10, 14)>
<24, (6, 19, 29)>
<25, (4, 8, 1)>
<26, (9, 5, 21)>
<28, (17, 14, 2)>
<29, (7, 24, 16)>
<13, (9, 3, 28)>

Counting the unique 3-stars in the graph, we find 23 unique 3-stars in total. 
So, the final answer is [23].
