Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 1) (22, 5) (22, 28) (22, 0) (22, 17) (23, 2) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 26) (18, 1) (18, 4) (18, 9) (6, 28) (28, 22) (28, 6) (28, 27) (28, 25) (13, 26) (13, 17) (13, 24) (13, 19) (26, 4) (26, 13) (26, 5) (17, 1) (17, 22) (17, 13) (17, 15) (7, 1) (7, 25) (7, 24) (7, 27) (25, 28) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 10) (20, 27) (20, 2) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 21) (29, 11) (21, 29) (21, 16) (21, 5) (5, 22) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 8) (2, 23) (2, 20) (2, 27) (2, 14) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 9) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 16) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 19) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 27) (0, 22) (0, 11) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 0) (24, 13) (24, 7) (24, 16) (8, 5) (10, 25) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 19) (14, 4) (14, 29) (14, 2) 

Response:
There are 3-star structures in this graph. Let's find them step by step:

1. A 3-star centered at node 1:
<1, (3, 7, 11)>

2. A 3-star centered at node 4:
<4, (18, 14, 26)>

3. A 3-star centered at node 5:
<5, (22, 26, 21)>

4. A 3-star centered at node 7:
<7, (1, 25, 24)>

5. A 3-star centered at node 9:
<9, (18, 25, 16)>

6. A 3-star centered at node 13:
<13, (17, 26, 19)>

7. A 3-star centered at node 15:
<15, (17, 29, 19)>

8. A 3-star centered at node 16:
<16, (21, 24, 9)>

9. A 3-star centered at node 18:
<18, (1, 4, 9)>

10. A 3-star centered at node 19:
<19, (13, 15, 27)>

11. A 3-star centered at node 21:
<21, (29, 5, 16)>

12. A 3-star centered at node 22:
<22, (5, 28, 17)>

13. A 3-star centered at node 24:
<24, (13, 7, 16)>

14. A 3-star centered at node 25:
<25, (28, 9, 10)>

15. A 3-star centered at node 26:
<26, (4, 13, 5)>

16. A 3-star centered at node 27:
<27, (22, 7, 19)>

17. A 3-star centered at node 28:
<28, (22, 6, 25)>

18. A 3-star centered at node 29:
<29, (15, 14, 11)>

Total number of 3-stars: [18]
