Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 17) (10, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 19) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars in the graph by looking at every node and checking if it is the center of a 3-star. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 16, 19)>
<1, (6, 8, 16)>
<2, (7, 12, 14)>
<3, (9, 17, 19)>
<4, (13, 15, 5)>
<5, (14, 15, 5)>
<6, (1, 8, 11)>
<7, (0, 14, 19)>
<8, (1, 6, 15)>
<9, (10, 12, 3)>
<10, (9, 17, 10)>
<11, (6, 15, 11)>
<12, (2, 9, 17)>
<13, (4, 15, 17)>
<14, (2, 5, 7)>
<15, (4, 5, 11)>
<16, (0, 1, 19)>
<17, (3, 10, 12)>
<18, (3, 9, 17)>
<19, (7, 16, 3)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars found:
[20]
