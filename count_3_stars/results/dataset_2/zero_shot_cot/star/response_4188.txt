Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 

From the given edges, we can see that the center node "5" has connections to 6 other nodes: 9, 6, 2, 1, 0, and 7. Since a 3-star has a center connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we'll check if any of these sets of 3 nodes form 3-stars by verifying if every pair of the 3 nodes has an edge connecting them with the center. 

By examining the edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 7)>
<5, (6, 1, 0)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [3].
