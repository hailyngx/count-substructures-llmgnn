Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the same central node. 
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 3, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 1, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 0, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, 0, and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 1, 3, and 0.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 8, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 2.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 7, 8, and 2.

Now, let's find the 3-stars by looking at nodes with exactly three connections to the same center.
After analyzing the connections, we find the unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 0)>
<4, (8, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 2, 0)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
