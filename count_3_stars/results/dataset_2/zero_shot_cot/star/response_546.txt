Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 10) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph using the provided edges. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<4, (8, 12, 10)>
<4, (8, 12, 6)>
<8, (4, 2, 6)>
<8, (4, 14, 1)>
<8, (2, 6, 1)>
<12, (13, 14, 11)>
<2, (8, 6, 10)>
<3, (4, 2, 11)>
<11, (3, 1, 9)>
<1, (8, 6, 5)>
<6, (4, 8, 1)>
<5, (0, 3, 1)>
<10, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (7, 0, 3)>
<7, (9, 0, -)>

To count the total number of 3-stars, we count the unique 3-stars identified above. 

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
