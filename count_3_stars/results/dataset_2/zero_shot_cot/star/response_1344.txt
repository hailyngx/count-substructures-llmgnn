Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes connected to each node to identify 3-stars.
Here are the connections for each node:
Node 0: 5, 4, 8, 2
Node 1: 5, 9, 7, 6, 2
Node 2: 4, 7, 0, 1
Node 3: 5, 9, 7, 8
Node 4: 9, 0, 6, 2
Node 5: 8, 1, 0, 3
Node 6: 9, 4, 1, 8
Node 7: 3, 2, 1
Node 8: 5, 6, 0, 3
Node 9: 6, 4, 3, 1

Now let's list the 3-stars:
<2, (4, 0, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<4, (9, 0, 6)>
<5, (8, 1, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 1)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
