Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
There are 6 3-star graphs in this given graph. 

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found:
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<3, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>

So, the final answer is [6].
