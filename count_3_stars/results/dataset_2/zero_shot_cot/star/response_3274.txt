Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 8) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 21) (29, 6) (29, 18) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 26) (6, 29) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (18, 29) (18, 22) (18, 24) (22, 14) (22, 18) (22, 21) (1, 26) (1, 13) (26, 17) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 25) (5, 26) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 13) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 25) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (23, 4) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 20) (28, 2) (28, 3) (28, 0) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 18) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 21) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 0) (20, 2) (20, 3) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 10) (10, 27) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 4) (16, 9) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 12) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 11) (12, 15) (12, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique instance where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<15, (27, 0, 13)>
<27, (15, 10, 8)>
<2, (20, 28, 21)>
<29, (6, 18, 22)>
<14, (17, 22, 19)>
<17, (14, 24, 26)>
<6, (29, 24, 3)>
<9, (6, 10, 16)>
<18, (29, 22, 24)>
<22, (14, 18, 21)>
<1, (26, 13, 5)>
<26, (17, 1, 25)>
<5, (26, 19, 7)>
<19, (14, 5, 13)>
<7, (9, 5, 25)>
<25, (26, 7, 8)>
<11, (13, 4, 0)>
<23, (4, 11, 0)>
<3, (6, 28, 20)>
<28, (2, 3, 0)>
<0, (15, 28, 21)>
<21, (2, 22, 0)>
<20, (2, 3, 4)>
<4, (11, 23, 10)>
<10, (27, 9, 19)>
<16, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (27, 25, 12)>
<12, (15, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
