Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying all 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<4, (5, 8, 6)>
<7, (5, 0, 3)>
<6, (4, 0, *)> -> The center node 6 has only two leaves instead of three, so this is not a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
