Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 14) (18, 16) (22, 15) (22, 20) (22, 21) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 27) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 27) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 24) (20, 22) (20, 15) (20, 19) (20, 10) (27, 13) (27, 23) (27, 9) (21, 22) (21, 28) (21, 26) (21, 17) (28, 21) (28, 5) (28, 10) (1, 26) (1, 9) (26, 21) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 6) (7, 25) (7, 24) (25, 7) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 2) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 17) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 17) (19, 20) (19, 24) (19, 3) (14, 18) (14, 26) (14, 3) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 11) (11, 0) (11, 5) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 19) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 14) (17, 21) (17, 0) (17, 16) (6, 26) (6, 10) (29, 23) (29, 4) (29, 25) (9, 27) (9, 1) (10, 20) (10, 28) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 4) (2, 25) (2, 10) 

Response:
The central nodes of the 3-stars can be determined by examining the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

The central nodes are: 8, 13, 23, 4, 15, 20, 27, 21, 26, 28, 5, 25, 16, 19, 14, and 6. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each central node:
- For central node 8: 1
- For central node 13: 1
- For central node 23: 1
- For central node 4: 1
- For central node 15: 1
- For central node 20: 1
- For central node 27: 1
- For central node 21: 1
- For central node 26: 1
- For central node 28: 1
- For central node 5: 1
- For central node 25: 1
- For central node 16: 1
- For central node 19: 1
- For central node 14: 1
- For central node 6: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<8, (13, 3, 27)>
<13, (8, 3, 27)>
<23, (8, 27, 29)>
<4, (8, 2, 29)>
<15, (22, 24, 20)>
<20, (22, 15, 10)>
<27, (13, 23, 9)>
<21, (22, 26, 28)>
<26, (21, 5, 6)>
<28, (21, 10, 5)>
<5, (28, 26, 25)>
<25, (5, 29, 2)>
<16, (18, 17, 0)>
<19, (20, 24, 3)>
<14, (18, 26, 3)>
<6, (26, 10, 28)>
