Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 since it is the central node in a 3-star. 
Nodes connected to node 5: {0, 4, 6, 8, 9}
Now, for each of these nodes, we need to check if they are connected to exactly two other nodes among the rest. The pairs of nodes should form edges with the central node.
Let's go through each potential 3-star:
1. For node 0:
   Potential 3-star: <5, (0, 6, 1)>
2. For node 4:
   Potential 3-star: <5, (4, 9, 3)>
3. For node 6:
   Potential 3-star: <5, (6, 1, 0)>
4. For node 8:
   Potential 3-star: <5, (8, 3, 7)>
5. For node 9:
   Potential 3-star: <5, (9, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<5, (0, 6, 1)>, <5, (4, 9, 3)>, <5, (8, 3, 7)>
