Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify which nodes can serve as centers of 3-stars. Since a central node must be connected to exactly three other nodes, we can check each node in the graph to see if it has exactly three neighbors.

The nodes with three neighbors are:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 4, 7)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 2, 3)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 1, 2, 5)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 6, 7)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 4, 7, 8)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 4, 6)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 6, 7, 9)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 6, 7, 8)

Now, we can count the number of distinct 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (0, 2, 3)>
3. <3, (1, 2, 5)>
4. <4, (0, 6, 7)>
5. <6, (4, 7, 8)>
6. <7, (0, 4, 6)>
7. <8, (6, 7, 9)>
8. <9, (6, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
