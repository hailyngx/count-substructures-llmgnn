Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 2) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3 as they can be the centers of possible 3-stars. 
The nodes with degree 3 are: 4, 11, 12, 2, 6, 1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 3, 14.

Now, let's check for each identified potential center node how many 3-stars are present:

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 10, and 11.
- <4, (7, 10, 11)>
- <4, (7, 10, 12)>
- <4, (7, 11, 12)>

For node 11:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 6, 9, 12, and 1.
- <11, (4, 7, 12)>
- <11, (4, 7, 1)>
- <11, (4, 6, 7)>
- <11, (4, 6, 12)>

For node 12:
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 2, 5, 11.
- <12, (4, 7, 11)>
- <12, (4, 7, 5)>
- <12, (4, 2, 5)>
- <12, (4, 2, 11)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 12, 5, 0, 10, 3, 14.
- <2, (12, 5, 0)>
- <2, (12, 5, 14)>
- <2, (12, 3, 14)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 3, 11, 8.
- <6, (4, 5, 3)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 13, 11, 14, 10.
- <1, (7, 13, 11)>
- <1, (7, 14, 10)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 2, 14.
- <5, (6, 2, 14)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 12, 11, 13, 1.
- <7, (4, 11, 13)>
- <7, (4, 11, 1)>

For node 10:
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 13, 2, 1, 3.
- <10, (4, 13, 2)>

For node 13:
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 10.
- <13, (7, 1, 10)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 14, 10.
- <3, (6, 2, 14)>

For node 14:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 2, 1, 3.
- <14, (5, 1, 3)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars from the above combinations, we get a total of [13] 3-stars. 
<4, (7, 10, 11)>, <4, (7, 10, 12)>, <4, (7, 11, 12)>, <11, (4, 7, 12)>, <11, (4, 7, 1)>, <11, (4, 6, 7)>, <11, (4, 6, 12)>, <12, (4, 7, 11)>, <12, (4, 7, 5)>, <12, (4, 2, 5)>, <12, (4, 2, 11)>, <13, (7, 1, 10)>, <14, (5, 1, 3)>
