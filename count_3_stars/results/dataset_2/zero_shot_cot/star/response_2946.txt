Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 19) (6, 3) (6, 27) (9, 17) (9, 10) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 29) (18, 20) (18, 24) (26, 10) (26, 25) (26, 4) (15, 7) (15, 23) (16, 17) (16, 21) (16, 13) (16, 2) (11, 23) (11, 8) (23, 15) (23, 11) (23, 4) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 24) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 2) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 28) (3, 8) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 22) (28, 2) (21, 16) (21, 13) (21, 29) (25, 26) (25, 1) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 24) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 27) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 28) (2, 24) (13, 16) (13, 21) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 25) (20, 18) (27, 6) (27, 8) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 29) (29, 0) (29, 21) (29, 22) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 2) (24, 22) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph can be counted as follows:

First, we identify the nodes that have a degree of 4 (i.e., the center of potential 3-stars). From the given edges, the nodes with a degree of 4 are: 14, 17, 12, 0, 16, 23, 5, 19, 26, 3, 8, 4, 28, 21, 24.

Next, for each of the identified nodes, we check if they are connected to exactly three other nodes (leaves). If so, we count it as a 3-star.

Here is the list of unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (14, 12, 29)>
<12, (14, 7, 0)>
<16, (17, 21, 13)>
<23, (15, 11, 4)>
<5, (19, 1, 2)>
<19, (17, 5, 24)>
<26, (10, 25, 4)>
<3, (6, 5, 8)>
<8, (7, 11, 3)>
<4, (26, 23, 2)>
<28, (3, 8, 22)>
<21, (16, 13, 29)>
<24, (18, 19, 22)>

Therefore, there are [13] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
