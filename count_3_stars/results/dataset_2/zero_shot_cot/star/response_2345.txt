Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars present. 

Let's go through the steps:
1. Identify all nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 1, 2, 4, and 6 have 3 incident edges each.
2. For each of these nodes, check their connected nodes to form 3-stars:
- For Node 1: (1, 5, 3), (1, 5, 6)
- For Node 2: (2, 1, 9), (2, 1, 0)
- For Node 4: (4, 7, 8), (4, 7, 0)
- For Node 6: (6, 9, 1), (6, 9, 7)

So, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  <1, (5, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 9, 0)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>, <6, (9, 1, 7)>.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
