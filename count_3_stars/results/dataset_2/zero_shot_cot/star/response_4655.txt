Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 18) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 18) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 19) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 6) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (15, 17) (15, 14) (6, 12) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 2) (13, 11) (13, 7) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 8) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (2, 4, 7)>
2. <1, (8, 14, 19)>
3. <2, (0, 7, 17)>
4. <3, (5, 9, 18)>
5. <4, (0, 5, 19)>
6. <5, (3, 4, 17)>
7. <7, (0, 2, 18)>
8. <8, (1, 17, 18)>
9. <9, (3, 11, 12)>
10. <12, (6, 9, 16)>
11. <14, (1, 15, 16)>
12. <16, (12, 14, 19)>
13. <17, (2, 8, 15)>
14. <18, (3, 7, 8)>
15. <19, (4, 10, 14)>

Since each unique 3-star is listed only once, we have found 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
