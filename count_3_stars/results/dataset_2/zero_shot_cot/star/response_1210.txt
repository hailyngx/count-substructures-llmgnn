Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (27, 18) (27, 17) (27, 23) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 25) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 22) (28, 29) (28, 19) (28, 18) (29, 28) (29, 5) (26, 1) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 16) (17, 27) (17, 26) (17, 13) (5, 3) (5, 29) (5, 18) (5, 20) (13, 17) (13, 10) (7, 18) (11, 24) (11, 9) (11, 4) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 21) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 20) (12, 4) (12, 24) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 19) (25, 1) (25, 6) (25, 22) (19, 28) (19, 12) (22, 3) (22, 25) (22, 16) (8, 18) (24, 11) (24, 12) (20, 1) (20, 5) (20, 4) (15, 12) (15, 2) (14, 12) (14, 10) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (21, 26) (21, 23) (6, 3) (6, 25) (6, 10) (6, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 9) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph given the definition.

First, let's list the 3-stars we can find:
<1, (3, 26, 20)>
<3, (1, 5, 22)>
<5, (3, 29, 20)>
<10, (1, 13, 14)>
<11, (9, 24, 4)>
<12, (4, 24, 14)>
<16, (26, 22, 9)>
<18, (27, 28, 5)>
<20, (1, 5, 4)>
<22, (3, 25, 16)>
<24, (11, 12, 14)>
<26, (1, 17, 16)>
<29, (5, 28, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
