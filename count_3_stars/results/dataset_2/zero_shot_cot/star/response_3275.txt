Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 1, 3, 7, and 8. This forms the 3-stars: <5, (9, 6, 1)>, <5, (9, 3, 7)>, <5, (9, 8, 6)>, <5, (6, 1, 3)>, <5, (6, 3, 1)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, and <5, (7, 4, 8)>.

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found 4 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
