Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 19) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 24) (22, 12) (22, 25) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 6) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 16) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (9, 18) (26, 11) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 7) (0, 15) (0, 4) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 1) (23, 8) (23, 24) (28, 18) (29, 17) (29, 16) (29, 24) (29, 21) (17, 29) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 21) (4, 22) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 17) (6, 15) (6, 1) (21, 3) (21, 29) (21, 17) (21, 11) (7, 25) (7, 2) (7, 1) (5, 3) (5, 17) (19, 13) (19, 18) (14, 27) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 16) (18, 13) (18, 9) (18, 28) (18, 19) (10, 3) (10, 2) (16, 27) (16, 29) (16, 1) (16, 24) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 29) (24, 16) (11, 26) (11, 21) (11, 1) (11, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (12, 22) (12, 20) (12, 11) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (15, 4, 6)>
<1, (8, 7, 6)>
<2, (7, 10, 12)>
<3, (15, 8, 10)>
<4, (22, 27, 17)>
<5, (3, 17, 29)>
<6, (15, 1, 7)>
<7, (2, 12, 1)>
<8, (1, 3, 27)>
<9, (18, 28, 19)>
<11, (26, 21, 12)>
<13, (19, 18, 22)>
<14, (27, 16, 4)>
<15, (0, 6, 27)>
<16, (29, 24, 1)>
<17, (4, 5, 21)>
<18, (9, 19, 28)>
<19, (13, 18, 9)>
<20, (12, 25, 22)>
<21, (3, 11, 29)>
<22, (4, 25, 12)>
<24, (16, 29, 22)>
<25, (20, 7, 12)>
<26, (11, 21, 12)>
<27, (15, 4, 14)>
<28, (18, 9, 19)>
<29, (17, 21, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].
