Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. From the given edges, identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes that have three connections:
- Node 1
- Node 3
- Node 6
- Node 9
- Node 10
- Node 13

2. For each of these nodes, check if they form a 3-star with their connected nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (2, 3, 13)>
<3, (0, 1, 13)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 13)>
<10, (0, 2, 14)>
<13, (1, 3, 9)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
