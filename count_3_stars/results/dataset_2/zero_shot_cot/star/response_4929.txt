Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 15) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 12) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 11) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 15) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 14) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 10) (0, 6) (0, 12) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 16) (17, 9) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 19) 

Response:
First, let's list all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 0
- Node 2
- Node 7
- Node 8
- Node 10
- Node 11
- Node 12
- Node 15
- Node 17

Next, we will identify the 3-stars involving these nodes:

<0, (6, 12, 13)>
<2, (12, 14, 18)>
<7, (3, 12, 16)>
<8, (4, 13, 16)>
<10, (5, 6, 19)>
<11, (4, 6, 18)>
<12, (0, 2, 7)>
<15, (1, 13, 14)>
<17, (9, 14, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
