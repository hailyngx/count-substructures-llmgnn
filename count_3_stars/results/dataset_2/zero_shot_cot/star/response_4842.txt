Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 27) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 10) (18, 4) (18, 25) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 12) (11, 4) (11, 26) (11, 9) (11, 25) (14, 29) (14, 15) (14, 21) (15, 13) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 24) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 25) (19, 21) (16, 6) (24, 15) (24, 0) (24, 27) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 23) (0, 26) (0, 24) (0, 6) (5, 29) (5, 20) (12, 3) (27, 28) (27, 24) (27, 1) (20, 3) (20, 5) (20, 9) (20, 23) (6, 16) (6, 0) (25, 18) (25, 11) (25, 19) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 20) (23, 17) (23, 20) (23, 21) (1, 8) (1, 27) (1, 10) (1, 22) (10, 29) (10, 1) (21, 14) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 22) (22, 1) (22, 21) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star. 

Here are the nodes that satisfy the 3-star criteria:
- Node 4: (7, 18, 2)
- Node 7: (4, 19, 9)
- Node 8: (13, 2, 1)
- Node 13: (8, 2, 15)
- Node 28: (29, 26, 27)
- Node 29: (28, 5, 14)
- Node 2: (4, 8, 13)
- Node 26: (11, 28, 0)
- Node 11: (4, 26, 9)
- Node 15: (13, 14, 19)
- Node 19: (7, 15, 25)
- Node 24: (15, 0, 27)
- Node 0: (26, 24, 6)
- Node 5: (29, 20)
- Node 12: (3)
- Node 27: (28, 24, 1)
- Node 20: (3, 5, 9)
- Node 25: (18, 11, 19)
- Node 9: (7, 11, 17, 20)
- Node 23: (17, 20, 21)
- Node 1: (8, 27, 10, 22)
- Node 10: (29, 1)
- Node 21: (14, 19, 23, 22)
- Node 22: (1, 21)

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. 

[<4, (7, 18, 2)>, <7, (4, 19, 9)>, <13, (8, 2, 15)>, <28, (29, 26, 27)>, <29, (28, 5, 14)>, <15, (13, 14, 19)>, <19, (7, 15, 25)>, <24, (15, 0, 27)>, <26, (11, 28, 0)>, <0, (26, 24, 6)>, <20, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (8, 27, 10, 22)>, <21, (14, 19, 23, 22)>]

[13 unique 3-stars]
