Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 6) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 1) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 1) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (1, 11, 13)>
<1, (0, 4, 10)>
<2, (4, 7, 14)>
<3, (8, 11, 14)>
<4, (1, 2, 10)>
<5, (11, 12, 14)>
<6, (11, 13, 14)>
<7, (2, 4, 12)>
<8, (3, 9, 13)>
<9, (0, 8, 10)>
<10, (1, 4, 9)>
<11, (0, 3, 5)>
<12, (1, 3, 5)>
<13, (0, 6, 8)>
<14, (2, 3, 5)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [14] 3-stars.
