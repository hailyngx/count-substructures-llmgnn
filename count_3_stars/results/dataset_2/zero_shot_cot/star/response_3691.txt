Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's analyze each node to see which ones can act as the center of a 3-star:

- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 0) -> <4, (7, 9, 0)>
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (7, 2), (7, 5) -> <7, (4, 3, 6)>
- Node 6: (6, 7), (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 0) -> <6, (7, 5, 3)>
- Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 3) -> <9, (4, 3)>
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 0) -> <1, (3, 2, 5)>
- Node 3: (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8) -> <3, (7, 6, 9)>
- Node 5: (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 1), (5, 8) -> <5, (7, 6, 1)>
- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 0) -> <8, (3, 5, 0)>
- Node 2: (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 0) -> <2, (7, 1, 3)>
- Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 1), (0, 8), (0, 2) -> <0, (4, 6, 1)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, and the final answer is [9].
