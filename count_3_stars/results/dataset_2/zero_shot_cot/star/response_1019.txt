Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 19) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (6, 8) (6, 14) (16, 3) (16, 7) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 9) (12, 11) (12, 10) (10, 4) (10, 12) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 18)>
<4, (5, 9, 14)>
<7, (16, 11, 18)>
<9, (15, 4, 17)>
