Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 0) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (19, 16) (19, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (17, 18) (17, 9) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 4) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 15) (9, 17) (10, 5) (10, 6) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star.

1. Node 0: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 11, and 18.
2. Node 2: Connected to nodes 8, 14, and 18.
3. Node 4: Connected to nodes 1, 13, 14, and 15.
4. Node 6: Connected to nodes 10, 11, 14, and 16.
5. Node 8: Connected to nodes 2, 14, and 19.
6. Node 10: Connected to nodes 5, 6.
7. Node 12: Connected to nodes 13 and 15.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph.

[<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (8, 14, 18)>, <4, (1, 13, 14)>, <6, (10, 11, 14)>, <8, (2, 14, 19)>, <10, (5, 6)>, <12, (13, 15)>]

There are a total of [7] 3-stars in the graph.
