Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected in a way that forms a 3-star pattern.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 0)>
<5, (7, 8, 6)>
<6, (4, 8, 5)>
<0, (7, 8, 3)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 0, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 0)>
<9, (7, 1, 3)>

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have found a total of [10] 3-stars.
