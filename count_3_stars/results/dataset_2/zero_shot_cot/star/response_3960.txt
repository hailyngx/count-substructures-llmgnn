Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<5, (9, 3, 10)>
<9, (5, 6, 14)>
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<10, (5, 11, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 0)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<14, (9, 6, 12)>
<13, (9, 2, 4)>
<7, (3, 10, 0)>
<4, (6, 1, 13)>
<12, (5, 11, 14)>
<8, (1, 6, 0)>
<2, (6, 13, 4)>

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
