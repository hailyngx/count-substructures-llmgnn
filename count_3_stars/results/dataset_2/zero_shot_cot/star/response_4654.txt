Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique instances of 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (8, 5, 0)>
<4, (1, 11, 13)>
<5, (10, 8, 13)>
<6, (3, 12, 14)>
<7, (10, 12, 14)>
<9, (1, 11, 14)>
<11, (9, 4, 13)>
<12, (3, 10, 8)>
<14, (9, 4, 13)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
