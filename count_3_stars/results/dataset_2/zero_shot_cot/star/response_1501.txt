Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 1) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (1, 12) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 6) (2, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 4: <4, (8, 9, 11)>
- From node 8: <8, (4, 9, 10)>
- From node 7: <7, (8, 12, 0)>
- From node 12: <12, (7, 14, 1)>
- From node 5: <5, (7, 13, 0)>
- From node 13: <13, (5, 6, -)>
- From node 0: <0, (7, 5, 3)>
- From node 9: <9, (4, 8, 11)>
- From node 1: <1, (12, 6, -)>
- From node 6: <6, (8, 13, 1)>
- From node 2: <2, (6, 14, -)>
- From node 11: <11, (4, 7, 0)>
- From node 14: <14, (12, 5, 2)>
- From node 3: <3, (7, 5, 0)>
- From node 10: <10, (8, 9, 6)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
