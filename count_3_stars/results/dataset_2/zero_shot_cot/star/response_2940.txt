Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes which are directly connected to node 5 (since we are looking for 3-stars centered at node 5). 
Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 7. 

Next, let's check if each of these possible 3-stars is indeed a 3-star.

1. For node 0:
   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5, but not to node 3.
   - So, <0, (1, 5)> is not a 3-star.

2. For node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
   - So, <3, (1, 5, 7)> is a 3-star.

3. For node 7:
   - Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
   - So, <7, (4, 5, 6)> is a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars are <3, (1, 5, 7)> and <7, (4, 5, 6)>.
