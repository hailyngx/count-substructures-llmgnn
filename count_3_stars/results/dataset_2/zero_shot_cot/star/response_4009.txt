Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 12) (15, 11) (5, 2) (5, 17) (9, 3) (9, 16) (9, 13) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 10) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 8) (8, 1) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 8) (0, 16) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 4) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (11, 15) (11, 4) (11, 19) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 18) (18, 1) (18, 10) (18, 17) (17, 5) (17, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars.

Let's list all the 3-stars first:

<3, (15, 9, 12)>
<15, (3, 1, 11)>
<5, (2, 17, 16)>
<9, (3, 16, 13)>
<4, (3, 12, 11)>
<7, (6, 10, 13)>
<13, (9, 7, 10)>
<1, (15, 18, 8)>
<8, (1, 19, 0)>
<19, (8, 11, 2)>
<0, (8, 16, 2)>
<16, (9, 0, 2)>
<12, (3, 15, 4)>
<2, (5, 16, 6)>
<11, (15, 4, 19)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<10, (7, 13, 2)>
<18, (1, 17, 10)>
<17, (5, 18, 17)>

Count of 3-stars: [18]
