Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 2) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 14) (23, 11) (23, 24) (17, 29) (17, 27) (17, 2) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 18) (28, 21) (28, 13) (28, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 0) (11, 5) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 15) (14, 21) (14, 26) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 4) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 27) (18, 29) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 6) (4, 9) (4, 26) (4, 22) (4, 3) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 3) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 5) (24, 23) (24, 11) (24, 12) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 20) (6, 19) (6, 27) (27, 17) (27, 16) (27, 6) (12, 21) (12, 24) (12, 1) (20, 5) (20, 3) (15, 13) (15, 25) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 2) (25, 15) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 22) (3, 20) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have exactly three neighbors, which indicates the potential central nodes for 3-stars.
From the given information, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are: 7, 21, 29, 6, 12, and 16.
We will now check the connections of these potential central nodes to determine the 3-stars.

For node 7:
- 7 is connected to 5 nodes: 21, 16, 29, 2, 26
<7, (21, 16, 29)>
This is a 3-star.

For node 21:
- 21 is connected to 4 nodes: 7, 28, 12, 14
<21, (7, 28, 12)>
This is a 3-star.
- 21 is connected to 2 nodes that were not already considered.

For node 29:
- 29 is connected to 4 nodes: 7, 17, 25, 18
<29, (7, 17, 25)>
This is a 3-star.

For node 6:
- 6 is connected to 3 nodes: 19, 27, 19
<6, (19, 27, 19)>
This is a 3-star.

For node 12:
- 12 is connected to 3 nodes: 21, 24, 1
<12, (21, 24, 1)>
This is a 3-star.

For node 16:
- 16 is connected to 3 nodes: 7, 0, 27
<16, (7, 0, 27)>
This is a 3-star.

Total 3-stars: 4
