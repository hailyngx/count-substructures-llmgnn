Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 8) (15, 13) (5, 3) (5, 21) (6, 3) (6, 20) (6, 27) (8, 15) (8, 23) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 29) (23, 24) (12, 27) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 21) (27, 6) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 0) (26, 29) (26, 21) (4, 18) (4, 25) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 11) (18, 16) (21, 5) (21, 12) (21, 26) (21, 0) (28, 2) (17, 13) (17, 7) (20, 6) (20, 12) (20, 14) (7, 17) (25, 4) (25, 19) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 24) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 19) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 0) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 29) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 20) (14, 11) (19, 1) (19, 25) (19, 0) (19, 10) (2, 28) (29, 23) (29, 26) (29, 4) (29, 11) (22, 8) (22, 27) (22, 0) (24, 3) (24, 23) (24, 13) (24, 10) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 3:
   <3, (24, 10, 6)>
   <3, (24, 10, 5)>
   <3, (24, 10, 6)>
   <3, (10, 24, 6)>

2. Node 5:
   <5, (3, 21, 21)>
   <5, (3, 21, 21)>

3. Node 6:
   <6, (3, 20, 27)>
   <6, (3, 20, 27)>
   <6, (27, 20, 12)>

4. Node 10:
   <10, (3, 24, 5)>
   <10, (3, 24, 6)>
   <10, (1, 19, 24)>
   
5. Node 12:
   <12, (27, 20, 21)>
   <12, (27, 20, 14)>
   
6. Node 13:
   <13, (15, 17, 11)>
   <13, (17, 15, 11)>
   
7. Node 14:
   <14, (27, 18, 20)>
   <14, (27, 18, 11)>
   
8. Node 16:
   <16, (12, 18, 0)>
   
9. Node 18:
   <18, (4, 16, 14)>
   
10. Node 19:
   <19, (1, 25, 0)>
   
11. Node 20:
   <20, (6, 12, 14)>
   
12. Node 21:
   <21, (5, 12, 0)>
   
13. Node 22:
   <22, (8, 27, 0)>
   
14. Node 23:
   <23, (8, 29, 24)>
   
15. Node 24:
   <24, (3, 23, 13)>
   
16. Node 27:
   <27, (6, 22, 14)>
   
17. Node 29:
   <29, (4, 26, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
