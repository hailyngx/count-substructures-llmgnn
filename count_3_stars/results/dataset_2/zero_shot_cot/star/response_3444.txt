Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the number of 3-stars it contains.

First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 6 since node 6 will be the central node of any 3-star involving it. 
Nodes directly connected to node 6: 9, 5, 7, 2

Next, let's find the 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
<6, (9, 7, 2)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<6, (7, 9, 5)>
<6, (2, 9, 5)>

Now let's find the 3-stars involving other center nodes:
Considering node 9:
<9, (6, 4, 7)>
<9, (7, 8, 4)>

Considering node 5:
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<5, (7, 8, 6)>

Considering node 7:
<7, (6, 4, 5)>
<7, (5, 8, 6)>

Considering node 2:
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (8, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
<6, (9, 7, 2)>, <6, (5, 7, 2)>, <6, (7, 9, 5)>, <6, (2, 9, 5)>, <9, (6, 4, 7)>, <9, (7, 8, 4)>, <5, (6, 1, 7)>, <5, (7, 8, 6)>
