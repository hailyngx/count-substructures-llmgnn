Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 12) (16, 0) (16, 5) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 23) (6, 27) (9, 29) (4, 24) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 12) (5, 16) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 21) (26, 8) (26, 25) (26, 17) (26, 27) (28, 0) (28, 15) (17, 26) (17, 20) (17, 18) (20, 17) (20, 21) (20, 2) (27, 6) (27, 26) (27, 25) (27, 21) (1, 5) (1, 29) (1, 10) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 0) (29, 18) (19, 6) (19, 18) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 12) (18, 17) (18, 29) (18, 19) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 29) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 23) (3, 22) (7, 22) (2, 20) (2, 0) (2, 15) (14, 8) (14, 23) (21, 8) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 27) (13, 11) (13, 25) (13, 3) (15, 28) (15, 2) (24, 4) (24, 12) (24, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 25) (12, 24) (12, 22) (10, 1) (10, 24) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 12) (23, 6) (23, 3) (23, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars in the graph.

Nodes connected to 3 other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 16, 28, and 29.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 15, and 20.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 13, and 23.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 21.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 12, 14, and 26.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 22, and 25.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 25.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 28, and 0.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 17, 19, and 29.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 2, 17, and 21.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 27.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 12.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 12.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 12, 13, and 26.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 8, 17, and 27.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 6, 21, and 25.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 18.

From the list above, we see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 13, 15, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, and 27 are potentially the centers of 3-stars in the graph.

Let's count the number of 3-stars with one of these nodes as the center. We will iterate through each of these nodes and list the corresponding 3-stars.

<0, (16, 28, 29)>
<2, (0, 15, 20)>
<3, (4, 13, 23)>
<5, (1, 6, 21)>
<8, (12, 14, 26)>
<12, (8, 22, 25)>
<13, (3, 11, 25)>
<15, (2, 0, 28)>
<20, (2, 17, 21)>
<21, (5, 8, 27)>
<22, (3, 7, 12)>
<24, (4, 10, 12)>
<25, (12, 13, 26)>
<27, (6, 21, 25)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
