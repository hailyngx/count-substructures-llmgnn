Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 14) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 17) (5, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 17) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 17) (14, 15) (14, 12) (14, 16) (18, 6) (18, 11) (18, 12) (19, 9) (19, 11) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 18) (12, 16) (16, 14) (16, 12) (16, 8) (11, 18) (11, 19) (11, 8) (8, 16) (8, 11) (2, 9) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph.
From the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars based on the definition given.
After identifying the 3-stars, we will count them to provide the final answer.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<3, (15, 6, 12)>
<15, (3, 7, 14)>
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<7, (15, 4, 0)>
<6, (3, 5, 1)>
<9, (4, 2, 19)>
<17, (4, 7, 10)>
<0, (7, 17, 0)>
<14, (15, 12, 16)>
<18, (6, 11, 12)>
<19, (9, 11, 19)>
<1, (6, 13, 1)>
<12, (3, 15, 14)>
<16, (14, 12, 8)>
<11, (18, 19, 8)>
<8, (16, 11, 8)>
<2, (9, 13, 2)>
<13, (4, 6, 1)>

There are 18 unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
So the final answer is [18].
