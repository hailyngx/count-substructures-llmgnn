Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5 since it will be the center of the 3-star graphs. 
The nodes connected to node 5 are: 1, 3, 7, 8.
Now we can see which combinations of these nodes form valid 3-star graphs. 

The 3-star graphs in this graph are:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
So, there are 4 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
