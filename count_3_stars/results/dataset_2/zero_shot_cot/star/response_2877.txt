Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, and 3. So, <4, (0, 1, 6)> is a 3-star.
2. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 6, 8, and 5. So, <7, (0, 6, 8)> is a 3-star.
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 9, and 1. So, <6, (4, 7, 9)> is a 3-star.
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 2, and 3. So, <9, (6, 8, 2)> is a 3-star.
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 0, and it forms a 3-star as <5, (7, 8, 0)>.
6. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 1, and 3. So, <2, (6, 9, 1)> is a 3-star.
7. Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 5, and 3. So, <8, (7, 9, 5)> and <8, (9, 5, 7)> are two 3-stars.
8. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 5, and it forms a 3-star as <0, (4, 7, 5)>.
9. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 2, and 8. So, <1, (4, 6, 2)> is a 3-star.
10. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 2, and 8. So, <3, (4, 9, 2)> and <3, (9, 2, 4)> are two 3-stars.

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
