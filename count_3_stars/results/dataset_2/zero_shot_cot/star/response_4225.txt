Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 4) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (7, 13, 4)>
<2, (9, 5, 1)>
<3, (14, 2, 4)>
<4, (6, 3, 1)>
<5, (2, 13, 0)>
<7, (1, 14, 8)>
<8, (7, 1, 10)>
<9, (2, 13, 7)>
<10, (13, 14, 8)>
<11, (12, 4, 3)>
<12, (7, 14, 11)>
<13, (6, 9, 5)>
<14, (7, 12, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
