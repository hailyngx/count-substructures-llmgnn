Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 22) (15, 28) (15, 2) (1, 21) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 9) (21, 29) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 26) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 2) (20, 16) (25, 27) (25, 6) (6, 25) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 21) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 24) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 13) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 24) (8, 22) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 23) (11, 28) (11, 14) (17, 20) (17, 0) (17, 13) (13, 28) (13, 17) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 20) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 4) (27, 25) (27, 10) (16, 7) (16, 20) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 23) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 23) (5, 0) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 23) (24, 29) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 22) (23, 14) (23, 19) (23, 12) (23, 24) (22, 15) (22, 8) (22, 29) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would form the leaves of a 3-star. Then we can count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph.

The nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 26, 27, and 28.

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<2, (8, 20, 9)>
<6, (14, 9, 24)>
<7, (16, 26, 21)>
<8, (22, 2, 24)>
<9, (6, 2, 21)>
<10, (27, 4, 18)>
<11, (14, 13, 28)>
<12, (4, 1, 23)>
<15, (28, 2, 22)>
<16, (20, 7, 26)>
<18, (19, 10, 3)>
<19, (23, 4, 18)>
<20, (17, 2, 26)>
<21, (29, 7, 1)>
<23, (24, 19, 12)>
<24, (29, 8, 9)>
<26, (20, 7, 3)>
<27, (25, 10, 27)>
<28, (11, 13, 15)>

There are a total of [18] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
