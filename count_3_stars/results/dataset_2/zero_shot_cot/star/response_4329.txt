Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 9) 

Response:
First, we will identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which is a characteristic of a 3-star. Since there are 15 nodes in total, let's look for nodes that are connected to three other nodes.

- Node 1 is connected to 5, 6, 11 (3 connections)
- Node 2 is connected to 1, 5, 9 (3 connections)
- Node 3 is connected to 1, 5, 9 (3 connections)
- Node 4 is connected to 0, 7, 9 (3 connections)
- Node 5 is connected to 1, 2, 14 (3 connections)
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 6, 11 (3 connections)
- Node 12 is connected to 0, 9, 11 (3 connections)
- Node 13 is connected to 2, 10, 12 (3 connections)

Now, we will form the 3-stars using this information. We will list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (5, 6, 11)>
<2, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (5, 1, 14)>
<8, (0, 6, 11)>
<12, (0, 9, 11)>
<13, (2, 10, 12)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
