Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
The steps to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: Based on the given edges, identify all nodes that have exactly 3 connections or 3 edges. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly 3 connections: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10

Step 2: For each node identified in Step 1, determine the 3-stars around it. 

For Node 1:
The 3-stars with center Node 1 and 3 leaves: 
<1, (2, 9, 10)>
<1, (0, 9, 10)>

For Node 4:
There are no 3-stars around Node 4 since it does not connect to any other nodes in the graph.

For Node 5:
The 3-stars with center Node 5 and 3 leaves:
<5, (0, 11, 12)>
<5, (0, 12, 14)>

For Node 7:
There are no 3-stars around Node 7 since it does not connect to exactly 3 nodes.

For Node 8:
There are no 3-stars around Node 8 since it does not connect to exactly 3 nodes.

For Node 9:
There are no 3-stars around Node 9 since it does not connect to exactly 3 nodes.

For Node 10:
There are no 3-stars around Node 10 since it does not connect to exactly 3 nodes.

Step 3: Count all the unique 3-stars identified in Step 2.

Total number of unique 3-stars: 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

<1, (2, 9, 10)>, <1, (0, 9, 10)>, <5, (0, 11, 12)>, <5, (0, 12, 14)>
