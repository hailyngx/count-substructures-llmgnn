Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) 

Response:
There are 3-star configurations in this graph. Let's find them step by step:

1. Starting from node 1:
    - <1, (3, 4, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 8)>

2. Moving on to node 3:
    - <3, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <3, (1, 2, 5)>
    
3. Exploring node 4:
    - <4, (1, 8, 9)>

4. Examining node 8:
    - <8, (1, 3, 4)>
    - <8, (1, 5, 9)>

5. Moving to node 5:
    - <5, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <5, (0, 3, 8)>

6. Moving to node 0:
    - <0, (4, 5, 7)>
    
7. Finally, at node 9:
    - <9, (4, 8, 2)>

Therefore, there are 10 different 3-stars in this graph. 
So, the final answer is [10].
