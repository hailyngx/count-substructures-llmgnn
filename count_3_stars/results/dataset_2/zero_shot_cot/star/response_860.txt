Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 3) (1, 6) (1, 18) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 12) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 19) (2, 3) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 19) (17, 18) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (10, 16) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 10) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by considering each node as the potential center of a 3-star and counting the number of 3-stars around it. 

Let's examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

1. Node 0: (0, 11, 12), (0, 5, 8) [<0, (11, 12, 5)>]
2. Node 1: (1, 6, 18) [<1, (6, 18, 8)>]
3. Node 2: (2, 3, 15) 
4. Node 3: (3, 15, 9) [<3, (15, 9, 7)>]
5. Node 4: (4, 6, 10) [<4, (6, 10, 19)>]
6. Node 5: (5, 0, 8)
7. Node 6: (6, 1, 4) [<6, (1, 4, 10)>]
8. Node 7: (7, 9, 12) [<7, (9, 12, 17)>]
9. Node 8: (8, 5, 14)
10. Node 9: (9, 3, 7)
11. Node 10: (10, 4, 16) 
12. Node 11: (11, 0, 3) 
13. Node 12: (12, 0, 7)
14. Node 13: (13, 8, 12)
15. Node 14: (14, 8, 16)
16. Node 15: (15, 3, 9)
17. Node 16: (16, 10, 14)
18. Node 17: (17, 7, 19) [<17, (7, 19, 18)>]
19. Node 18: (18, 1, 17)
20. Node 19: (19, 7, 17)

There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [6].
