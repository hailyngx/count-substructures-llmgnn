Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 29) (2, 29) (2, 15) (29, 22) (29, 2) (29, 17) (29, 18) (8, 13) (8, 23) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 17) (23, 8) (23, 20) (23, 12) (12, 23) (12, 27) (12, 10) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 9) (27, 1) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 11) (26, 1) (26, 10) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 3) (18, 29) (18, 4) (18, 11) (6, 15) (28, 16) (28, 24) (17, 29) (17, 8) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 21) (9, 22) (9, 27) (9, 17) (9, 3) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 5) (16, 8) (16, 28) (16, 10) (7, 27) (7, 3) (7, 14) (10, 12) (10, 26) (10, 16) (10, 25) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (20, 23) (20, 24) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 21) (0, 5) (0, 21) (21, 17) (21, 14) (21, 0) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 25) (24, 28) (24, 20) (25, 8) (25, 10) (25, 15) 

Response:
Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

[<1, (11, 13, 1)>, <2, (2, 17, 29)>, <3, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (4, 18, 22)>, <5, (0, 5, 19)>, <6, (6, 15, 25)>, <7, (7, 14, 27)>, <8, (8, 16, 17)>, <9, (9, 17, 27)>, <10, (10, 16, 26)>, <11, (1, 11, 13)>, <12, (12, 23, 27)>, <13, (11, 13, 1)>, <14, (7, 14, 21)>, <15, (6, 15, 25)>, <16, (8, 16, 28)>, <17, (2, 17, 29)>, <18, (4, 18, 29)>, <19, (0, 5, 19)>, <20, (20, 23, 24)>]

[<1, (11, 13, 1)>, <2, (2, 17, 29)>, <3, (3, 4, 9)>, <4, (4, 18, 22)>, <5, (0, 5, 19)>, <6, (6, 15, 25)>, <7, (7, 14, 27)>, <8, (8, 16, 17)>, <9, (9, 17, 27)>, <10, (10, 16, 26)>, <11, (1, 11, 13)>, <12, (12, 23, 27)>, <13, (11, 13, 1)>, <14, (7, 14, 21)>, <15, (6, 15, 25)>, <16, (8, 16, 28)>, <17, (2, 17, 29)>, <18, (4, 18, 29)>, <19, (0, 5, 19)>, <20, (20, 23, 24)>]

There are total [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
