Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph:

Node 0 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 7.
Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 3, 8.
Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 3, 5.
Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 1, 2, 5.
Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 5, 1, 3.
Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 3, 2.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 2, 4, 0.
Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 0, 5, 1.
Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 1.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 7, 0.

To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. Since a 3-star has 4 nodes (center + 3 leaves), we need to consider groups of 4 nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 9, 7)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <2, (6, 9, 3)>
- <3, (4, 1, 2)>
- <4, (6, 8, 5)>
- <5, (4, 7, 3)>
- <6, (7, 2, 4)>
- <7, (6, 9, 0)>
- <8, (4, 1, 8)>
- <9, (2, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
