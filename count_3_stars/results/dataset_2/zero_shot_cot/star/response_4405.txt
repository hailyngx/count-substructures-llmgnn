Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 8) (27, 14) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 6) (25, 23) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 10) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 29) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 21) (9, 25) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 28) (7, 17) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 21) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 13) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 20) (13, 9) (13, 18) (26, 10) (26, 29) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 1) (19, 15) (19, 10) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 1) (17, 15) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 7) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 19) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (21, 5) (21, 4) (21, 24) (24, 21) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 29) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (28, 20) (28, 7) (28, 14) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:

0: 20, 22, 8
1: 2, 11, 16
2: 1, 16, 14
3: 15, 25, 11, 18
4: 9, 18, 21
5: 9, 29, 11, 21
6: 25, 22, 29
7: 12, 16, 10, 28, 17
8: 0, 20
9: 25, 5, 4, 13
10: 22, 7, 26, 19
11: 3, 5, 1
12: 7
13: 9, 18
14: 27, 2, 28
15: 3, 19, 17
16: 7, 1, 2
17: 15, 25, 23, 7
18: 3, 4, 13
19: 15, 10
20: 0, 8
21: 5, 4, 24
22: 0, 6, 10
23: 25, 17, 29
24: 21
25: 3, 15, 9, 6, 23
26: 10, 29
27: 14
28: 20, 7, 14
29: 5, 6, 26

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars: 

- Node 3: (15, 11, 18) <3, (15, 11, 18)>
- Node 5: (9, 11, 21) <5, (9, 11, 21)>
- Node 7: (16, 10, 28) <7, (16, 10, 28)>
- Node 15: (19, 17, 3) <15, (19, 17, 3)>
- Node 17: (25, 23, 7) <17, (25, 23, 7)>
- Node 25: (15, 9, 6) <25, (15, 9, 6)>
- Node 29: (5, 6, 26) <29, (5, 6, 26)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
