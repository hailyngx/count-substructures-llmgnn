Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 23) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 23) (2, 9) (2, 22) (29, 28) (29, 6) (29, 3) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 20) (21, 8) (0, 21) (0, 22) (0, 25) (27, 25) (27, 14) (27, 5) (8, 7) (8, 21) (8, 3) (23, 9) (23, 26) (23, 19) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 5) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 13) (28, 15) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 26) (18, 4) (19, 26) (19, 23) (19, 24) (19, 13) (15, 28) (20, 21) (20, 24) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 19) (11, 6) (16, 9) (16, 10) (22, 2) (22, 0) (22, 5) (1, 4) (1, 25) (1, 5) (1, 24) (6, 29) (6, 11) (12, 28) (25, 0) (25, 27) (25, 1) (25, 14) (3, 29) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 24) (24, 19) (24, 20) (24, 1) (24, 3) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 25) (14, 5) (5, 27) (5, 17) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph, listed as follows:
<0, (21, 20, 24)>
<1, (4, 5, 25)>
<3, (7, 8, 10)>
<5, (1, 14, 22)>
<6, (11, 29, 28)>
<8, (7, 21, 3)>
<13, (19, 21, 28)>
<14, (5, 25, 27)>
<16, (9, 10, 26)>
<19, (13, 23, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
