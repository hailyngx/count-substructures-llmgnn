Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars it contains.

We have a total of 15 nodes in the graph. We will find the unique 3-stars by checking each node as a potential center of a 3-star and determining which other nodes are connected to it to form a 3-star.

Starting from node 0 to node 14 as potential centers:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: {14, 12, 1}.
  - Node 14 and 12 are not directly connected, so no 3-star here.
  - Node 0, 1, and 14 form a 3-star: <0, (1, 14)>.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {4, 7, 0, 2, 14}.
  - Node 1, 7, and 14 form a 3-star: <1, (7, 14)>.
  - Node 1, 2, and 4 form a 3-star: <1, (2, 4)>.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: {9, 3, 1, 12, 10}.
  - Node 2 and 9 are not directly connected, so no 3-star here.
  - Node 2, 1, and 3 form a 3-star: <2, (1, 3)>.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {9, 11, 13, 2, 5}.
  - Node 3, 9, and 13 form a 3-star: <3, (9, 13)>.
  - Node 3 and 11 are not directly connected, so no 3-star here.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: {8, 5, 1}.
  - Node 4, 1, and 5 form a 3-star: <4, (1, 5)>.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: {4, 8, 11, 13, 13}.
  - Node 5, 4, and 8 form a 3-star: <5, (4, 8)>.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {9, 11, 12, 8}.
  - Node 6 and 9 are not directly connected, so no 3-star here.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {14, 13}.
  - Node 7 and 14 are not directly connected, so no 3-star here.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: {6, 4, 5, 14}.
  - Node 8, 4, and 5 form a 3-star: <8, (4, 5)>.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: {6, 2, 3, 13, 12}.
  - Node 9 and 2 are not directly connected, so no 3-star here.
- Node 10 has 2 neighbors: {2, 12}.
  - Node 10 and 2 are not directly connected, so no 3-star here.
- Node 11 has 4 neighbors: {6, 13, 3, 5}.
  - Node 11, 3, and 13 form a 3-star: <11, (3, 13)>.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors: {6, 9, 0, 2, 10}.
  - Node 12, 6, and 9 form a 3-star: <12, (6, 9)>.
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors: {9, 7, 3, 11, 5}.
  - Node 13, 3, and 9 form a 3-star: <13, (3, 9)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 14)>, <1, (7, 14)>, <1, (2, 4)>, <2, (1, 3)>, <3, (9, 13)>, <4, (1, 5)>, <5, (4, 8)>, <8, (4, 5)>, <11, (3, 13)>, <12, (6, 9)>, <13, (3, 9)>.

Counting all the 3-stars listed above, we find that there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
