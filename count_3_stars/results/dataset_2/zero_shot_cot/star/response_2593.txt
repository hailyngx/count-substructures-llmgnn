Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 16) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (6, 14) (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 12) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 7) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 4) (8, 14) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 0) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 10) (11, 19) (11, 4) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes with degree 3 since they can potentially form 3-stars. The nodes with degree 3 are: 3, 15, 14, 2, 18, 1, 6, 9, 12, 7, 4, and 13.

Next, we will look at each of these nodes and their neighbors to identify 3-stars. 

From node 3:
- <3, (15, 17, 13)>
- <3, (15, 17, 12)>
- <3, (15, 17, 1)>
- <3, (15, 2, 12)>
- <3, (15, 2, 13)>

From node 15:
- <15, (3, 7, 2)>
- <15, (3, 7, 16)>

From node 14:
- No 3-stars found.

From node 2:
- <2, (15, 18, 12)>
- <2, (15, 18, 4)>

From node 18:
- <18, (2, 19, 0)>
- <18, (2, 19, 7)>

From node 1:
- No 3-stars found.

From node 6:
- No 3-stars found.

From node 9:
- No 3-stars found.

From node 12:
- No 3-stars found.

From node 7:
- No 3-stars found.

From node 4:
- No 3-stars found.

From node 13:
- No 3-stars found.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9] as follows:
<3, (15, 17, 13)>, <3, (15, 17, 12)>, <3, (15, 17, 1)>, <3, (15, 2, 12)>, <3, (15, 2, 13)>, <15, (3, 7, 2)>, <15, (3, 7, 16)>, <2, (15, 18, 12)>, <2, (15, 18, 4)>
