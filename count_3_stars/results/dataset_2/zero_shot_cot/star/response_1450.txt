Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 0) (26, 17) (5, 9) (5, 19) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 24) (18, 12) (22, 15) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 25) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 25) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 25) (11, 8) (11, 24) (11, 7) (11, 17) (0, 26) (0, 21) (0, 12) (20, 27) (28, 29) (28, 6) (29, 28) (29, 4) (2, 12) (2, 27) (6, 10) (6, 28) (6, 7) (4, 29) (4, 27) (27, 20) (27, 2) (27, 4) (27, 1) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 14) (19, 23) (1, 27) (1, 16) (1, 24) (12, 18) (12, 22) (12, 0) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 1) (16, 7) (16, 14) (24, 18) (24, 11) (24, 1) (3, 8) (17, 26) (17, 11) (17, 23) (23, 18) (23, 19) (23, 17) (23, 14) (23, 25) (21, 26) (21, 0) (21, 19) (15, 9) (15, 22) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 23) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 23) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (26, 18, 12)>
<1, (27, 16, 24)>
<2, (12, 27, 2)>
<3, (8, 13, 25)>
<4, (29, 27, 4)>
<5, (9, 19, 5)>
<6, (10, 28, 7)>
<7, (11, 6, 16)>
<8, (13, 3, 25)>
<9, (5, 15, 9)>
<10, (25, 6, 16)>
<11, (8, 17, 24)>
<12, (18, 0, 2)>
<13, (9, 8, 25)>
<14, (19, 16, 23)>
<15, (9, 22, 15)>
<16, (1, 7, 14)>
<17, (26, 11, 23)>
<18, (26, 24, 12)>
<19, (23, 21, 14)>
<20, (27, 2, 1)>
<21, (0, 19, 26)>
<22, (15, 12, 0)>
<23, (25, 23, 17)>
<24, (11, 1, 18)>
<25, (8, 13, 23)>
<26, (0, 17, 21)>
<27, (4, 1, 20)>
<28, (29, 6, 10)>
<29, (28, 4, 6)>

Thus, there are 30 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [30].
