Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 11) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 18) (8, 3) (8, 14) (13, 11) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 3) (16, 0) (16, 17) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 15) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 11) (17, 16) (17, 7) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 4) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 19) (7, 18) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 7) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars.

From the provided edges, we can identify the nodes with exactly three incident edges:
- Node 9 has edges (5, 9), (6, 9), and (15, 9)
- Node 6 has edges (5, 6), (9, 6), and (10, 6)
- Node 15 has edges (9, 15), (2, 15), and (18, 15)
- Node 0 has edges (1, 0), (16, 0), and (12, 0)
- Node 16 has edges (3, 16), (0, 16), and (17, 16)
- Node 12 has edges (0, 12), (2, 12), and (14, 12)
- Node 7 has edges (17, 7), (10, 7), and (19, 7)
- Node 3 has edges (16, 3), (19, 3), and (8, 3)

Now, we will count the number of 3-stars:

1. For the 3-star centered at node 9:
  - Leaves: 5, 6, 15
  - <9, (5, 6, 15)>

2. For the 3-star centered at node 6:
  - Leaves: 5, 9, 10
  - <6, (5, 9, 10)>

3. For the 3-star centered at node 15:
  - Leaves: 9, 2, 18
  - <15, (9, 2, 18)>

4. For the 3-star centered at node 0:
  - Leaves: 1, 16, 12
  - <0, (1, 16, 12)>

5. For the 3-star centered at node 16:
  - Leaves: 3, 0, 17
  - <16, (3, 0, 17)>

6. For the 3-star centered at node 12:
  - Leaves: 0, 2, 14
  - <12, (0, 2, 14)>

7. For the 3-star centered at node 7:
  - Leaves: 17, 10, 19
  - <7, (17, 10, 19)>

8. For the 3-star centered at node 3:
  - Leaves: 16, 19, 8
  - <3, (16, 19, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is therefore [8].
