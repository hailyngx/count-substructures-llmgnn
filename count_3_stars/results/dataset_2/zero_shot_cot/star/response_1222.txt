Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 25) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 1) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 29) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 7) (20, 23) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 29) (4, 18) (17, 20) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 24) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 17) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 25) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 9) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 20) (23, 20) (23, 2) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 9) (21, 26) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 14) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 21) (14, 1) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 11) (24, 22) (24, 17) (24, 2) (12, 18) (12, 21) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 12) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 10) (1, 22) (1, 14) (2, 3) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (7, 20, 29)>
<2, (3, 23, 24)>
<5, (3, 6, 19)>
<11, (3, 25, 28)>
<12, (18, 16, 21)>
<14, (1, 5, 26)>
<15, (3, 19, 25)>
<16, (3, 12, 18)>
<17, (20, 24, 25)>
<18, (4, 12, 22)>
<19, (5, 9, 15)>
<20, (0, 17, 23)>
<21, (10, 12, 26)>
<22, (1, 18, 24)>
<26, (14, 15, 21)>
<29, (0, 6, 17)>

So, there are 16 unique 3-stars found in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
