Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. Let's determine the 3-stars one by one:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 4: <5, (9, 6, 4)>
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 4: <9, (5, 6, 4)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 8: <4, (5, 9, 8)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 1: <7, (5, 2, 1)>
5. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7: <1, (9, 4, 7)>
6. Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 6: <3, (9, 1, 6)>
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3: <6, (5, 9, 3)>
8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 2: <8, (4, 3, 2)>
9. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 6: <2, (4, 7, 6)>
10. Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 0: <0, (9, 6, 0)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the final answer is [10].
