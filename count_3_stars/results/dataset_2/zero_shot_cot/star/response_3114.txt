Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 7) (17, 9) (17, 14) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 6) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 4) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 15) (6, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<3, (1, 7, 10)>
<4, (1, 11, 19)>
<5, (2, 8, 13)>
<6, (12, 15, 18)>
<7, (1, 3, 14)>
<8, (2, 9, 18)>
<9, (5, 14, 17)>
<10, (3, 12, 16)>
<12, (6, 10, 15)>
<13, (5, 8, 18)>
<14, (7, 9, 17)>
<15, (6, 12, 16)>
<16, (10, 15, 19)>
<18, (6, 8, 13)>
<19, (4, 9, 16)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph: [16]
