Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will follow these steps:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges adjacent to them. These nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars.

2. For each identified center node, check if the adjacent nodes of the center are connected to each other. If they are, then form a 3-star.

Let's go ahead and find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

Potential center nodes with 3 adjacent edges:
- Node 6
- Node 9
- Node 1
- Node 4
- Node 0
- Node 7
- Node 3
- Node 5

3-stars in the graph:
<6, (1, 7, 4)>
<9, (1, 7, 4)>
<1, (6, 9, 7)>
<4, (6, 9, 5)>
<0, (6, 7, 5)>
<7, (6, 9, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
