Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can identify the following 3-stars:
- Center: 5, Leaves: 9, 8, 7
- Center: 9, Leaves: 5, 4, 2
- Center: 1, Leaves: 9, 3, 4
- Center: 3, Leaves: 1, 6, 2
- Center: 6, Leaves: 3, 7, 8
- Center: 2, Leaves: 9, 3, 8
- Center: 8, Leaves: 5, 1, 3
- Center: 0, Leaves: 6, 8
- Center: 7, Leaves: 5, 6, 2
- Center: 4, Leaves: 9, 1, 3

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
