Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 8) (14, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will form the central node of a 3-star. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes are: 4, 6, 7, 5, 10, 3, and 14.

2. For node 4: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 5) - Forming the 3-star <4, (7, 8, 13)>.
   
3. For node 6: (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) - Forming the 3-star <6, (7, 5, 14)>.
   
4. For node 7: (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) - Forming the 3-star <7, (4, 11, 6)>.
   
5. For node 5: (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) - Forming the 3-star <5, (4, 6, 0)>.
   
6. For node 10: (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) - Forming the 3-star <10, (11, 8, 2)>.
   
7. For node 3: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) - Forming the 3-star <3, (7, 6, 13)>.
   
8. For node 14: (14, 8) (14, 6) - Forming the 3-star <14, (8, 6)>.
   
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
