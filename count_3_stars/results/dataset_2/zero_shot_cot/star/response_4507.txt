Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 20) (3, 9) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 12) (25, 18) (7, 29) (7, 24) (21, 27) (21, 20) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 26) (2, 16) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 20) (1, 2) (1, 26) (1, 11) (1, 14) (26, 25) (26, 2) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 4) (17, 29) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 4) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 19) (29, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (28, 17) (28, 14) (24, 7) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 10) (4, 26) (4, 17) (27, 21) (27, 24) (27, 20) (20, 3) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 27) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 23) (15, 23) (15, 11) (12, 25) (12, 22) (12, 8) (16, 2) (16, 23) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 15) (5, 25) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 8) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 22) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 28) (23, 9) (23, 15) (23, 16) (19, 29) (19, 10) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 19) (22, 17) (22, 12) (22, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (2, 26, 14)>
<2, (18, 26, 1)>
<3, (25, 20, 9)>
<4, (26, 17, 4)>
<5, (25, 29, 18)>
<6, (14, 11, 6)>
<7, (24, 29, 7)>
<8, (12, 5, 8)>
<9, (11, 23, 9)>
<10, (24, 18, 19)>
<11, (1, 6, 11)>
<12, (25, 8, 22)>
<14, (1, 6, 14)>
<15, (11, 23, 15)>
<16, (2, 23, 16)>
<17, (26, 29, 17)>
<18, (2, 25, 18)>
<19, (29, 10, 19)>
<20, (3, 21, 20)>
<21, (27, 20, 21)>
<22, (17, 12, 22)>
<23, (16, 15, 23)>
<24, (7, 27, 24)>
<25, (3, 5, 25)>
<26, (2, 4, 26)>
<27, (21, 24, 27)>
<28, (17, 14, 28)>
<29, (7, 5, 29)>

There are a total of 29 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [29].
