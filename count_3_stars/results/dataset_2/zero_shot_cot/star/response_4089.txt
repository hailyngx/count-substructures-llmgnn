Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<5, (6, 4, 3)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<2, (1, 9, 3)>
<8, (9, 3, 0)>
<0, (6, 7, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>
<9, (2, 8, 3)>
<1, (6, 2, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
