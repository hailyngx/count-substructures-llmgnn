Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. 

From the provided edges, we identify the 3-stars:
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 14, 3)>
<1, (3, 10, 12)>
<3, (1, 9, 14)>
<8, (13, 4, 2)>
<13, (8, 3, 7)>
<10, (6, 1, 12)>
<11, (1, 12, 4)>
<4, (8, 12, 2)>
<5, (6, 1, 14)>
<2, (8, 13, 4)>
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<7, (6, 8, 0)>
<12, (1, 10, 4)>
<14, (9, 3, 5)>

So, there are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
