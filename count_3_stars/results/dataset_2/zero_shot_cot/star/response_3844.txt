Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 20) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 22) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 19) (22, 17) (22, 9) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 27) (18, 26) (18, 11) (18, 7) (18, 25) (26, 18) (26, 23) (26, 29) (26, 12) (29, 26) (29, 27) (29, 15) (29, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 3) (8, 7) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 4) (25, 18) (25, 21) (27, 13) (27, 29) (27, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (28, 1) (28, 10) (28, 2) (2, 27) (2, 28) (23, 17) (23, 26) (23, 0) (12, 14) (12, 26) (12, 0) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 10) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 11) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 15) (6, 14) (20, 14) (20, 8) (0, 23) (0, 12) (21, 25) (4, 29) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 28) (1, 16) (1, 4) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 16) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all the sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph:

<14, (17, 6, 12)>
<17, (14, 23, 5)>
<9, (22, 10, 1)>
<22, (17, 9, 2)>
<5, (17, 13, 15)>
<13, (5, 16, 11)>
<18, (26, 11, 7)>
<26, (18, 23, 29)>
<29, (26, 27, 15)>
<8, (19, 20, 3)>
<19, (9, 8, 4)>
<25, (18, 21, -)>
<27, (13, 29, 2)>
<3, (5, 8, -)>
<28, (1, 10, 2)>
<23, (17, 26, 0)>
<12, (14, 26, 0)>
<16, (13, 1, 10)>
<7, (18, 8, 11)>
<6, (14, -, -)>
<20, (14, 8, -)>
<0, (23, 12, -)>
<21, (25, -, -)>
<4, (29, 19, 11)>
<1, (9, 28, 16)>
<10, (9, 28, 16)>
<15, (5, 29, 11)>

There are a total of 26 unique 3-stars in this graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
