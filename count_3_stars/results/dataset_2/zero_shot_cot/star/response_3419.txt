Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 9) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern in the graph.

<10, (1, 2, 3)>
<11, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 12, 13)>
<5, (0, 7, 10)>
<13, (0, 5, 14)>
<4, (2, 6, 12)>
<12, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 11)>
<1, (0, 8, 10)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (6, 9, 10)>
<14, (2, 13, 4)>
<2, (4, 13, 14)>
<9, (3, 10, 0)>

Counting all unique 3-star patterns, we get a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph.
