Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (7, 6, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 13)>
<1, (4, 3, 10)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 11)>
<9, (4, 3, 14)>
<2, (4, 3, 5)>
<5, (7, 2, 13)>
<13, (7, 2, 11)>
<0, (13, 11, 12)>
<10, (1, 2, 14)>
<11, (6, 7, 13)>
<14, (3, 9, 10)>
<12, (3, 8, 14)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 14 of them. Thus, the final answer is [14].
