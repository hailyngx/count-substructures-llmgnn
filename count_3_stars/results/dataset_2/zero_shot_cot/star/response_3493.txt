Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 6) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 12) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 8, 11)>
2. <2, (13, 14, 5)>
3. <3, (1, 6, 7)>
4. <4, (8, 10, 12)>
5. <5, (10, 14, 2)>
6. <6, (1, 3, 14)>
7. <7, (3, 0, 14)>
8. <8, (13, 4, 11)>
9. <10, (12, 4, 9)>
10. <12, (13, 10, 5)>
11. <13, (8, 12, 2)>
12. <14, (0, 7, 5)>

There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [12].
