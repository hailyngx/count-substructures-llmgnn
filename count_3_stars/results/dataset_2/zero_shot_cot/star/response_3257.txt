Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 4, and 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 1, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 0, 1, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 6, 2, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 7, 8, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 6, 2, and 3.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 7, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- The possible 3-stars involving node 5 are:
  - <5, (9, 2, 4)> [1]
  - <5, (9, 2, 0)> [2]
  - <5, (9, 4, 0)> [3]

- The possible 3-stars involving node 9 are:
  - <9, (5, 8, 1)> [4]
  - <9, (5, 8, 7)> [5]

- The possible 3-stars involving node 4 are:
  - <4, (5, 0, 1)> [6]
  - <4, (5, 0, 2)> [7]

- The possible 3-stars involving node 7 are:
  - <7, (9, 0, 6)> [8]
  - <7, (9, 0, 8)> [9]
  - <7, (9, 6, 8)> [10]

- The possible 3-stars involving node 2 are:
  - <2, (5, 7, 8)> [11]
  
- The possible 3-stars involving node 8 are:
  - <8, (9, 6, 7)> [12]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
