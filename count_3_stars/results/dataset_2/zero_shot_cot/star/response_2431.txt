Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. A central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
After examining the edges, we find the potential central nodes with their connected nodes:
- (5, 9, 1, 4, 0, 3)
- (9, 5, 4, 3, 0)
- (1, 5, 6, 0, 8)
- (3, 5, 9, 7, 6)
- (4, 5, 9, 8, 2)
- (8, 1, 4, 7)
- (2, 4, 6, 7)
- (0, 5, 9, 1, 6)

Next, we need to check which of these pairs form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of the central node and exactly three other nodes it is connected to.
Let's identify the unique 3-stars:

<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<5, (9, 0, 3)>
<5, (1, 0, 6)>
<5, (4, 0, 3)>
<5, (3, 9, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 0, 1)>
<1, (5, 6, 0)>
<1, (5, 8, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<4, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 2)>
<8, (1, 7, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 9, 1)>
<0, (5, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars listed above, we get a total of [19] 3-stars in the given graph.
