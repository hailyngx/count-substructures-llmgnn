2. Node 5: (5, 29, 10)
3. Node 14: (14, 17, 28), (14, 17, 1)
4. Node 17: (17, 14, 28)
5. Node 4: (4, 23, 20)
6. Node 18: (18, 25, 8)
7. Node 13: (13, 26, 16)
8. Node 0: (0, 7, 8)
9. Node 7: (7, 16, 0)
10. Node 16: (16, 26, 13), (16, 26, 7), (16, 26, 29)
11. Node 1: (1, 14, 25)
12. Node 6: (6, 10, 19)
13. Node 11: (11, 2, 25)
14. Node 8: (8, 18, 25)
15. Node 28: (28, 14, 17)
16. Node 15: (15, 26, 19)
17. Node 19: (19, 9, 15)
18. Node 3: (3, 26, 17)
19. Node 29: (29, 5, 10)
20. Node 24: (24, 9, 17), (24, 17, 8), (24, 17, 12), (24, 12, 21)
21. Node 25: (25, 18, 2), (25, 1, 23), (25, 23, 2)
22. Node 10: (10, 5, 19)
23. Node 22: (22, 17, 15)
24. Node 12: (12, 29, 24), (12, 24, 21)
25. Node 2: (2, 11, 25)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
