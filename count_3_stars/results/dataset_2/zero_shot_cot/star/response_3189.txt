Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all nodes that have exactly three incident edges, as those nodes can be potential centers of 3-stars. Then, we check all possible pairs of nodes that are connected to the identified center nodes and count the number of 3-stars that can be formed.

First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three incident edges:
- Node 5 has 4 incident edges: (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 0)
- Node 9 has 3 incident edges: (9, 5), (9, 1), (9, 7)
- Node 4 has 5 incident edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 3), (4, 2)
- Node 7 has 4 incident edges: (7, 9), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2)
- Node 1 has 5 incident edges: (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 8)
- Node 8 has 5 incident edges: (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 0)
- Node 3 has 4 incident edges: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2)
- Node 2 has 6 incident edges: (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 8)
- Node 0 has 3 incident edges: (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 8)

Now, let's generate all possible 3-stars:
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (5, 4, 1)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>

There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the answer is [6].
