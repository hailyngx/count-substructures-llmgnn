Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
At first, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These will be the potential central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes: 6, 2, 8, 4.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes: 6, 8, 3.
- Node 6 is connected to 4 other nodes: 5, 9, 2, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to 4 other nodes: 3, 0, 8, 7.
- Node 3 is connected to 3 other nodes: 9, 1, 4.
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes: 5, 3, 7.
- Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes: 1, 4, 0, 2.
- Node 0 is connected to 4 other nodes: 1, 4, 7, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to 5 other nodes: 5, 9, 6, 1, 7.
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes: 5, 6, 7.

Based on the connections, we see that the potential 3-stars can be formed with central nodes 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, 0, and 8. Let's count the number of unique 3-stars for each central node:

- Central node 5: There are 3 unique 3-stars with node 5 as the center: <5, (6, 2, 8)>, <5, (6, 9, 4)>, <5, (6, 8, 2)>.
- Central node 9: There are 2 unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (6, 8, 3)>, <9, (6, 5, 8)>.
- Central node 6: There are 3 unique 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 2, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 2)>.
- Central node 1: There is 1 unique 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (3, 0, 8)>.
- Central node 7: There is 1 unique 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (4, 0, 1)>.
- Central node 0: There is 1 unique 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 4, 7)>.
- Central node 8: There is 1 unique 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (5, 9, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is the sum of the unique 3-stars for each central node: 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12. 

So, we write the final answer inside brackets: [12].
