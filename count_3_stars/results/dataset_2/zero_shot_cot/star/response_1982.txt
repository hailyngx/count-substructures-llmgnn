Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 17) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 0) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 19) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 3) (16, 17) (17, 15) (17, 8) (17, 16) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 18) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 19) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Then, we can identify the nodes connected to these central nodes to form 3-star graphs.

Central nodes with three edges connected to them:
- Node 3
- Node 5
- Node 10
- Node 15

Number of 3-stars: [6]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 8, 18)>
<5, (3, 6, 12)>
<10, (5, 13, 19)>
<15, (3, 17, 19)>
<3, (15, 16, 18)>
<3, (5, 8, 16)>
