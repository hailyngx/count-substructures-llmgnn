Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with the highest degree, which are nodes 6, 7, and 2 with degree 6 each. This suggests that each of these nodes might act as a center of a 3-star. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars with these nodes as the center:
- For node 6, the 3-stars are: <6, (9, 3, 1)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, and <6, (3, 2, 8)>.
- For node 7, the 3-stars are: <7, (6, 1, 3)>, <7, (1, 4, 2)>, and <7, (3, 6, 0)>.
- For node 2, the 3-stars are: <2, (5, 6, 4)>, <2, (6, 8, 7)>, and <2, (0, 8, 7)>.

So, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
