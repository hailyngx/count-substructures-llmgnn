Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a central node and three adjacent nodes. 

Based on the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <6, (1, 4, 0)>
2. <9, (8, 2, 1)>
3. <1, (6, 3, 2)>
4. <3, (1, 0, 5)>
5. <4, (6, 7, 0)>
6. <7, (9, 4, 5)>
7. <8, (9, 3, 7)>
8. <5, (3, 7, 0)>
9. <0, (6, 3, 4)>
10. <2, (9, 1, 0)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. So, the answer is [10].
