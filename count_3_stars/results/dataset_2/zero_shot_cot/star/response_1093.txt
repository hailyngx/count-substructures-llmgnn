Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 13) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 21) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 20) (2, 22) (2, 17) (2, 0) (29, 0) (29, 24) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 14) (20, 5) (25, 20) (8, 13) (8, 21) (8, 6) (13, 15) (13, 27) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 18) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 12) (22, 2) (22, 10) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 9) (26, 1) (26, 23) (26, 11) (21, 4) (21, 8) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 23) (24, 29) (24, 11) (6, 8) (6, 21) (3, 16) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 2) (23, 26) (23, 28) (11, 27) (11, 18) (11, 26) (11, 24) (19, 15) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 19) (16, 14) (9, 1) (9, 10) (5, 20) (5, 10) (0, 2) (0, 29) (0, 19) (10, 22) (10, 9) (10, 5) (12, 18) (12, 19) (12, 14) (14, 20) (14, 13) (14, 21) (14, 16) (14, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 18), (4, 21)
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 20)
- Node 13: (13, 15), (13, 27), (13, 8), (13, 14), (13, 18)
- Node 14: (14, 20), (14, 13), (14, 21), (14, 16), (14, 12)
- Node 21: (21, 4), (21, 8), (21, 28), (21, 6), (21, 14)
- Node 27: (27, 15), (27, 11), (27, 17), (27, 13)
- Node 18: (18, 4), (18, 13), (18, 11), (18, 12)

2. Identify the 3-stars from the above nodes:

- <4, (7, 18, 21)>
- <13, (15, 27, 8)>
- <14, (20, 21, 16)>
- <18, (4, 13, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
