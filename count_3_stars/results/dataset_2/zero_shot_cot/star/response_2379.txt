Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <6, (9, 10, 12)>
2. <9, (6, 8, 11)>
3. <10, (6, 11, 12)>
4. <11, (9, 10, 5)>
5. <7, (12, 2, 5)>
6. <12, (6, 9, 10)>
7. <2, (7, 4, 13)>
8. <8, (9, 12, 1)>
9. <3, (10, 11, 0)>
10. <0, (3, 4, 1)>
11. <5, (10, 11, 7)>
12. <13, (2, 5, 1)>
13. <1, (7, 8, 0)>
14. <4, (9, 2, 3)>
15. <14, (6, 3, 4)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
