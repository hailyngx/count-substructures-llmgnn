Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 7) (18, 15) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 16) (14, 11) (14, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 19) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 18) (15, 10) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 7) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (4, 15) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 3) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 16, and 17: <2, (1, 16, 17)>
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 10, and 19: <1, (2, 10, 19)>
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 2, 13, and 11: <17, (2, 13, 11)>
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 15, and 19: <10, (1, 15, 19)>
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 18, 10, and 4: <15, (18, 10, 4)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 17, 12, and 4: <13, (17, 12, 4)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 19, 6, and 7: <8, (19, 6, 7)>
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 8: <19, (1, 10, 8)>
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 0, and 4: <16, (2, 0, 4)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 19, and 11: <6, (8, 19, 11)>
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 6: <11, (14, 17, 6)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 14, 13, and 4: <3, (14, 13, 4)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 8: <7, (9, 2, 8)>

Now we count the number of 3-stars: 
There are 13 unique 3-stars as listed above, so the total number of 3-stars is [13].
