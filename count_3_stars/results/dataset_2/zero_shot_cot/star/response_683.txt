Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 9) (16, 19) (16, 5) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 7) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (7, 17) (7, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 5) (9, 11) (10, 5) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 18) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 5) (12, 17) (12, 1) (12, 6) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (3, 8, 18)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 19)>
<3, (0, 4, 14)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<5, (4, 5, 16)>
<6, (2, 12, 13)>
<8, (0, 1, 19)>
<12, (1, 6, 17)>
<13, (6, 17, 19)>
<14, (3, 11, 2)>
<16, (5, 19, 0)>
<17, (13, 17, 18)>
<18, (0, 8, 5)>
<19, (8, 13, 16)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
