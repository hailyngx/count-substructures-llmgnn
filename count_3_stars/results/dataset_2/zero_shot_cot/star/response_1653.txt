Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 9) (1, 13) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 9) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph.

The possible 3-stars structures are:
<4, (7, 12, 5)>
<7, (4, 11, 6)>
<8, (13, 14, 3)>
<13, (8, 1, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 0)>
<6, (7, 13, 5)>
<12, (4, 10, 0)>
<1, (13, 6, 0)>
<2, (3, 14, 11)>
<3, (7, 8, 2)>
<0, (5, 6, 12)>
<11, (4, 7, 2)>
<14, (7, 8, 2)>
<10, (6, 12, 1)>
<9, (12, 11, 14)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars, which is 15 in this graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
