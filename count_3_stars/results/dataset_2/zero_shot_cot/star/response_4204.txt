Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (15, 8) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 18) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 1) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 17) (9, 15) (9, 13) (12, 19) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 2) (0, 19) (1, 7) (1, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 1) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Count the number of occurrences of each node in the given edges:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 4
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2
- Node 10: 3
- Node 11: 3
- Node 12: 4
- Node 13: 3
- Node 14: 2
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 3
- Node 17: 3
- Node 18: 3
- Node 19: 2

2. Identify the 3-stars by finding nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Based on the counts above, we find the 3-stars: 
<2, (0, 10, 14)>
<3, (7, 9, 13)>
<6, (11, 12, 18)>
<7, (1, 5, 10)>
<8, (2, 6, 15)>
<10, (1, 2, 7)>
<12, (6, 11, 17)>
<15, (8, 9, 18)>
<16, (8, 15, 17)>
<18, (3, 6, 15)>

3. Now count the total number of 3-stars found:
