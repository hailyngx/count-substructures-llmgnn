Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (4, 9) (4, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are connected to only three other nodes, forming a 3-star. Let's list them:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 10, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 11.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 14.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 8.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 4.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 12.

Now, we can form the unique 3-stars. Let's list them:

<0, (2, 10, 14)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (9, 11, 14)>
<5, (1, 8, 11)>
<7, (10, 11, 14)>
<9, (1, 4, 14)>
<10, (0, 7, 8)>
<11, (5, 7, 4)>
<13, (0, 1, 12)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [10].
