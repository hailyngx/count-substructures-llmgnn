Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5: <5, (9, 1, 0)>
2. Node 9: <9, (5, 4, 2)>
3. Node 4: <4, (9, 8, 2)>
4. Node 7: <7, (5, 3, -)>
5. Node 1: <1, (5, 9, 2)>
6. Node 3: <3, (9, 7, 0)>
7. Node 8: <8, (4, 3, 2)>
8. Node 6: <6, (5, 8, 0)>
9. Node 2: <2, (9, 4, 1)>
10. Node 0: <0, (5, 9, 1)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
