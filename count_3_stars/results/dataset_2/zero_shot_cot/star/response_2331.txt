Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 10) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 11) (13, 3) (13, 9) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (15, 10) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 14) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 12) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 3) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 12) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 8) (11, 19) (14, 9) (14, 16) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars in the graph. Let's start by looking at each node and its neighbors to identify the 3-stars:

1. Node 0: (0, 5, 8), (0, 12, 3)
2. Node 1: (1, 2, 10)
3. Node 2: (2, 1, 10)
4. Node 3: (3, 12, 13), (3, 4, 12)
5. Node 4: (4, 2, 10), (4, 3, 12), (4, 6, 7)
6. Node 5: No 3-stars as it only has one neighbor
7. Node 6: (6, 4, 7)
8. Node 7: (7, 2, 10), (7, 4, 6), (7, 8, 10)
9. Node 8: (8, 0, 12), (8, 7, 10)
10. Node 9: No 3-stars as it only has two neighbors
11. Node 10: (10, 1, 2), (10, 4, 7), (10, 7, 8)
12. Node 11: No 3-stars as it only has three neighbors
13. Node 12: (12, 0, 3), (12, 3, 4), (12, 8, 16)
14. Node 13: (13, 3, 12)
15. Node 14: No 3-stars as it only has two neighbors
16. Node 15: No 3-stars as it only has two neighbors
17. Node 16: No 3-stars as it only has three neighbors
18. Node 17: No 3-stars as it only has three neighbors
19. Node 18: No 3-stars as it only has two neighbors
20. Node 19: No 3-stars as it only has three neighbors

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (5, 8, 12)>, <0, (5, 8, 12)>, <3, (4, 12, 13)>, <4, (6, 7, 10)>, <4, (2, 10, 6)>, <7, (8, 4, 10)>, <10, (1, 2, 7)>, <12, (3, 0, 8)>, <13, (3, 12, 9)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
