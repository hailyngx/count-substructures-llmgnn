Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (16, 9) (16, 5) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 6) (27, 13) (27, 8) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 25) (29, 0) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 15) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 26) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 17) (5, 16) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 5) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (23, 8) (23, 3) (21, 28) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 4) (28, 21) (28, 22) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 21) (26, 2) (26, 12) (26, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 19) (20, 21) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 22) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 9) (15, 29) (15, 19) (19, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 23) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 3) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 25) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 10) (13, 27) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of at least one star. We notice that nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 have at least one edge connected to them.

Next, we can go through each of these nodes and find if they are a central node in a 3-star. A 3-star is uniquely defined by its central node and the three connected leaves.

1. For node 0:
   - (0, 27), (0, 7), (0, 10), (0, 4), (0, 29) suggest possible 3-stars: <0, (27, 7, 10)>, <0, (27, 4, 29)>, <0, (7, 10, 4)>, <0, (10, 29, 4)>
   
2. For node 2:
   - (2, 29), (2, 18), (2, 26), (2, 10), (2, 25) suggest possible 3-stars: <2, (29, 18, 26)>, <2, (29, 18, 10)>, <2, (29, 26, 25)>, <2, (18, 26, 10)>, <2, (18, 10, 25)>

3. For node 4:
   - (4, 0), (4, 8), (4, 21) suggest possible 3-stars: <4, (0, 8, 21)>

4. For node 6:
   - (6, 11), (6, 27), (6, 5) suggest possible 3-stars: <6, (11, 27, 5)>

5. For node 10:
   - (10, 0), (10, 2), (10, 26), (10, 9) suggest possible 3-stars: <10, (0, 2, 26)>, <10, (0, 9, 26)>, <10, (2, 26, 9)>

6. For node 12:
   - (12, 17), (12, 3), (12, 26) suggest possible 3-stars: <12, (17, 3, 26)>

7. For node 17:
   - (17, 12), (17, 18), (17, 19) suggest possible 3-stars: <17, (12, 18, 19)>

8. For node 18:
   - (18, 2), (18, 14), (18, 7), (18, 17) suggest possible 3-stars: <18, (2, 14, 7)>, <18, (2, 7, 17)>, <18, (14, 7, 17)>

9. For node 19:
   - (19, 29), (19, 17), (19, 15) suggest possible 3-stars: <19, (29, 17, 15)>

10. For node 21:
    - (21, 28), (21, 20), (21, 22), (21, 4) suggest no 3-stars.

11. For node 22:
    - (22, 21), (22, 28), (22, 25) suggest no 3-stars.

12. For node 25:
    - (25, 2), (25, 7), (25, 1), (25, 22) suggest possible 3-stars: <25, (2, 7, 1)>, <25, (2, 1, 22)>, <25, (7, 1, 22)>

13. For node 26:
    - (26, 2), (26, 12), (26, 10) suggest no 3-stars.

14. For node 27:
    - (27, 0), (27, 6), (27, 13), (27, 8) suggest no 3-stars.

15. For node 28:
    - (28, 21), (28, 22) suggest no 3-stars.

16. For node 29:
    - (29, 0), (29, 2), (29, 19), (29, 15) suggest no 3-stars.

Combining all the unique 3-stars found, we have:
<0, (27, 7, 10)>, <0, (27, 4, 29)>, <0, (7, 10, 4)>, <0, (10, 29, 4)>,
<2, (29, 18, 26)>, <2, (29, 18, 10)>, <2, (29, 26, 25)>, <2, (18, 26, 10)>, <2, (18, 10, 25)>,
<4, (0, 8, 21)>,
<6, (11, 27, 5)>,
<10, (0, 2, 26)>, <10, (0, 9, 26)>, <10, (2, 26, 9)>,
<12, (17, 3, 26)>,
<17, (12, 18, 19)>,
<18, (2, 14, 7)>, <18, (2, 7, 17)>, <18, (14, 7, 17)>,
<19, (29, 17, 15)>,
<25, (2, 7, 1)>, <25, (2, 1, 22)>, <25, (7, 1, 22)>

Therefore, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
