Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 10) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph.

<4, (9, 13, 0)>
<7, (3, 5, 13)>
<1, (3, 11, 13)>
<3, (1, 8, 7)>
<8, (3, 10, 11)>
<13, (4, 7, 1)>
<6, (4, 9, 14)>
<9, (4, 6, 11)>
<0, (4, 9, 14)>
<14, (6, 0, 12)>
<2, (6, 10, 11)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<10, (8, 2, 5)>
<12, (13, 9, 14)>
<11, (1, 13, 9)>

So, there are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The final answer is [15].
