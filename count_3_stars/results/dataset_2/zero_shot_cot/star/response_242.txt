Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
The <6, (5, 7, 0)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

The <9, (8, 2, 3)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

The <4, (7, 8, 3)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

The <7, (6, 4, 1)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

The <1, (7, 5, 0)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

The <3, (9, 4, 8)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

The <8, (9, 4, 1)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

The <5, (6, 1, 0)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

The <0, (6, 9, 1)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

The <2, (9, 4, 7)> 3-star is present in the given graph.

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
