Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which represent the potential center nodes of 3-stars. These nodes have a degree of 3 in the graph.

Nodes with degree 3: 5, 4, 7, 2

Now, let's check each of these potential center nodes and see if they are at the center of a 3-star.

For node 5:
- (5, 1), (5, 7) are the edges connected to node 5, making a potential 3-star: <5, (1, 7, -)>
- There is only one potential 3-star with center node 5.

For node 4:
- (4, 3), (4, 1), (4, 6) are the edges connected to node 4, making a potential 3-star: <4, (3, 1, 6)>
- There is only one potential 3-star with center node 4.

For node 7:
- (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8) are the edges connected to node 7, making a potential 3-star: <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- There is only one potential 3-star with center node 7.

For node 2:
- (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 8) are the edges connected to node 2, making three potential 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- There are three potential 3-stars with center node 2.

Therefore, the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 5.
