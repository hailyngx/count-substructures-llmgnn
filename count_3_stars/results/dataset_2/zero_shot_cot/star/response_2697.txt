Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 27) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 4) (18, 0) (22, 26) (22, 15) (22, 7) (7, 22) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 27) (12, 8) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 25) (29, 5) (29, 23) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 24) (21, 6) (21, 4) (21, 23) (21, 2) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 17) (11, 7) (11, 14) (23, 29) (23, 21) (23, 1) (23, 3) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 19) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 15) (25, 28) (25, 27) (25, 17) (27, 9) (27, 7) (27, 25) (27, 8) (17, 5) (17, 26) (17, 25) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 24) (2, 21) (2, 19) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 19) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 0) (3, 14) (8, 12) (8, 28) (8, 27) (1, 23) (1, 13) (20, 26) (20, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 24) (19, 10) (10, 20) (10, 19) (15, 5) (15, 22) (15, 16) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges, which are potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 5 has neighbors: 9, 29, 17, 0, 15
- Node 9 has neighbors: 5, 6, 27
- Node 6 has neighbors: 9, 28, 21, 4
- Node 26 has neighbors: 22, 20, 16, 17
- Node 21 has neighbors: 6, 4, 23, 2
- Node 0 has neighbors: 5, 18, 16, 3, 19
- Node 16 has neighbors: 26, 0, 15
- Node 7 has neighbors: 22, 3, 11, 27
- Node 11 has neighbors: 7, 14, 3
- Node 23 has neighbors: 29, 21, 1, 3
- Node 17 has neighbors: 5, 26, 25
- Node 24 has neighbors: 4, 14, 19
- Node 10 has neighbors: 20, 19
- Node 8 has neighbors: 12, 28, 27
- Node 2 has neighbors: 21, 19
- Node 25 has neighbors: 28, 27, 17
- Node 14 has neighbors: 11, 3, 24

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <5, (9, 29, 17)>
- <9, (5, 6, 27)>
- <6, (9, 28, 21)>
- <26, (22, 20, 16)>
- <21, (6, 4, 23)>
- <0, (5, 18, 16)>
- <16, (26, 0, 15)>
- <7, (22, 3, 11)>
- <11, (7, 14, 3)>
- <23, (29, 21, 1)>
- <17, (5, 26, 25)>
- <24, (4, 14, 19)>
- <10, (20, 19, 10)>
- <8, (12, 28, 27)>
- <2, (21, 19, 2)>
- <25, (28, 27, 17)>

From the identified 3-stars, we can see that there are 16 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].
