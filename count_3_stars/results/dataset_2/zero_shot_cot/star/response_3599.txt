Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 29) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 14) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 6) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 26) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (22, 5) (22, 28) (23, 25) (23, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 1) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (2, 27) (2, 6) (2, 20) (18, 0) (18, 8) (20, 15) (20, 2) (5, 16) (5, 22) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 3) (26, 27) (8, 17) (8, 18) (8, 19) (8, 21) (19, 23) (19, 8) (19, 29) (4, 6) (4, 3) (12, 15) (12, 25) (12, 1) (21, 16) (21, 8) (21, 24) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 28) (3, 13) (3, 4) (24, 21) (24, 7) (7, 9) (7, 24) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 25) (25, 11) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 1) (29, 11) (29, 19) (29, 0) (28, 22) (28, 14) (0, 18) (0, 29) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by looking for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the edges and find the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 1: (9, 1) (10, 1) (12, 1) (25, 1) - <1, (9, 10, 12)>
2. Node 2: (27, 2) (6, 2) (20, 2) - <2, (27, 6, 20)>
3. Node 3: (13, 3) (4, 3) - <3, (13, 4, 0)>
4. Node 4: (4, 3) (6, 4) - <4, (3, 6, 13)>
5. Node 5: (13, 5) (5, 13) (22, 5) - <5, (13, 22, 16)>
6. Node 6: (13, 6) (4, 6) (15, 6) - <6, (13, 4, 15)>
7. Node 7: (24, 7) (9, 7) - <7, (24, 9, 0)>
8. Node 8: (8, 17) (8, 18) (21, 8) - <8, (17, 18, 21)>
9. Node 9: (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 9) - <9, (14, 1, 7)>
10. Node 10: (10, 17) (10, 1) (15, 10) - <10, (17, 1, 15)>
11. Node 11: (25, 11) (29, 11) (16, 11) - <11, (25, 29, 16)>
12. Node 12: (12, 15) (1, 12) (25, 12) - <12, (15, 1, 25)>
13. Node 13: (6, 13) (13, 3) (5, 13) - <13, (6, 5, 3)>
14. Node 14: (9, 14) (14, 28) (16, 14) - <14, (9, 28, 16)>
15. Node 15: (20, 15) (12, 15) (10, 15) - <15, (20, 12, 10)>
16. Node 16: (14, 16) (5, 16) (11, 16) - <16, (14, 5, 11)>
17. Node 17: (17, 8) (10, 17) (13, 17) - <17, (8, 10, 13)>
18. Node 18: (8, 17) (0, 18) (18, 8) - <18, (17, 0, 8)>
19. Node 19: (19, 8) (23, 19) (29, 19) - <19, (8, 23, 29)>
20. Node 20: (27, 20) (2, 20) (15, 20) - <20, (27, 2, 15)>
21. Node 21: (21, 8) (16, 21) (24, 21) - <21, (8, 16, 24)>
22. Node 22: (22, 5) (22, 28) - <22, (5, 28, 16)>
23. Node 23: (25, 23) (19, 23) - <23, (25, 19, 8)>
24. Node 24: (21, 24) (7, 24) - <24, (21, 7, 16)>
25. Node 25: (25, 1) (25, 12) (23, 25) - <25, (1, 12, 23)>
26. Node 26: (27, 26) - <26, (27, 2, 15)>
27. Node 27: (27, 2) (26, 27) (15, 27) - <27, (2, 26, 15)>
28. Node 28: (14, 28) (28, 22) - <28, (14, 22, 16)>
29. Node 29: (29, 19) (0, 29) (11, 29) - <29, (19, 0, 11)>
30. Node 0: (18, 0) (29, 0) - <0, (18, 29, 3)>

There are 30 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
