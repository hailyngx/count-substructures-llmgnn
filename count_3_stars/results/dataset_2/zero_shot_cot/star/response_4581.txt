Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-star structures:

<5, (6, 2, 1)>
<9, (4, 2, 1)>
<1, (5, 9, 8)>
<3, (7, 6, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (5, 3, 8)>
<0, (9, 8, 6)>
<7, (3, 8, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the graph.
