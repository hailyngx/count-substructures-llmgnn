Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 1) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 12) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 17) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 18) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 10) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 6) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would form the leaves of the 3-stars. 
From the given edges, we have the following nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 14, and 19.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 13, and 18.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 17.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 14.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 17.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 19.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 17.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 14.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 11, and 14.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars by counting the combinations of these nodes forming a 3-star structure with a central node connected to exactly three leaves.

Calculating the number of 3-stars: 10 possible central nodes (1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 16, 18, 19) where each node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes, so the total number of 3-stars is: 10.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars is [10].

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 14, 19)>
<3, (0, 13, 18)>
<6, (4, 10, 12)>
<7, (2, 5, 17)>
<8, (2, 11, 14)>
<11, (5, 8, 17)>
<14, (0, 1, 19)>
<16, (10, 13, 17)>
<18, (3, 6, 14)>
<19, (0, 11, 14)>
