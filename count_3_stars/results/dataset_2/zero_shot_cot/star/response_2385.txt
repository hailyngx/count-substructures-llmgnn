Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 13) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (12, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 10) 

Response:
The central node needs to have exactly three edges to form a 3-star. Let's find the possible 3-stars by examining each node in the graph:

- Node 0: (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 14) -> <0, (3, 5, 9)> [1]
- Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 6), (1, 7) -> <1, (2, 6, 7)> [1]
- Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 7) -> <2, (1, 5, 7)> [1]
- Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 8), (3, 13) -> <3, (0, 8, 13)> [1]
- Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8) -> <4, (6, 7, 8)> [1]
- Node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 10) -> <5, (0, 2, 10)> [1]
- Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 8) -> <6, (1, 4, 8)> [1]
- Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 8) -> <7, (1, 4, 8)> [1]
- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6) -> <8, (3, 4, 6)> [1]
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 8), (9, 11) -> <9, (0, 8, 11)> [1]
- Node 10: (10, 4), (10, 5), (10, 13) -> <10, (4, 5, 13)> [1]
- Node 11: (11, 7), (11, 9) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 12: (12, 5) -> Not a 3-star
- Node 13: (13, 3), (13, 4), (13, 10) -> <13, (3, 4, 10)> [1]
- Node 14: (14, 0), (14, 4), (14, 5) -> <14, (0, 4, 5)> [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
