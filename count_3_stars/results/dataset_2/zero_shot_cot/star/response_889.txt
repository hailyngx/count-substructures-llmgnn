Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (6, 9, 7)>
<7, (6, 9, 1)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 7, 6)>
<2, (8, 5, 1)>
<8, (9, 2, 5)>
<1, (7, 2, 5)>
<3, (7, 6, 9)>
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 1)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10].
