Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-star structures in the graph can be represented as follows:
- <0, (5, 8, 1)>
- <1, (9, 6, 7)>
- <2, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (4, 8, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have 4 in total.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
