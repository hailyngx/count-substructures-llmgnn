Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (10, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 12, and 11. This forms a 3-star with node 5 as the center. <5, (13, 12, 11)>

2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 1. This forms a 3-star with node 9 as the center. <9, (4, 3, 1)>

3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 0. This forms a 3-star with node 4 as the center. <4, (9, 7, 0)>

4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 14. This forms a 3-star with node 7 as the center. <7, (4, 6, 14)>

5. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 14. This forms a 3-star with node 1 as the center. <1, (9, 3, 14)>

6. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 13, and 14. This forms a 3-star with node 8 as the center. <8, (1, 13, 14)>

7. Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 12. This forms a 3-star with node 13 as the center. <13, (5, 8, 12)>

8. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 13, and 12. This forms a 3-star with node 2 as the center. <2, (7, 13, 12)>

9. Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 12. This forms a 3-star with node 11 as the center. <11, (5, 2, 12)>

10. Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 0. This forms a 3-star with node 6 as the center. <6, (7, 8, 0)>

There are no more unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Count of 3-stars in the graph: [10]
