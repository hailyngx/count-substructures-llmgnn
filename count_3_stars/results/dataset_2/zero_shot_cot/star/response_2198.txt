Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the nodes that are connected to node 6:

Connected to node 6: 1, 14, 8, 4

Now, let's find all the 3-star configurations with node 6 as the central node:
<6, (1, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 4, 14)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
[2]
