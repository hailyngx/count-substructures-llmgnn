Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 10) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
To find 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes and form a 3-star configuration around them. Since each 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes, we will search for nodes that satisfy this property.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (6, 2, 3)>
<9, (8, 13, 14)>
<1, (11, 0, 14)>
<3, (5, 0, )}
<8, (9, 10, 12)>
<13, (9, 0, 12)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<7, (1, 6, 12)>
<12, (9, 8, 13)>
<11, (1, 7, 4)>
<2, (5, 11, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 13)>
<4, (6, 11, 2)>
<14, (5, 9, 1)>
<10, (8, 2, )}

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the count of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
