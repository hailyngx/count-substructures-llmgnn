Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves. Nodes with exactly three edges are potential central nodes of 3-stars. Let's list them:
- Node 0 has 5 edges
- Node 1 has 4 edges
- Node 2 has 4 edges
- Node 3 has 3 edges
- Node 4 has 4 edges
- Node 5 has 3 edges
- Node 6 has 5 edges
- Node 7 has 4 edges
- Node 8 has 4 edges
- Node 9 has 4 edges

Nodes 3 and 5 have exactly 3 edges, so they are central nodes of potential 3-stars. Let's examine them further:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 2, 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 2

From the given edges, we can see that both node 3 and node 5 have the necessary connections to form 3-stars. So we have two 3-stars in this graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (6, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 6, 2)>
