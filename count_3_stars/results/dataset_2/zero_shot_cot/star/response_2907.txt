Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can find all the pairs of nodes with a common neighbor (center node). Since every 3-star contributes to 3 pairs of nodes, we will divide the total count of such pairs by 3 to find the number of 3-stars.

Let's start by finding all pairs of nodes with a common neighbor:

(5, 9, 6), (5, 9, 0), (5, 9, 10), (9, 6, 12), (9, 6, 1), (6, 0, 5), (6, 9, 12), (1, 9, 3), (1, 9, 2), (3, 1, 0), (10, 5, 0), (10, 5, 12), (4, 12, 8), (4, 12, 2), (4, 12, 14)

Counting these pairs, we find there are 14 such pairs. Since each pair corresponds to a 3-star, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14 / 3].

Therefore, the final answer is [4]. 

Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (6, 5, 12)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<10, (5, 0, 12)>
