Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 14) (0, 15) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 7) (15, 0) (15, 1) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 5) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 10) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 16) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <4, (11, 18, 17)>
2. <7, (1, 9, 11)>
3. <10, (5, 7, 13)>
4. <13, (2, 8, 10)>
5. <17, (0, 4, 18)>
6. <18, (3, 4, 17)>
7. <11, (4, 7, 13)>
8. <3, (9, 16, 18)>
9. <14, (0, 5, 17)>
   
Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. This is represented as [9].
