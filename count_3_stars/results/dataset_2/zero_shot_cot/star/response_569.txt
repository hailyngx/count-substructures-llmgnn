Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 19) (14, 2) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 19) (2, 14) (2, 3) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 5) (6, 15) (4, 17) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 13) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 13) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 10) (19, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the unique 3-stars below:

<4, (18, 17, 10)>
<9, (16, 15, 12)>
<15, (6, 9, 8)>
<6, (5, 17, 15)>
<5, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (19, 13, 3)>
<3, (16, 2, 5)>
<17, (6, 4, 18)>
<18, (4, 9, 17)>
<16, (9, 3, 19)>
<10, (4, 1, 19)>
<8, (15, 7, 5)>
<7, (8, 5, 17)>
<13, (4, 1, 0)>
<1, (13, 10, 11)>
<19, (0, 10, 16)>
<2, (14, 3, 5)>

Therefore, there are [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
