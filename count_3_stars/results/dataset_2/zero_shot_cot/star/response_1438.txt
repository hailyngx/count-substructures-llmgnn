Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star must have degree 3, which means they are connected to exactly three other nodes. We can start by identifying all nodes with degree 3. From the given edges, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 meet this criterion. Let's consider each of these nodes as potential centers of 3-stars and check if they indeed form any 3-stars.

1. For node 1:
   - (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 6), and (1, 4) - Node 1 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. For node 2:
   - (2, 9), (2, 6), and (2, 3) - Node 2 satisfies the conditions and forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 3.
   <2, (9, 6, 3)>

3. For node 3:
  - (3, 9), (3, 2), and (3, 4) - Node 3 satisfies the conditions and forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 4.
  <3, (9, 2, 4)>

4. For node 4:
  - (4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 1), and (4, 6) - Node 4 is not connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2]. 

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (9, 6, 3)>
<3, (9, 2, 4)>
