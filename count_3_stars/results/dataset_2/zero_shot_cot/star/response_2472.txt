Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 8) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 10) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (16, 12) (16, 9) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 13) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 1) (19, 17) (19, 6) (7, 17) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (1, 12) (1, 18) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 12) 

Response:
The steps to count the number of 3-stars in this graph are as follows:

1. Identify the nodes that have 3 edges connected to them, as these nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star.
2. For each potential center node, check if the other connected nodes form a 3-star pattern with the center node.

Based on the given edges, the nodes with 3 edges connected to them are: 5, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17.

Let's count the number of 3-stars involving each of these potential center nodes:
- For node 5: <5, (10, 18, 0)>.
- For node 8: <8, (4, 11, 17)>.
- For node 12: <12, (6, 1, 16)>.
- For node 13: <13, (15, 1, 9)>.
- For node 14: <14, (15, 7, 2)>.
- For node 17: <17, (19, 7, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
