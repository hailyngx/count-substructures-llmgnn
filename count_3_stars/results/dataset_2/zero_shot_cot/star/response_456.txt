Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 3) (18, 16) (18, 5) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 14) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 19) (9, 12) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 19) (12, 4) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 5) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 19) (2, 3) (0, 15) (0, 6) (0, 19) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 15) (5, 3) (5, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

The nodes that are directly connected to each node are as follows:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 1, 19, and 17
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 18
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 13
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4 and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 3
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 16 and 5
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 14
- Node 17 is connected to node 11
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8, 15, and 3
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 0, and 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 19
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 16, 4, and 19
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4 and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 0
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 11, 9, 13, and 2
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 10, 2, and 5
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1 and 10
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 19 and 3
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 15, 6, 19, and 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 18, 15, 3, and 0

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<11, (16, 1, 17)>
<16, (11, 13, 18)>
<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<7, (4, 9, 12)>
<8, (9, 10, 3)>
<18, (16, 5, -)>
<1, (11, 6, 14)>
<10, (8, 15, 3)>
<15, (10, 0, 5)>
<9, (7, 8, 19)>
<13, (16, 4, 19)>
<12, (4, 9, -)>
<6, (1, 0, -)>
<19, (11, 9, 13)>
<3, (8, 10, 2)>
<14, (1, 10, -)>
<2, (19, 3, -)>
<0, (15, 6, 19)>
<5, (18, 15, 3)>

Counting these, we have a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
