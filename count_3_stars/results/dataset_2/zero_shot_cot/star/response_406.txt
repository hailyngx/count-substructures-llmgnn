Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

In this graph, we can find the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 5, 3)>
<4, (8, 13, 14)>
<7, (12, 0, 14)>
<8, (4, 2, 14)>
<12, (6, 7, 14)>
<2, (8, 1, 10)>
<0, (7, 11, 1)>
<14, (9, 4, 12)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<3, (6, 5, 11)>
<11, (8, 2, 0)>
<1, (9, 2, 0)>
<13, (4, 0, 14)>
<10, (8, 2, 5)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
