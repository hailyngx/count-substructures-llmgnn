Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 18) (17, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 19) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 17) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 18) (0, 5) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 18) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 16) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 3) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star in this graph can be any node with exactly three neighbors. Let's find those nodes first:

Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 6, 9, 1, 13, 12, 15, 0

Now, let's find the 3-stars using the central nodes we found:

<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 18, 7)>
<1, (6, 13, 5)>
<13, (4, 1, 14)>
<12, (6, 1, 15)>
<15, (14, 16, 12)>
<0, (5, 11, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [7]
