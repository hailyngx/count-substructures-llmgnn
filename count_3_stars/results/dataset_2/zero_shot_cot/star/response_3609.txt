Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 6) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 10) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 7) (5, 17) (5, 4) (12, 14) (12, 10) (1, 16) (1, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 13) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Node 3: (3, 11, 0) and (3, 15, 2) and (3, 7, 9)
2. Node 14: (14, 17, 7) and (14, 12, 4)
3. Node 16: (16, 1, 18)
4. Node 9: (9, 2, 18) and (9, 10, 4)

Therefore, we have a total of <3, (11, 0, 15), 14, (17, 7, 12), 16, (1, 18), 9, (2, 18, 10)> 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
