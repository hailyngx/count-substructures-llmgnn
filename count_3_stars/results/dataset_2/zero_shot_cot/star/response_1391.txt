Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13
Node 1: 0, 4, 8, 13
Node 2: 7, 10, 13, 14
Node 3: 4, 5
Node 4: 1, 3, 8, 11
Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 9
Node 6: 0, 12, 14
Node 7: 2, 5, 9, 12
Node 8: 1, 4, 9, 10, 11
Node 9: 5, 7, 8, 12, 14
Node 10: 0, 2, 8
Node 11: 4, 8, 13
Node 12: 0, 6, 7, 9, 13
Node 13: 0, 1, 2, 11, 12
Node 14: 2, 6, 9

Now, let's look for 3-stars. 

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 13)>
<0, (1, 6, 13)>
<0, (5, 6, 12)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 13)>
<1, (4, 8, 11)>
<2, (7, 9, 14)>
<4, (1, 8, 11)>
<4, (3, 8, 11)>
<7, (2, 9, 14)>
<8, (1, 4, 11)>
<8, (4, 9, 11)>
<9, (5, 7, 12)>
<9, (7, 8, 12)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of 15 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
