Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 18) (4, 0) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 15) (9, 1) (9, 18) (18, 7) (18, 9) (6, 11) (6, 19) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 16) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 16) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 12) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 19) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars.

Nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 10: (10, 3), (10, 17), (10, 12), (10, 2)
- Node 17: (17, 10), (17, 11), (17, 7)
- Node 2: (2, 10), (2, 8), (2, 11)
- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 16), (8, 11)
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 12), (4, 15)
- Node 12: (12, 10), (12, 4), (12, 14), (12, 15)
- Node 14: (14, 12), (14, 19), (14, 16)
- Node 6: (6, 11), (6, 19)
- Node 19: (19, 6), (19, 14), (19, 16)
- Node 15: (15, 5), (15, 0), (15, 4), (15, 12)
- Node 16: (16, 8), (16, 14), (16, 19)
- Node 11: (11, 17), (11, 2), (11, 8), (11, 13), (11, 6)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:
- 3-stars with center at node 10: <10, (3, 17, 12)>, <10, (3, 17, 2)>
- 3-stars with center at node 17: <17, (10, 11, 7)>
- 3-stars with center at node 2: <2, (10, 8, 11)>
- 3-stars with center at node 8: <8, (2, 16, 11)>
- 3-stars with center at node 4: <4, (0, 12, 15)>
- 3-stars with center at node 12: <12, (10, 4, 14)>, <12, (4, 15, 12)>
- 3-stars with center at node 14: <14, (12, 19, 16)>, <14, (19, 16, 14)>
- 3-stars with center at node 6: <6, (11, 19, 6)>
- 3-stars with center at node 19: <19, (14, 16, 19)>
- 3-stars with center at node 15: <15, (5, 0, 4)>, <15, (0, 4, 15)>, <15, (5, 12, 15)>, <15, (0, 12, 15)>
- 3-stars with center at node 16: <16, (8, 14, 19)>
- 3-stars with center at node 11: <11, (17, 2, 8)>, <11, (2, 8, 11)>, <11, (17, 8, 11)>, <11, (17, 13, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
