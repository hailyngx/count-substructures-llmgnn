Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in each potential 3-star:

1. Node 4 has connections with nodes 7, 0, 10, 1, and 3.
2. Node 7 has connections with nodes 4, 6, and 1.
3. Node 6 has connections with nodes 7, 2, 11, and 8.
4. Node 9 has connections with nodes 2 and 13.
5. Node 8 has connections with nodes 6, 13, and 10.
6. Node 13 has connections with nodes 9, 8, 12, 10, 14, and 0.
7. Node 2 has connections with nodes 6, 9, 12, 5, and 3.
8. Node 12 has connections with nodes 13, 2, 0, and 3.
9. Node 11 has connections with nodes 6, 14, and 0.
10. Node 14 has connections with nodes 13, 11, 1, and 5.
11. Node 0 has connections with nodes 4, 13, 12, 11, and 3.
12. Node 3 has connections with nodes 4, 2, 12, 0, and 5.
13. Node 5 has connections with nodes 2, 14, and 3.
14. Node 1 has connections with nodes 4, 7, 12, and 14.
15. Node 10 has connections with nodes 4, 8, and 13.

In a 3-star, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the connections listed above, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:

<4, (7, 0, 10)>
<6, (7, 2, 8)>
<13, (9, 8, 14)>
<2, (6, 9, 12)>
<12, (13, 0, 3)>
<11, (6, 14, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
