Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (13, 0) (22, 12) (11, 19) (11, 29) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 8) (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 15) (26, 27) (26, 4) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 29) (21, 16) (21, 7) (21, 28) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 6) (25, 20) (25, 8) (12, 22) (12, 10) (12, 17) (27, 9) (27, 26) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 17) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 1) (28, 5) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 23) (3, 14) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 24) (19, 1) (4, 26) (4, 2) (15, 26) (15, 19) (15, 24) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (5, 28) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 19) (24, 15) (29, 11) (29, 7) (29, 23) (1, 20) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 2) (1, 10) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 1) (23, 14) (23, 29) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with the degree of 3, as they have the potential to be the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

Nodes with degree 3: 0, 1, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 23, 28, 29

Next, let's list out all the possible 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (13, 7, 14)>
<1, (20, 19, 2)>
<8, (16, 25, 17)>
<10, (13, 9, 12)>
<12, (22, 10, 17)>
<14, (0, 3, 23)>
<15, (26, 19, 24)>
<16, (21, 24, 8)>
<17, (20, 12, 6)>
<20, (25, 17, 1)>
<21, (16, 7, 28)>
<23, (14, 29, 3)>
<28, (21, 6, 1)>
<29, (11, 23, 7)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars listed: [13].
