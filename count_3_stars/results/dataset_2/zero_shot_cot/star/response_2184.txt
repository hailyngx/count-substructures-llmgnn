Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 17) (4, 11) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 16) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 1) (13, 11) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (16, 4) (3, 18) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 14) (1, 19) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (15, 12) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in a star-like structure. 

Starting from the first node, we can count the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 4, connected to nodes 11, 14, and 16.
2. Node 5, connected to nodes 0, 8, and 10.
3. Node 7, connected to nodes 3, 9, and 18.
4. Node 10, connected to nodes 2, 5, and 11.
5. Node 12, connected to nodes 3, 15, and 17.
6. Node 13, connected to nodes 11, 17, and 19.
7. Node 14, connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.
8. Node 17, connected to nodes 11, 13, and 3.
9. Node 18, connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
10. Node 19, connected to nodes 1, 2, and 13.

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <4, (11, 14, 16)>, <5, (0, 8, 10)>, <7, (3, 9, 18)>, <10, (2, 5, 11)>, <12, (3, 15, 17)>, <13, (11, 17, 19)>, <14, (2, 4, 8)>, <17, (11, 13, 3)>, <18, (3, 4, 7)>, and <19, (1, 2, 13)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
