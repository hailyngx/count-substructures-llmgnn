Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 19) (7, 4) (7, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (10, 17) (10, 1) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 19) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 18) (3, 8) (11, 17) (11, 8) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 14) (15, 0) (15, 5) (13, 6) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 15) (0, 12) (16, 6) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 15) (5, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 18) (14, 5) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-star structure in the graph:

1. (4, 7, 5) - 3-star with node 4 as the center and nodes 7, 5 as the leaves.
2. (2, 9, 8) - 3-star with node 2 as the center and nodes 9, 8 as the leaves.
3. (17, 10, 1) - 3-star with node 17 as the center and nodes 10, 1 as the leaves.
4. (17, 13, 14) - 3-star with node 17 as the center and nodes 13, 14 as the leaves.
5. (12, 18, 0) - 3-star with node 12 as the center and nodes 18, 0 as the leaves.

Counting the unique 3-stars identified, we have found 5 unique 3-stars. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5]. 

<4, (7, 5)>, <2, (9, 8)>, <17, (10, 1)>, <17, (13, 14)>, <12, (18, 0)>
