Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 23) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 5) (17, 14) (3, 11) (3, 27) (3, 22) (25, 14) (25, 0) (25, 28) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 1) (27, 3) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 19) (10, 15) (10, 13) (28, 9) (28, 14) (28, 25) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 6) (29, 11) (6, 29) (6, 1) (6, 18) (2, 8) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 18) (22, 26) (22, 3) (22, 5) (24, 26) (24, 13) (11, 3) (11, 29) (11, 13) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 5) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 10) (13, 24) (13, 11) (13, 5) (0, 25) (0, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (19, 27) (19, 7) (19, 4) (23, 26) (23, 7) (23, 20) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 19) (20, 23) (20, 21) (21, 20) (18, 27) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star. We will find the nodes that have exactly three neighbors.

Nodes with exactly three neighbors: 1, 29, 10, 8, 17, 8, 24, 20, 21

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (6, 15, 5)>
<6, (29, 11, 1)>
<8, (0, 2, 15)>
<17, (14, 28, 25)>
<10, (15, 13, 2)>
<24, (13, 26, 16)>
<20, (23, 21, 4)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[6]
