Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's go through the graph step-by-step:

1. Start with node 0.

   - Node 1 has neighbors: 29 and 8.
   - There are no 3-stars with node 1 as the center.

3. Continue to node 2.
   - Node 2 has neighbors: 3.
   - There is a 3-star: <2, (3, 6, 22)>.

    - There are no 3-stars with node 21 as the center.

23. Look at node 22.
    - Node 22 has neighbors: 16, 21, 6.
    - There is a 3-star: <22, (6, 2, 16)>.

24. Continue to node 23.
    - Node 23 has neighbors: 0, 15, 28, and 4.
    - There are no 3-stars with node 23 as the center.

25. Analyze node 24.
    - Node 24 has neighbors: 7, 21, 10, 8, and 25.
    - There are no 3-stars with node 24 as the center.

26. Check node 25.
    - Node 25 has neighbors: 24.
    - There are no 3-stars with node 25 as the center.

27. Look at node 26.
    - Node 26 has neighbors: 29, 18, 27.
    - There are no 3-stars with node 26 as the center.

28. Continue to node 27.

The unique 3-stars found in the given graph are:
<2, (3, 6, 22)>, <22, (6, 16, 2)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
