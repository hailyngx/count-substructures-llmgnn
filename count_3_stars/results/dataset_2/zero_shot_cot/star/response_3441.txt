Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three neighbors, as these nodes could potentially be the central nodes of 3-stars. 

The nodes with exactly three neighbors are:  
- Node 0: {8, 12, 10}
- Node 2: {5, 11, 13}
- Node 5: {13, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {4, 10, 3}
- Node 11: {8, 2, 0}

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (8, 12, 10)>
- <2, (5, 11, 13)>
- <5, (13, 2, 4)>
- <9, (4, 10, 3)>

Therefore, there are [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
