Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 7) (22, 13) (22, 15) (22, 20) (7, 13) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 15) (0, 20) (0, 2) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 3) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 29) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 26) (29, 6) (29, 17) (29, 19) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 19) (28, 8) (28, 15) (3, 20) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 14) (8, 28) (8, 15) (9, 25) (23, 11) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 24) (16, 7) (16, 24) (4, 13) (4, 23) (4, 10) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 27) (12, 2) (24, 11) (24, 23) (24, 16) (24, 19) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 24) (19, 1) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 23) (1, 19) (1, 25) (26, 20) (26, 17) (26, 2) (26, 27) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 10) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 17) (10, 4) (10, 25) (10, 27) (27, 2) (27, 26) (27, 10) (15, 22) (15, 21) (15, 28) (15, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<13, (22, 4, 7)>
<22, (13, 15, 20)>
<7, (13, 21, 16)>
<21, (7, 15, 0)>
<0, (20, 2, 21)>
<20, (22, 0, 26)>
<3, (20, 5, 11)>
<5, (6, 18, 3)>
<6, (5, 14, 29)>
<17, (29, 18, 26)>
<29, (6, 17, 19)>
<11, (3, 23, 24)>
<28, (8, 15, 21)>
<8, (28, 15, 16)>
<9, (25, 1, 10)>
<23, (11, 4, 14)>
<16, (7, 24, 18)>
<4, (13, 23, 10)>
<2, (0, 12, 26)>
<12, (2, 27, 0)>
<19, (29, 24, 1)>
<1, (19, 25, 9)>
<14, (6, 3, 23)>
<26, (20, 17, 2)>
<25, (9, 1, 10)>
<18, (7, 5, 17)>
<10, (4, 27, 25)>
<27, (2, 26, 10)>
<15, (22, 21, 28)>

There are a total of [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
