Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. A 3-star consists of one central node connected to three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 9, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 6)>
<6, (4, 1, 3)>
<0, (6, 2, 9)>
<2, (4, 3, 6)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [10]
