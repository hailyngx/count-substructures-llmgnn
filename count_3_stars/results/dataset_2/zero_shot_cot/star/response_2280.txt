Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be determined by counting how many nodes could be the central node and for each central node, counting how many 3-stars can be formed.  

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Node 5: (5, 0, 3, 6) [4 unique 3-stars]
2. Node 9: (9, 1, 8, 5) [4 unique 3-stars]
3. Node 4: (4, 0, 3, 7) [4 unique 3-stars]
4. Node 7: (7, 2, 4, 6) [4 unique 3-stars]
5. Node 1: (1, 3, 8, 9) [4 unique 3-stars]
6. Node 3: (3, 1, 2, 4) [4 unique 3-stars]
7. Node 8: (8, 1, 2, 9) [4 unique 3-stars]
8. Node 6: (6, 0, 5, 7) [4 unique 3-stars]
9. Node 2: (2, 3, 4, 7) [4 unique 3-stars]
10. Node 0: (0, 2, 4, 5) [4 unique 3-stars]

Adding the number of unique 3-stars for each node, there are a total of 10 * 4 = 40 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [40].
