Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 15) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 1) (12, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 14) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 19) (2, 19) (2, 14) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 9) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 16) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 2) (10, 4) (18, 0) (0, 1) (0, 18)
