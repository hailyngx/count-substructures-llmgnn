Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, we can identify all nodes that are directly connected to the node 5, which will give us the leaves of potential 3-stars.

Nodes directly connected to node 5: 0, 6, 8

Next, we can check these neighbor nodes to see if they form 3-stars with node 5 as the center. To form a 3-star:
- The center node (5) must be connected to exactly three leaves.
- Each leaf must not be connected to any other node.

Checking the nodes directly connected to node 5 (0, 6, 8):
- Node 0 has connections to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 2, violating the 3-star condition.
- Node 6 has connections to nodes 5, 4, 8, and 0, violating the 3-star condition.
- Node 8 has connections to nodes 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 3, violating the 3-star condition.

Thus, there are 0 3-stars in the given graph.
