This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 19) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 6) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 19) (2, 19) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 14) (12, 1) (4, 15) (4, 18) (4, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 17) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 1) (0, 3) (0, 19) (0, 6) (19, 15) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 0) (14, 16) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 4) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
There are <1, (7, 12, 17)>, <4, (12, 14, 18)>, <6, (0, 10, 16)>, <9, (5, 13, 19)>.
