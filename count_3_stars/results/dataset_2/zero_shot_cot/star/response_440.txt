Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 16) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 19) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 17) (6, 7) (9, 18) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 16) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 16) (13, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (19, 1) (19, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 15) (12, 8) (12, 4) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 0) 

Response:
The process of counting the number of 3-stars involves counting the number of occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three nodes. Let's go through each node:

Node 0: (1, 11, 5), (8, 15)
Node 1: (0, 3, 19), (13, 14, 17)
Node 2: (4, 7, 18)
Node 3: (1, 11, 19)
Node 4: (2, 5, 12), (15)
Node 5: (0, 4, 7), (11, 15)
Node 6: (7, 17, 18)
Node 7: (2, 5, 6)
Node 8: (0, 12, 15)
Node 9: (18)
Node 10: (11)
Node 11: (0, 3, 5), (10)
Node 12: (4, 8)
Node 13: (1, 14, 16), (15)
Node 14: (1, 13, 16)
Node 15: (0, 4, 8), (13)
Node 16: (13, 14, 18)
Node 17: (6, 7, 15)
Node 18: (2, 6, 16), (9)
Node 19: (1, 3)

So, counting the occurrences, we find a total of 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph: 
<0, (1, 11, 5)>, <0, (8, 15)>, <1, (0, 3, 19)>, <1, (13, 14, 17)>, <4, (2, 5, 12)>, <4, (15)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (11, 15)>, <6, (7, 17, 18)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 12, 15)>, <11, (0, 3, 5)>, <13, (1, 14, 16)>, <13, (15)>.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
