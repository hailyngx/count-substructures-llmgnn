Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 15) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 17) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 8) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (15, 16) (15, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 10) (17, 7) (17, 3) (19, 11) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 12) (14, 16) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 19) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 8) (8, 6) (8, 18) (8, 3) (8, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: {9, 10}
- Node 1: {10, 13}
- Node 2: {15, 16}
- Node 3: {11, 13, 17, 19}
- Node 4: {14}
- Node 5: {7, 10}
- Node 6: {7, 8, 9, 11}
- Node 7: {5, 6, 17}
- Node 8: {6, 12, 18, 3}
- Node 9: {0, 6, 12}
- Node 10: {0, 1, 5, 18}
- Node 11: {3, 6, 19}
- Node 12: {8, 9, 14, 19}
- Node 13: {1, 3, 19}
- Node 14: {4, 12, 16, 18}
- Node 15: {2}
- Node 16: {14, 15}
- Node 17: {3, 5}
- Node 18: {8, 10, 14}
- Node 19: {3, 11, 12, 13}

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 10, 5)>
- <1, (10, 13, 3)>
- <2, (15, 16, 14)>
- <3, (11, 13, 19)>
- <4, (14, 12, 16)>
- <5, (7, 10, 5)>
- <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (7, 6, 11)>
- <8, (6, 12, 18)>
- <12, (8, 9, 14)>
- <13, (1, 3, 19)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10.]
