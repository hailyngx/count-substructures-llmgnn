Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (1, 7, 6)>
2. <9, (1, 8, 2)>
3. <4, (1, 7, 8)>
4. <7, (5, 1, 4)>
5. <1, (5, 9, 4)>
6. <3, (1, 6, 0)>
7. <8, (9, 4, 3)>
8. <6, (5, 1, 3)>
9. <0, (4, 7, 3)>
10. <2, (9, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
