Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<0, (1, 7, 2)>
<0, (1, 7, 5)>
<2, (3, 8, 6)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
