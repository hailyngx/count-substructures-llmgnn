Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 12) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 14) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 10: <1, (3, 5, 10)>
2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7: <3, (1, 5, 7)>
3. Node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 8: <10, (1, 0, 8)>
4. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 12, and 12: <4, (1, 12, 12)>
5. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 10: <5, (1, 3, 10)>
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 13: <6, (3, 5, 13)>
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 14: <7, (3, 11, 14)>
8. Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 0: <9, (11, 8, 0)>

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-star graphs in the given network.
