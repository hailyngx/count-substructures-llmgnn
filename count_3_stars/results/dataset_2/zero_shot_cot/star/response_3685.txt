Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 2) (17, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 5) (1, 17) (1, 9) (0, 4) (0, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (19, 7) (19, 5) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 8) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 6) (9, 15) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) (13, 2) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's start by going through each node in the graph and checking if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star has a center connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Nodes with three neighbors (forming a 3-star pattern):
- <4, (0, 13, 9)>
- <6, (2, 13, 8)>
- <7, (4, 17, 19)>
- <9, (1, 10, 15)>
- <13, (2, 4, 18)>
- <15, (3, 9, 12)>
- <16, (10, 8, 18)>

Now, we count the unique 3-stars found:
