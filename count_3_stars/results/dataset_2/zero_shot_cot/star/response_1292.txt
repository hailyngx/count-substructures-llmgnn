Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 17) (27, 26) (27, 13) (27, 6) (14, 17) (14, 9) (17, 27) (17, 14) (17, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 3) (22, 21) (10, 20) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 20) (0, 20) (0, 28) (20, 22) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 0) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 8) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 1) (1, 28) (1, 5) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 24) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 29) (8, 12) (8, 25) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 21) (4, 13) (4, 26) (4, 2) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 4) (16, 21) (16, 9) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 16) (21, 9) (24, 22) (24, 11) (24, 25) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 23) (2, 23) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 6) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 4) (26, 2) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 2) (29, 12) (29, 23) (9, 14) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 21) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <7, (12, 25, 26)>
2. <12, (7, 5, 29)>
3. <25, (7, 8, 24)>
4. <2, (4, 6, 23)>
5. <23, (11, 5, 2)>
6. <9, (14, 16, 21)>
7. <16, (9, 21, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
