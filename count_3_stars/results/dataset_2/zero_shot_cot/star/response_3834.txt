Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 14) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 5) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 7, 14)>
<12, (0, 6, 7)>
<3, (0, 11, 12)>
<11, (1, 9, 12)>
<1, (2, 9, 11)>
<6, (1, 12, 14)>
<14, (6, 8, 11)>
<0, (3, 4, 12)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 11)>
<10, (5, 13, 14)>
<5, (0, 7, 14)>
<13, (2, 10, 14)>

By listing all the unique 3-stars found above, we get a total of 15 3-stars. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
