Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 1) (12, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 6) (10, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 5, 13, and 14.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 9, 3, and 11.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 3, 7, and 6.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 9, 3, and 12.
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 5, 7, and 10.
- Node 13 has edges with nodes 8, 14, and 0.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- 3-stars with the center node as 0: <0, (5, 13, 14)> [1]
- 3-stars with the center node as 1: <1, (9, 3, 11)> [1]
- 3-stars with the center node as 2: <2, (3, 7, 6)> [1]
- 3-stars with the center node as 4: <4, (9, 3, 12)> [1]
- 3-stars with the center node as 6: <6, (5, 7, 10)> [1]
- 3-stars with the center node as 13: <13, (8, 14, 0)> [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
