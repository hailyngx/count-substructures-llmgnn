Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be found by examining each node as a potential center of a 3-star. We can do this by looking at each node and checking if it has exactly 3 neighboring nodes. Let's go through the graph step by step to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighboring nodes: 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 1 has 3 neighboring nodes: 0, 4, 5, but 1 is missing an edge
- Node 2 has 3 neighboring nodes: 0, 3, 6
- Node 3 has 4 neighboring nodes: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4 has 5 neighboring nodes: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5 has 4 neighboring nodes: 1, 4, 7, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighboring nodes: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7 has 4 neighboring nodes: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighboring nodes: 3, 5, 7
- Node 9 has 3 neighboring nodes: 3, 4, 7

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars below:

<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
