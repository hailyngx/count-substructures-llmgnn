Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (12, 10) (12, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 13) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Let's see which nodes can qualify as central nodes:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (13, 11, 4, 7).
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (6, 8, 11, 0).
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (5, 7, 14, 6).
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (5, 4, 3, 1).
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors (9, 4, 1, 14, 2, 13).
- Node 10 has 4 neighbors (11, 12, 8, 13).
- Node 13 has 5 neighbors (5, 6, 10, 11, 1).
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (7, 6, 12, 13).
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors (9, 11, 2, 8, 3).
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 3).

None of the nodes meet the criteria of being the center of a 3-star since they all have more than 3 connections.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
