Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 13) (5, 6) (28, 27) (28, 24) (28, 2) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 7) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 0) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 27) (17, 4) (20, 7) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 10) (3, 20) (3, 21) (3, 23) (3, 19) (3, 18) (21, 3) (21, 19) (16, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 25) (8, 26) (19, 3) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 15) (10, 20) (10, 29) (26, 8) (26, 7) (11, 24) (11, 18) (24, 28) (24, 11) (24, 23) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 12) (23, 20) (23, 3) (23, 24) (7, 22) (7, 20) (7, 26) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (2, 1) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 25) (27, 28) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 27) (13, 25) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 13) (25, 14) (12, 15) (18, 3) (18, 11) (4, 17) (4, 29) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node of a 3-star. We can do this by looking for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 6 has edges to 9, 5, and 2.
- Node 9 has edges to 6, 22, and 14.
- Node 2 has edges to 6, 28, and 1.
- Node 28 has edges to 6, 27, and 24.
- Node 17 has edges to 1, 8, and 27.
- Node 20 has edges to 7, 3, and 23.
- Node 3 has edges to 20, 21, and 19.
- Node 19 has edges to 3, 21, and 16.
- Node 8 has edges to 17, 19, and 25.
- Node 10 has edges to 20, 29, and 4.
- Node 26 has edges to 8, 7, and 25.
- Node 24 has edges to 28, 11, and 23.
- Node 15 has edges to 19, 14, and 12.
- Node 13 has edges to 9, 7, and 27.
- Node 25 has edges to 8, 0, and 13.

From the identified nodes, we can construct the 3-stars:
- <6, (9, 5, 2)>
- <9, (6, 22, 14)>
- <2, (6, 28, 1)>
- <28, (6, 27, 24)>
- <17, (1, 8, 27)>
- <20, (7, 3, 23)>
- <3, (20, 21, 19)>
- <19, (3, 21, 16)>
- <8, (17, 19, 25)>
- <10, (20, 29, 4)>
- <26, (8, 7, 25)>
- <24, (28, 11, 23)>
- <15, (19, 14, 12)>
- <13, (9, 7, 27)>
- <25, (8, 0, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
