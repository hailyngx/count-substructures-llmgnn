Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 0) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star graphs in the given graph. 
A 3-star graph consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find all possible 3-stars by checking each node as the potential center:

1. Potential 3-stars with center node 0:  
- <0, (3, 10, 12)>
- <0, (3, 8, 13)>

2. Potential 3-stars with center node 1:  
- <1, (4, 13, 14)>

3. Potential 3-stars with center node 2:  
- <2, (4, 8, 13)>
- <2, (4, 6, 10)>

4. Potential 3-stars with center node 3:  
- <3, (0, 5, 11)>
- <3, (0, 11, 12)>

5. Potential 3-stars with center node 4:  
- <4, (1, 13, 9)>
- <4, (1, 2, 13)>

6. Potential 3-stars with center node 5:  
- <5, (3, 6, 12)>
- <5, (3, 7, 11)>

7. Potential 3-stars with center node 6:  
- <6, (2, 5, 12)>
- <6, (2, 10, 12)>

8. Potential 3-stars with center node 7:  
- <7, (5, 11, 14)>

9. Potential 3-stars with center node 8:  
- <8, (0, 4, 13)>
- <8, (0, 11, 14)>

10. Potential 3-stars with center node 9:  
- <9, (4, 10, 13)>
- <9, (4, 8, 12)>

11. Potential 3-stars with center node 10:  
- <10, (2, 4, 9)>
- <10, (2, 0, 8)>

12. Potential 3-stars with center node 11:  
- <11, (3, 5, 7)>
- <11, (7, 8, 14)>

13. Potential 3-stars with center node 12:  
- <12, (0, 5, 6)>
- <12, (5, 9, 12)>

14. Potential 3-stars with center node 13:  
- <13, (0, 8, 14)>
- <13, (2, 4, 8)>

15. Potential 3-stars with center node 14:  
- <14, (1, 7, 13)>
- <14, (7, 8, 11)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we have a total of [28] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
