Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

There are <0, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 2, 8)>, <2, (9, 1, 3)>, <3, (9, 2, 8)>, <4, (6, 0, 2)>, <5, (7, 8, 2)>, <6, (8, 4, 6)>, <7, (9, 5, 8)>, <8, (6, 9, 7)>, <9, (6, 8, 7)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
