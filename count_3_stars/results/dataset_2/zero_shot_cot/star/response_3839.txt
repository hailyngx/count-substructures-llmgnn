Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the center of a 3-star. Since a 3-star has the center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with degree 3. 

Nodes with degree 3: 1, 5, 8, 14

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph based on the center nodes we identified. 

- For node 1: (1, 3, 10), (1, 3, 13)
- For node 5: (5, 3, 11)
- For node 8: (8, 0, 12), (8, 0, 14)
- For node 14: (14, 0, 10)

Counting the unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 10, 13)>, <5, (3, 11)>, <8, (0, 12, 14)>, <14, (0, 10)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
