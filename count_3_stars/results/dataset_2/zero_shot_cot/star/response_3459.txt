Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 11) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 12) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes with three edges are: 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, and 14. 

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph by checking each potential center node along with its neighbors. 

For node 0: No 3-stars can be formed because it is connected to only two other nodes.
For node 2: No 3-stars can be formed because it is connected to only four other nodes.
For node 6: No 3-stars can be formed because it is connected to only two other nodes.
For node 7: No 3-stars can be formed because it is connected to only four other nodes.
For node 8: No 3-stars can be formed because it is connected to only four other nodes.
For node 10: No 3-stars can be formed because it is connected to only four other nodes.
For node 12: No 3-stars can be formed because it is connected to only four other nodes.
For node 14: No 3-stars can be formed because it is connected to only four other nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
