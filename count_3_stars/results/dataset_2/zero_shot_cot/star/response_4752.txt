Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with 3 edges, as these nodes can potentially be the central nodes of 3-star graphs.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 9, 6, and 2)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 5, 9, and 1)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 6, 0, and there are only 2 edges present)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 7 and 2, but there are only 2 edges present)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 9, 6, and 8)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 5, 9, and 4)
- Node 2 (connected to nodes 5, 3, and 4)

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars based on the identified central nodes:
- For Node 5: (5, 9, 6), (5, 9, 2), (5, 6, 9), (5, 6, 2) - Total: 4
- For Node 9: (9, 5, 6), (9, 5, 8), (9, 6, 5), (9, 6, 8) - Total: 4
- For Node 6: (6, 5, 9), (6, 5, 1), (6, 9, 5), (6, 9, 1) - Total: 4
- For Node 4: (4, 9, 6), (4, 9, 8), (4, 6, 9), (4, 6, 8) - Total: 4
- For Node 8: (8, 5, 9), (8, 5, 4), (8, 9, 5), (8, 9, 4) - Total: 4
- For Node 2: (2, 5, 3), (2, 5, 4), (2, 3, 5), (2, 3, 4) - Total: 4

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 3, 4)>
