Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 16) (13, 20) (22, 26) (22, 12) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (2, 16) (2, 20) (29, 16) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 19) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 24) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 27) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 18) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 28) (1, 19) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 10) (18, 8) (18, 27) (18, 6) (17, 3) (17, 11) (21, 28) (28, 1) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 24) (28, 23) (11, 17) (11, 19) (23, 28) (23, 25) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 20) (14, 10) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 29) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 0) (6, 18) (6, 24) (6, 25) (24, 5) (24, 28) (24, 6) (12, 22) (12, 5) (12, 0) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 28) (19, 11) (20, 13) (20, 2) (20, 9) (20, 14) (27, 3) (27, 9) (27, 18) (25, 23) (25, 6) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 0), (4, 5) -> <4, (7, 8, 0)>
2. Node 5: (5, 15), (5, 4), (5, 9), (5, 12), (5, 24) -> <5, (15, 4, 9)>
3. Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 18) -> <8, (4, 0, 1)>
4. Node 10: (10, 26), (10, 14), (10, 0) -> <10, (26, 14, 0)>
5. Node 12: (12, 22), (12, 5), (12, 0) -> <12, (22, 5, 0)>
6. Node 14: (14, 1), (14, 26), (14, 20), (14, 10) -> <14, (1, 26, 20)>
7. Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 9), (15, 5) -> <15, (3, 9, 5)>
8. Node 16: (16, 13), (16, 2), (16, 29) -> <16, (13, 2, 29)>
9. Node 18: (18, 8), (18, 27), (18, 6) -> <18, (8, 27, 6)>
10. Node 19: (19, 7), (19, 1), (19, 28), (19, 11) -> <19, (7, 1, 28)>
11. Node 20: (20, 13), (20, 2), (20, 9), (20, 14) -> <20, (13, 2, 9)>
12. Node 22: (22, 26), (22, 12) -> <22, (26, 12)>
13. Node 24: (24, 5), (24, 28), (24, 6) -> <24, (5, 28, 6)>
14. Node 26: (26, 22), (26, 14), (26, 10) -> <26, (22, 14, 10)>
15. Node 28: (28, 1), (28, 21), (28, 19), (28, 24), (28, 23) -> <28, (1, 21, 19)>

There are a total of 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
