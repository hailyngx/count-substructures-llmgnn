Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 15) (4, 18) (4, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 14) (12, 1) (12, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 3) (14, 16) (14, 15) (14, 13) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 15) (0, 13) (15, 11) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 0) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 14) (13, 0) (9, 11) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, indicating the center of the 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly three connected edges:
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 12)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 14), (3, 2)
- Node 10: (10, 12), (10, 18), (10, 19)
- Node 11: (11, 9), (11, 15)
- Node 4: (4, 18), (4, 13)
- Node 8: (8, 2), (8, 6), (8, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 0)
- Node 19: (19, 10), (19, 18), (19, 13), (19, 0)
- Node 7: (7, 8), (7, 2), (7, 18), (7, 16)
- Node 16: (16, 7), (16, 14)
- Node 12: (12, 1), (12, 10)
- Node 6: (6, 8), (6, 18), (6, 17)
- Node 17: (17, 6), (17, 15)
- Node 14: (14, 3), (14, 16), (14, 15), (14, 13)
- Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 19), (0, 15), (0, 13)

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars by identifying the combinations of center nodes and their connected nodes:

<1, (3, 12)>
<3, (1, 14, 2)>
<10, (12, 18, 19)>
<4, (18, 13)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 0)>
<19, (10, 18, 13, 0)>
<7, (8, 2, 18, 16)>
<16, (7, 14)>
<12, (1, 10)>
<6, (8, 18, 17)>
<17, (6, 15)>
<14, (3, 16, 15, 13)>
<0, (5, 19, 15, 13)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
