Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 6) (22, 27) (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 25) (3, 28) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 20) (25, 16) (25, 12) (25, 4) (25, 21) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 10) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 20) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 24) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 15) (29, 0) (29, 15) (29, 4) (19, 13) (19, 26) (26, 19) (9, 13) (9, 12) (28, 3) (28, 27) (10, 3) (10, 23) (10, 21) (10, 7) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 15) (21, 4) (18, 8) (18, 20) (1, 6) (1, 2) (24, 14) (24, 17) (20, 3) (20, 6) (20, 18) (20, 27) (2, 11) (2, 1) (15, 23) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 21) (27, 22) (27, 28) (27, 20) (27, 7) (12, 25) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 27) (4, 25) (4, 5) (4, 29) (4, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (14, 20, 10)>
<17, (24, 15, 16)>
<21, (10, 4, 15)>
<5, (6, 11, 4)>
<8, (14, 0, 23)>
<27, (28, 7, 20)>
<25, (21, 4, 16)>
<16, (17, 25, 11)>
<29, (0, 4, 15)>
<6, (1, 5, 12)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [10].
