Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 5) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 16) (13, 16) (13, 18) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 2) (5, 15) (5, 8) (6, 12) (6, 19) (11, 14) (11, 7) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 8) (16, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 0) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 10) 

Response:
We can start by identifying the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, which will form the centers of the 3-stars. Then we can find the unique 3-stars by looking at the connections of these central nodes. 

The nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them are: 2, 4, 7, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

Now let's find the 3-stars:

<2, (0, 8, 12)>
<4, (1, 14, 17)>
<7, (0, 4, 11)>
<12, (2, 3, 6)>
<14, (4, 11, 17)>
<15, (1, 5, 9)>
<16, (8, 13, 6)>
<17, (4, 14, 19)>
<18, (2, 13, 14)>
<19, (0, 6, 17)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are 10 of them. 
Therefore, the final answer is [10].
