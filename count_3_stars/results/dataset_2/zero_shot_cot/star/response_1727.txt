Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
1. Node 0 is connected to 1, 2, 3, and 6.
2. Node 1 is connected to 0, 5, 8, and 9.
3. Node 2 is connected to 0, 6, and 9.
4. Node 3 is connected to 0, 4, 7, and 8.
5. Node 4 is connected to 3, 5, 6, and 7.
6. Node 5 is connected to 1, 4, and 7.
7. Node 6 is connected to 0, 2, 4, and 9.
8. Node 7 is connected to 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.
9. Node 8 is connected to 1, 3, 7, and 9.
10. Node 9 is connected to 1, 6, 7, and 8.

Next, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (0, 2, 4)>
- <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (2, 6, 7)>

Finally, count the number of unique 3-stars: 9
