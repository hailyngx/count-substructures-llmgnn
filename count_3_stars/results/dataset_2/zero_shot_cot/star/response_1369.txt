Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 2.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 0.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 8.

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 6: <6, (9, 5, 7)> and <6, (9, 3, 7)>.
- There are 4 3-stars centered at node 9: <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (6, 5, 7)>, and <9, (4, 1, 7)>.
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 1: <1, (9, 3, 2)> and <1, (9, 4, 7)>.
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 3: <3, (6, 1, 7)> and <3, (6, 5, 8)>.
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 4: <4, (9, 1, 7)> and <4, (9, 6, 5)>.
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 7: <7, (6, 9, 1)> and <7, (6, 3, 4)>.
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 5: <5, (6, 3, 8)> and <5, (6, 9, 7)>.
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 2: <2, (9, 1, 8)> and <2, (9, 0, 5)>.
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 8: <8, (2, 5, 0)> and <8, (2, 5, 0)>.
- There are 2 3-stars centered at node 0: <0, (5, 2, 8)> and <0, (5, 2, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20], and the unique 3-stars are <6, (9, 5, 7)>, <6, (9, 3, 7)>, <9, (6, 4, 2)>, <9, (6, 1, 7)>, <9, (4, 1, 7)>, <1, (9, 3, 2)>, <1, (9, 4, 7)>, <3, (6, 1, 7)>, <3, (6, 5, 8)>, <4, (9, 1, 7)>, <4, (9, 6, 5)>, <7, (6, 9, 1)>, <7, (6, 3, 4)>, <5, (6, 3, 8)>, <5, (6, 9, 7)>, <2, (9, 1, 8)>, <2, (9, 0, 5)>, <8, (2, 5, 0)>, <0, (5, 2, 8)>.
