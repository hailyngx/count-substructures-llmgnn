Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 20) (17, 16) (17, 19) (3, 9) (3, 29) (25, 5) (25, 26) (25, 4) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 21) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 11) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 4) (29, 10) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 20) (7, 23) (15, 4) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 21) (20, 14) (20, 7) (20, 15) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 12) (28, 6) (28, 16) (19, 17) (19, 29) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 23) (16, 17) (16, 28) (16, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 27) (9, 12) (10, 29) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 11) (24, 0) (24, 18) (24, 5) (23, 7) (23, 26) (23, 1) (23, 0) (11, 2) (11, 21) (11, 18) (18, 9) (18, 24) (18, 11) (5, 25) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 22) (1, 16) (1, 23) (1, 0) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 23) (0, 1) (0, 12) (27, 19) (27, 9) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (22, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes can be the center of a 3-star in this graph:
- Node 0 has 4 edges (13, 24, 23, 1).
- Node 4 has 3 edges (25, 29, 15).
- Node 5 has 3 edges (25, 2, 24).
- Node 6 has 3 edges (20, 28, 12).
- Node 8 has 4 edges (13, 9, 21, 26).
- Node 9 has 5 edges (3, 8, 18, 27, 12).
- Node 15 has 4 edges (4, 20, 26, 21).
- Node 16 has 3 edges (17, 28, 1).
- Node 19 has 4 edges (17, 29, 26, 27).
- Node 20 has 4 edges (14, 7, 15, 6).
- Node 23 has 4 edges (7, 26, 1, 0).
- Node 25 has 3 edges (5, 26, 4).
- Node 29 has 4 edges (3, 19, 4, 10).

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (13, 24, 23)>
- <4, (25, 29, 15)>
- <5, (25, 2, 24)>
- <6, (20, 28, 12)>
- <8, (13, 9, 21)>
- <9, (3, 8, 18)>
- <15, (4, 20, 26)>
- <16, (17, 28, 1)>
- <19, (17, 29, 26)>
- <20, (14, 7, 6)>
- <23, (7, 26, 1)>
- <25, (5, 26, 4)>
- <29, (3, 19, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
