Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 15) (17, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 19) (7, 18) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 18) (8, 19) (8, 0) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 8) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 18) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 12) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 13) (4, 0) (4, 13) (15, 9) (15, 14) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 4) (18, 7) (18, 6) (18, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node (center) and its connected nodes (leaves).

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Central Node with 3 Leaves:
- (9, 11, 17)
- (12, 2, 6) 
- (0, 1, 8)
- (16, 13, 18)

Now, we can see that we have identified all possible 3-stars in the graph. Let's count them.

There are a total of [**4**] 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [**4**].

Unique 3-stars: <9, (11, 17)>, <12, (2, 6)>, <0, (1, 8)>, <16, (13, 18)>.
