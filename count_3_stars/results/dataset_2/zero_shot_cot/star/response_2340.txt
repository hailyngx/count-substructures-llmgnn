Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars based on the edges provided:

1. <1, (5, 9, 7)>
2. <2, (5, 4, 1)>
3. <3, (5, 4, 7)>
4. <6, (9, 1, 7)>
5. <8, (5, 3, 9)>
6. <0, (7, 1, 5)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
