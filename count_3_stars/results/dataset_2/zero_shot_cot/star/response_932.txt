Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 22) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 11) (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 24) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 14) (18, 12) (18, 25) (22, 5) (22, 9) (22, 8) (15, 16) (15, 24) (20, 12) (4, 10) (28, 9) (28, 29) (28, 0) (28, 13) (17, 3) (17, 21) (17, 7) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 6) (16, 2) (16, 15) (16, 21) (16, 24) (16, 14) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 8) (6, 19) (6, 14) (23, 25) (23, 10) (26, 21) (26, 27) (26, 7) (21, 17) (21, 16) (21, 26) (21, 11) (21, 25) (0, 28) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 8) (24, 2) (24, 15) (24, 16) (11, 9) (11, 21) (14, 29) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 10) (27, 29) (27, 26) (12, 18) (12, 20) (12, 1) (13, 28) (25, 18) (25, 23) (25, 21) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 26) (7, 8) (10, 4) (10, 23) (10, 14) (8, 22) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are the center of a 3-star, meaning they have exactly three neighbors:
- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 19, 22
- Node 9 has neighbors 5, 22, 28
- Node 2 has neighbors 29, 16, 24
- Node 29 has neighbors 2, 28, 19
- Node 18 has neighbors 12, 25, 20
- Node 22 has neighbors 5, 9, 8
- Node 15 has neighbors 16, 24
- Node 20 has neighbors 12
- Node 4 has neighbors 10
- Node 1 has neighbors 19, 12, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors 19, 14
- Node 23 has neighbors 25, 10
- Node 26 has neighbors 21, 27, 7
- Node 0 has neighbors 28
- Node 3 has neighbors 5, 17, 8
- Node 24 has neighbors 2, 15, 16
- Node 11 has neighbors 9, 21
- Node 14 has neighbors 29, 16, 6
- Node 27 has neighbors 29, 26

Next, let's list out the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (9, 19, 22)>
<9, (5, 22, 28)>
<2, (29, 16, 24)>
<29, (2, 28, 19)>
<18, (12, 25, 20)>
<22, (5, 9, 8)>
<15, (16, 24, 15)>
<4, (10, 4, 0)>
<1, (19, 12, 8)>
<6, (19, 14, 6)>
<23, (25, 10, 23)>
<26, (21, 27, 7)>
<3, (5, 17, 8)>
<24, (2, 15, 16)>
<11, (9, 21, 11)>
<14, (29, 16, 6)>
<27, (29, 26, 7)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the graph, we get [16].
