Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 11) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 12) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 12) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph.

<6, (7, 5, 0)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>
<1, (7, 9, -)>
<3, (8, 4, 14)>
<5, (0, 8, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 13)>
<4, (3, 13, 9)>
<8, (9, 3, 5)>
<13, (7, 4, 11)>
<0, (6, 7, 5)>
<12, (8, 4, 10)>
<10, (2, 4, 12)>
<14, (3, 5, 12)>
<11, (2, 13, 4)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [14] 3-stars.
