Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 16) (1, 13) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 14) (18, 17) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 11) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 8) (19, 11) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 9) (0, 19) (0, 13) (11, 15) (11, 19) (5, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 19) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 0) (6, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (7, 12, 5)>
<5, (2, 3, 17)>
<7, (4, 9, 3)>
<8, (3, 10, 15)>
<9, (7, 10, 19)>
<10, (17, 9, 8)>
<12, (14, 3, 8)>
<13, (4, 1, 0)>
<14, (17, 18, 12)>
<15, (14, 10, 8)>
<16, (4, 1, 13)>
<17, (14, 5, 18)>
<18, (14, 17, 4)>
<19, (11, 6, 9)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [14].
