Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 15) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 5) (16, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential centers for 3-stars. 

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 7, 18, 3, 14, 16)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 18, 19, 12)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 11, 16)

Let's count the number of 3-stars for each potential center:

For node 4:
- <4, (7, 18, 3)> [1]
- <4, (7, 18, 14)> [2]
- <4, (7, 18, 16)> [3]
- <4, (7, 3, 14)> [4]
- <4, (7, 3, 16)> [5]
- <4, (7, 14, 16)> [6]
- <4, (18, 3, 14)> [7]
- <4, (18, 3, 16)> [8]
- <4, (18, 14, 16)> [9]
- <4, (3, 14, 16)> [10]
Total 3-stars for node 4: 10

For node 15:
- <15, (18, 19, 12)> [11]
Total 3-stars for node 15: 1

For node 5:
- <5, (11, 16, x)>
- We need to find the last leaf node connected to node 5.
- From the given edges, we can see that node 5 is connected to node 16, but there is no information about the third node connected to node 5. 
- Therefore, there are no 3-stars for node 5.

Final answer: [11]
