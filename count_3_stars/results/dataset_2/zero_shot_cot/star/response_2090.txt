Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 13) (5, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (14, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 11) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 11) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars in the graph. 

Nodes with 3 connections: 6, 9, 1, 5, 13, 7, 2, 12, 10, 4, 8

Now, we will check each of these nodes as potential centers for 3-stars and see if they are indeed connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

For node 6:
- (6, 5), (6, 14), and (6, 3) form a 3-star centered at 6. <6, (5, 14, 3)>

For node 9:
- (9, 4), (9, 3), and (9, 13) form a 3-star centered at 9. <9, (4, 3, 13)>

For node 1:
- (1, 3), (1, 5), and (1, 10) form a 3-star centered at 1. <1, (3, 5, 10)>

For node 5:
- (5, 6), (5, 1), and (5, 13) form a 3-star centered at 5. <5, (6, 1, 13)>

For node 13:
- (13, 9), (13, 5), and (13, 12) form a 3-star centered at 13. <13, (9, 5, 12)>

For node 7:
- (7, 0), (7, 13), and (7, 2) form a 3-star centered at 7. <7, (0, 13, 2)>

For node 2:
- (2, 13), (2, 7), and (2, 12) form a 3-star centered at 2. <2, (13, 7, 12)>

For node 12:
- (12, 6), (12, 9), and (12, 13) form a 3-star centered at 12. <12, (6, 9, 13)>

For node 10:
- (10, 1), (10, 0), and (10, 12) form a 3-star centered at 10. <10, (1, 0, 12)>

For node 4: 
- (4, 9), (4, 1), and (4, 5) form a 3-star centered at 4. <4, (9, 1, 5)>

For node 8: 
- (8, 3), (8, 0), and (8, 7) form a 3-star centered at 8. <8, (3, 0, 7)>

Thus, all the unique 3-stars in the graph are: 
<6, (5, 14, 3)>, <9, (4, 3, 13)>, <1, (3, 5, 10)>, <5, (6, 1, 13)>, <13, (9, 5, 12)>, <7, (0, 13, 2)>, <2, (13, 7, 12)>, <12, (6, 9, 13)>, <10, (1, 0, 12)>, <4, (9, 1, 5)>, <8, (3, 0, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
