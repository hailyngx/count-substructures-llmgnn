Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 14) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 8) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 15) (19, 5) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them, making them potential central nodes of 3-stars.
- Node 1 has edges connecting to nodes 3, 17, and 9.
- Node 3 has edges connecting to nodes 1, 14, and 5.
- Node 5 has edges connecting to nodes 3, 19, and 11.
- Node 7 has edges connecting to nodes 10, 18, and 13.
- Node 9 has edges connecting to nodes 1, 8, and 2.
- Node 13 has edges connecting to nodes 17, 7, and 9.
- Node 17 has edges connecting to nodes 1, 10, and 13.
- Node 18 has edges connecting to nodes 7, 16, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in this graph. 

- From node 1: <1, (3, 17, 9)>
- From node 3: <3, (1, 14, 5)>
- From node 5: <5, (3, 19, 11)>
- From node 7: <7, (10, 18, 13)>
- From node 9: <9, (1, 8, 2)>
- From node 13: <13, (17, 7, 9)>
- From node 17: <17, (1, 10, 13)>
- From node 18: <18, (7, 16, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
