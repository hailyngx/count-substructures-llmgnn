Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5: (1, 4, 6) 
2. Node 9: (1, 3, 5)
3. Node 4: (0, 5, 7) 
4. Node 7: (2, 3, 4)
5. Node 6: (0, 3, 5) 
6. Node 1: (3, 5, 9) 
7. Node 3: (1, 6, 9) 
8. Node 8: (0, 1, 3) 
9. Node 2: (0, 7, 8) 
10. Node 0: (2, 4, 6) 

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10] 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
