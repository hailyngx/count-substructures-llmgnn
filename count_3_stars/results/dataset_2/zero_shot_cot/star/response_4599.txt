Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 14) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star patterns in the graph based on the given edges:

1. From node 5: <5, (9, 7, 14)>
2. From node 9: <9, (5, 6, 8)>
3. From node 6: <6, (9, 7, 2)>
4. From node 10: <10, (11, 3, 8)>
5. From node 11: <11, (10, 14, 13)>
6. From node 8: <8, (9, 10, 1)>
7. From node 13: <13, (6, 11, 3)>
8. From node 7: <7, (5, 6, 12)>
9. From node 12: <12, (10, 11, 7)>
10. From node 4: <4, (11, 14, 1)>
11. From node 0: <0, (9, 6, 3)>
12. From node 14: <14, (5, 11, 12)>
13. From node 3: <3, (10, 13, 0)>
14. From node 1: <1, (10, 8, 4)>
15. From node 2: <2, (9, 6, 13)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique 3-star patterns:
