Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
The 3-stars in the given graph are:

<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (7, 6, 4)>
<8, (7, 5, 3)>
<8, (6, 4, 7)>
<8, (6, 9, 3)>
<8, (4, 1, 0)>
<8, (4, 9, 6)>
<8, (4, 0, 1)>
