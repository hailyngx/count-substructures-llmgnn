Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 13) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 14) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by considering each node as a potential center and counting the number of 3-stars with that node as the center.

To find all the 3-stars in the given graph, we will consider each node as the center in turn and find the adjacent nodes connected to it. Only nodes that are connected directly to the center node will be considered as leaves in the 3-star. 

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 0: <0, (11, 12, 13)>.
2. Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 8)>.
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 5, 12)>.
4. Node 3: <3, (1, 5, 14)>.
5. Node 4: <4, (5, 8, 13)>.
6. Node 5: <5, (3, 4, 7)>.
7. Node 6: <6, (5, 12, 13)>.
8. Node 7: <7, (0, 5, 8)>.
9. Node 8: <8, (1, 4, 7)>.
10. Node 9: <9, (7, 10, 14)>.
11. Node 10: <10, (8, 9, 11)>.
12. Node 11: <11, (0, 10, 13)>.
13. Node 12: <12, (0, 2, 14)>.
14. Node 13: <13, (0, 4, 7)>.
15. Node 14: <14, (3, 9, 12)>.

Hence, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
