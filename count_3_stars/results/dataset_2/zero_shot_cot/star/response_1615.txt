Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and 6. As node 2 is the center, these edges create the following 3-stars:
<2, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
<2, (4, 7, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (9, 4, 6)>
<2, (4, 7, 6)>
<2, (7, 1, 6)>

2. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 1, 3, 2, and 7. As node 4 is the center, these edges create the following 3-stars:
<4, (8, 1, 3)>
<4, (8, 1, 2)>
<4, (8, 3, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 2)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<4, (3, 2, 7)>

3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 6, and 2. As node 1 is the center, these edges create the following 3-stars:
<1, (9, 4, 7)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (4, 2, 6)>
<1, (7, 2, 6)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
