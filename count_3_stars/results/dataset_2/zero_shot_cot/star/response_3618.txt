Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 0) (18, 0) (18, 1) (22, 10) (8, 23) (8, 27) (8, 29) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 19) (14, 19) (14, 20) (14, 29) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 9) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 12) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 11) (28, 26) (28, 25) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 19) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 3) (25, 28) (25, 27) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 9) (20, 2) (29, 8) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 24) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 11) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 19) (12, 4) (12, 23) (12, 2) (27, 8) (27, 25) (27, 1) (2, 20) (2, 12) (10, 22) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 24) (1, 18) (1, 16) (1, 27) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 20) (5, 14) (5, 23) (5, 21) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 6) (21, 26) (21, 5) (21, 24) (24, 29) (24, 15) (24, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edge list, there are multiple 3-stars in the graph. Let's identify them one by one:

1. <4, (7, 26, 12)>
2. <7, (0, 4, 18)>
3. <0, (7, 18, 15)>
4. <18, (0, 1, 6)>
5. <22, (10, 26, 28)>
6. <8, (23, 27, 29)>
7. <13, (3, 15, 19)>
8. <14, (5, 19, 20)>
9. <17, (3, 6, 16)>
10. <23, (5, 8, 12)>
11. <26, (4, 11, 21)>
12. <28, (25, 26, 29)>
13. <20, (2, 9, 14)>
14. <29, (8, 14, 24)>
15. <3, (11, 13, 17)>
16. <11, (3, 19, 26)>
17. <12, (2, 4, 23)>
18. <27, (1, 8, 25)>
19. <10, (22, 26, 28)>
20. <15, (0, 13, 24)>
21. <1, (16, 18, 27)>
22. <6, (1, 6, 19)>
23. <9, (14, 17, 20)>
24. <5, (14, 21, 23)>
25. <19, (0, 6, 11)>
26. <21, (5, 24, 26)>
27. <24, (15, 21, 29)>

By counting the unique 3-stars identified above, we can see that there are [27] 3-stars in the given graph.
