Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:
<4, (7, 5, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

There are [4] 3-stars in total.
