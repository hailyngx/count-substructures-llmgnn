Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 5:
- 0, 3, 6, and 9

With this information, we can calculate the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by inspecting the connections with the central node 5:
1. Node 5: (0, 3, 6), so <5, (0, 3, 6)>
2. Node 5: (3, 6, 9), so <5, (3, 6, 9)>
3. Node 5: (0, 6, 9), so <5, (0, 6, 9)>

Thus, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
