Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (27, 0) (27, 1) (27, 19) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 16) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 18) (12, 16) (8, 0) (8, 14) (23, 26) (23, 2) (23, 25) (23, 1) (2, 23) (2, 14) (2, 11) (4, 0) (4, 18) (4, 24) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 28) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 15) (3, 11) (3, 29) (3, 19) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 3) (1, 27) (1, 17) (1, 23) (1, 7) (13, 9) (13, 26) (13, 28) (26, 10) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 21) (16, 6) (16, 12) (29, 3) (29, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 20) (21, 0) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 25) (28, 18) (28, 13) (20, 14) (20, 21) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 29) (7, 1) (7, 24) (24, 10) (24, 4) (24, 7) (25, 6) (25, 23) (25, 26) (25, 21) (19, 27) (19, 3) (15, 22) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as potential centers of the 3-stars. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three edges connected to them are: 0, 9, 26, 21, 25.

Next, we will look for all possible 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

For node 0:
- <0, (27, 21, 4)>
- <0, (27, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
- <9, (6, 22, 13)>
- <9, (6, 25, 16)>

For node 26:
- <26, (10, 23, 13)>
- <26, (10, 21, 25)>
- <26, (10, 5, 22)>
- <26, (23, 25, 21)>

For node 21:
- <21, (0, 26, 25)>
- <21, (0, 26, 20)>
- <21, (0, 25, 21)>
- <21, (26, 25, 20)>

For node 25:
- <25, (6, 26, 21)>
- <25, (6, 21, 20)>
- <25, (6, 23, 25)>
- <25, (26, 21, 20)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars found: 12
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
