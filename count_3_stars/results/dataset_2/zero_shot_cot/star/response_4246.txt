Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 23) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 15) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 29) (16, 26) (14, 22) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 4) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 15) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (3, 24) (3, 26) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 22) (15, 17) (15, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 20) (20, 0) (5, 11) (5, 6) (21, 25) (21, 24) (28, 7) (7, 28) (7, 29) (7, 27) (7, 26) (19, 22) (19, 2) (29, 16) (29, 7) (29, 26) (1, 14) (1, 24) (1, 27) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 19) (26, 16) (26, 3) (26, 7) (26, 29) (24, 3) (24, 21) (24, 1) (24, 12) (27, 9) (27, 7) (27, 1) (27, 8) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 25) (25, 13) (25, 21) (25, 4) (25, 23) (8, 27) (8, 12) (8, 18) (10, 4) (12, 24) (12, 8) (23, 13) (23, 25) (18, 6) (18, 3) (18, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, which can represent the center of a 3-star. Then we will list the unique 3-stars found in the graph.

Nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 20.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 8.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 16, 7, and 26.

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (11, 6, 20)>
<18, (6, 3, 8)>
<29, (16, 7, 26)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
