Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, we need to find the number of 3-stars.

Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 8, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (9, 0, 6)>
<6, (5, 8, 1)>
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (9, 8, 7)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find there are 10 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
