Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 5) (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 16) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 8) (0, 4) (0, 18) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 10) (1, 17) (1, 7) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 19) (17, 7) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 8) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 12) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 18) (8, 14) (8, 5) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 10) (7, 1) (7, 17) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 13) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- 3-star with center node 3: <3, (15, 9, 12)>
- 3-star with center node 6: <6, (9, 17, 12)>
- 3-star with center node 8: <8, (9, 18, 5)>
- 3-star with center node 9: <9, (16, 3, 6)>
- 3-star with center node 10: <10, (4, 14, 19)>
- 3-star with center node 12: <12, (3, 6, 13)>
- 3-star with center node 13: <13, (16, 4, 17)>
- 3-star with center node 14: <14, (8, 10, 19)>
- 3-star with center node 15: <15, (3, 18, 9)>
- 3-star with center node 16: <16, (13, 9, 5)>
- 3-star with center node 17: <17, (6, 13, 19)>
- 3-star with center node 18: <18, (15, 0, 8)>
- 3-star with center node 19: <19, (14, 10, 17)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we get 13 in total.

Therefore, the answer is [13].
