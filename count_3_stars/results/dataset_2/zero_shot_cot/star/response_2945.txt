Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 14) (15, 4) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 16) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 21) (8, 26) (22, 17) (22, 6) (26, 8) (26, 28) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 27) (28, 26) (6, 22) (6, 21) (6, 4) (6, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 6) (21, 0) (21, 4) (5, 1) (19, 3) (13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 20) (0, 2) (0, 21) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 16) (7, 2) (7, 11) (1, 5) (1, 20) (1, 12) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 1) (20, 18) (20, 9) (24, 3) (24, 27) (24, 9) (18, 0) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 16) (23, 9) (23, 27) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 23) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 18) (29, 13) (9, 14) (9, 20) (9, 24) (9, 23) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 21) (4, 10) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 23) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by counting the number of 4-node paths in the given graph. To find the total number of 3-stars, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (15, 24, 10)>
<15, (3, 14, 4)>
<14, (15, 17, 9)>
<17, (14, 22, 11)>
<2, (8, 7, 0)>
<8, (2, 21, 26)>
<22, (17, 6, 21)>
<26, (8, 28, -)>
<11, (17, 7, 27)>
<6, (22, 21, 4)>
<21, (14, 8, 6)>
<5, (1, -, -)>
<19, (3, -, -)>
<13, (17, 29, 20)>
<0, (2, 21, 10)>
<10, (3, 0, 4)>
<7, (2, 11, -)>
<1, (5, 20, 12)>
<20, (6, 13, 1)>
<24, (3, 27, 9)>
<18, (0, 20, 12)>
<23, (16, 9, 27)>
<27, (11, 24, 23)>
<12, (10, 1, 18)>
<29, (13, -, -)>
<9, (14, 20, 24)>
<4, (15, 6, 21)>
<16, (14, 10, 23)>

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find that there are [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
