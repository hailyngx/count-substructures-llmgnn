Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <6, (9, 4, 8)>
2. <9, (6, 4, 3)>
3. <1, (5, 0, 8)>
4. <3, (6, 9, 5)>
5. <4, (6, 9, 8)>
6. <8, (6, 1, 4)>
7. <2, (3, 4, 8)>
8. <0, (9, 1, 8)>
9. <7, (9, 1, 0)>
10. <5, (1, 3, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
