Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we can iterate through each node and check if it is the center of a 3-star.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Count the number of adjacent nodes each node has.
2. For each node with exactly three adjacent nodes:
   - Check if the three adjacent nodes are also connected to each other.
   - If so, it forms a 3-star.
3. Write down the unique 3-stars found.
4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars.

Let's start with the given graph:

Adjacent nodes for each node:
- Node 0: 4, adjacent to 5, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 6, adjacent to 9, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7
- Node 2: 5, adjacent to 9, 6, 1, 7
- Node 3: 5, adjacent to 5, 1, 4, 8, 0
- Node 4: 5, adjacent to 6, 1, 3, 8, 0
- Node 5: 3, adjacent to 0, 3, 9
- Node 6: 3, adjacent to 2, 8, 4
- Node 7: 4, adjacent to 1, 8, 0, 2
- Node 8: 5, adjacent to 6, 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 2, adjacent to 2, 1

3-stars in the graph:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [2]
