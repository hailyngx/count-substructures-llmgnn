Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list all the nodes that are the center of a 3-star. These nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 3.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 4.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 3, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 1.

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph:

We have the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 3)>
<4, (7, 8, 3)>
<7, (6, 9, 4)>
<8, (4, 2, 0)>
<2, (6, 9, 4)>
<0, (8, 3, 1)>
<1, (6, 9, 0)>
<3, (9, 4, 7)>
<5, (7, 3, 1)>

Finally, count the number of unique 3-stars: [10]
