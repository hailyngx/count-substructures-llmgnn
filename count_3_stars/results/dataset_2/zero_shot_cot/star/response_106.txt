Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 22) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 4) (0, 20) (20, 0) (20, 29) (20, 14) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 25) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 13) (14, 20) (14, 27) (14, 7) (4, 15) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 26) (13, 29) (26, 13) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 17) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 23) (1, 9) (17, 26) (28, 26) (28, 9) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 12) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 13) (29, 10) (29, 12) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 21) (16, 21) (16, 18) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 22) (21, 16) (21, 24) (12, 19) (12, 29) (12, 2) (12, 25) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 18) (9, 25) (9, 27) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 11) (24, 21) (24, 10) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 12) (25, 9) (10, 3) (10, 29) (10, 24) (10, 7) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 10) (27, 14) (27, 9) (11, 18) (23, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (20, 14, 27)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (15, 8, 21)>
<5, (6, 1, 29)>
<6, (15, 5, 13)>
<9, (1, 9, 28)>
<10, (3, 29, 24)>
<12, (19, 29, 25)>
<14, (20, 7, 27)>
<16, (21, 18, 24)>
<19, (15, 8, 12)>
<26, (13, 21, 28)>
