Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars. 

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 13, 4, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 13, 1, 6, and 2.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 13, 4, 14, and 12.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 2, 0, and 7.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 2, 3, and 1.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 11, 10, and 14.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 10, and 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 5, 3, 0, and 10.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 8, 6, 0, and 1.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 13, 4, 2, and 12.

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars:
<2, (8, 13, 4)>
<4, (13, 1, 6)>
<6, (13, 4, 14)>
<8, (13, 2, 0)>
<13, (8, 2, 1)>
<5, (2, 11, 10)>
<0, (8, 11, 10)>
<11, (5, 3, 0)>
<12, (8, 6, 1)>
<14, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (13, 4, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
