Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 4) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 11)>
<1, (6, 5, 4)>
<3, (11, 10, 14)>
<10, (3, 12, 7)>
<11, (9, 3, 14)>
<8, (6, 13, 0)>
<13, (6, 11, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 14)>
<14, (11, 0, 10)>
<2, (9, 13, 5)>
<5, (1, 11, 13)>
<7, (6, 9, 10)>
<4, (1, 10, 13)>
<12, (6, 1, 10)>
