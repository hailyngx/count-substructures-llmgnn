Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 14) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 15) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 17) (15, 1) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 14) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (3, 19) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of at least one 3-star. 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 15, and 14.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 16, 8, and 13.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 18, and 14.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 1.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 9, and 17.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 17, and 19.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 16, 1, and 5.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 4, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 5.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 16, 3, and 12.

Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 
[<1, (9, 15, 14)>, <2, (9, 10, 0)>, <4, (16, 8, 13)>, <5, (7, 18, 14)>, <9, (11, 6, 1)>, <11, (16, 9, 17)>, <12, (6, 17, 19)>, <14, (16, 1, 5)>, <16, (11, 4, 19)>, <18, (6, 8, 5)>, <19, (16, 3, 12)>]
