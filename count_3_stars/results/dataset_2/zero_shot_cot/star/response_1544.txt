Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.

From the connections above, we can see that there are four 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
