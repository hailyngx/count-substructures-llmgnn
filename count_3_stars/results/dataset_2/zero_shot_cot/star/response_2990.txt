Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 22) (15, 17) (27, 0) (27, 26) (27, 1) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 13) (9, 23) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (22, 15) (22, 11) (23, 9) (23, 4) (23, 25) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 20) (11, 22) (11, 10) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 25) (2, 8) (2, 28) (18, 0) (18, 1) (18, 8) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 29) (12, 3) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 21) (4, 23) (4, 5) (4, 25) (24, 19) (26, 27) (26, 20) (26, 3) (26, 17) (21, 9) (21, 11) (21, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 29) (19, 24) (19, 1) (16, 0) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 26) (29, 11) (29, 12) (29, 5) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 26) (1, 27) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 20) (20, 10) (20, 26) (20, 1) (14, 28) (14, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (28, 2) (28, 7) (28, 14) (25, 23) (25, 11) (25, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. For a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we have the following nodes:
- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29

Now, let's find the 3-stars by looking at each possible central node and its connections:
- <0, (27, 16, 5)>
- <1, (27, 18, 19)>
- <2, (8, 28, N/A)>
- <3, (0, 26, 12)>
- <4, (23, 5, 25)>
- <5, (0, 10, 29)>
- <6, (9, 17, 13)>
- <7, (10, 12, 28)>
- <8, (2, 18, 21)>
- <9, (6, 21, 13)>
- <10, (11, 7, 20)>
- <11, (22, 10, 25)>
- <12, (7, 29, 3)>
- <13, (6, 9, 14)>
- <14, (28, 13, N/A)>
- <15, (22, 17, N/A)>
- <16, (0, N/A, N/A)>
- <17, (15, 6, 26)>
- <18, (0, 1, 8)>
- <19, (24, 1, N/A)>
- <20, (10, 26, 1)>
- <21, (9, 11, 8)>
- <22, (15, 11, N/A)>
- <23, (9, 4, 25)>
- <24, (19, N/A, N/A)>
- <25, (23, 11, 4)>
- <26, (27, 20, 3)>
- <27, (0, 1, 26)>
- <28, (2, 7, 14)>
- <29, (11, 12, 5)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [26] 3-stars in the given graph.
