Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 18) (7, 1) (7, 17) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 16) (13, 15) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 2) (0, 12) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 19) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 6) (17, 11) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 19) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 5) (16, 8) (16, 5) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars.

Let's identify the central nodes and their adjacent nodes:

- Central node 0 is connected to nodes 12, 9, and 2.
- Central node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 10.
- Central node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 0.
- Central node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 12, and 18.
- Central node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 17, and 11.
- Central node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 18, and 16.
- Central node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 17.
- Central node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 18, and 1.
- Central node 8 is connected to node 16.
- Central node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 11, and 19.
- Central node 10 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 15.
- Central node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 17, and 19.
- Central node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 0, and 15.
- Central node 13 is not connected to any other nodes.
- Central node 14 is connected to nodes 19 and 10.
- Central node 15 is connected to nodes 13, 12, and 10.
- Central node 16 is connected to nodes 8, 5, and 18.
- Central node 17 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 6.
- Central node 18 is connected to nodes 7, 3, and 5.
- Central node 19 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Central node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 12, 9, and 2.
- Central node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 3, and 10.
- Central node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 0.
- Central node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 12, and 18.
- Central node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 17, and 11.
- Central node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 17, and 11.
- Central node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 18, and 16.
- Central node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 17, and 11.
- Central node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 11, and 19.
- Central node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 14, and 15.
- Central node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 17, and 19.
- Central node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 0, and 15.
- Central node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 13, 12, and 10.
- Central node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 16, and 5.
- Central node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 4, and 6.
- Central node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 18, 3, and 5.
- Central node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 14, and 9.
