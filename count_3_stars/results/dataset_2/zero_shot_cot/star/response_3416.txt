Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 12) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 5) (10, 17) (10, 2) (17, 4) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 13) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 13) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 15) (8, 17) (8, 18) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 18) (14, 1) (1, 14) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 18) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

<4, (11, 7, 17)>
<7, (4, 12, 19)>
<12, (16, 7, 13)>
<17, (4, 10, 8)>
<2, (10, 6, 19)>
<14, (0, 18, 1)>
<15, (5, 2, 9)>
<18, (8, 14, 9)>
<6, (5, 2, 13)>
<0, (11, 14, 19)>

Now, we count the number of 3-stars: [10].
