Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with degree 4. This will help identify potential center nodes for 3-stars. Node 5, 4, 1, and 2 have a degree of 4.

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 5: <5, (9, 6, 2)>
- From node 4: <4, (9, 7, 0)>
- From node 1: <1, (5, 4, 7)>
- From node 2: <2, (5, 9, 7)>

Therefore, there are [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
