Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 15) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 16) (25, 20) (25, 28) (25, 22) (8, 20) (8, 14) (13, 4) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 17) (17, 18) (17, 0) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 5) (21, 24) (21, 23) (24, 21) (24, 27) (22, 25) (22, 26) (22, 14) (22, 28) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 15) (28, 25) (28, 22) (28, 1) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 16) (27, 24) (27, 7) (27, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 1) (14, 5) (23, 21) (23, 26) (23, 6) (16, 20) (16, 4) (16, 15) (15, 11) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 0) (1, 28) (1, 14) (19, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (0, 17) (0, 29) (0, 15) (0, 9) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 29) (6, 23) (6, 19) (6, 3) (3, 19) (3, 6) (3, 12) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 27) (5, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 27) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 16
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 15, 22, and 23

Now, let's list the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (10, 13, 16)>
<26, (15, 22, 23)>

There are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
