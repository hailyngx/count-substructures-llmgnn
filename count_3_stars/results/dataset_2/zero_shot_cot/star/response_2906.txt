Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 3) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 6) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars:
<5, (9, 3, 7)>
<8, (4, 14, 6)>
<0, (14, 3, 1)>
<14, (8, 0, 13)>
<3, (5, 8, 0)>
<11, (5, 14, 3)>
<12, (3, 13, 1)>
<1, (0, 12, 6)>
<6, (8, 1, 2)>
<2, (9, 1, 6)>
<9, (5, 2, 13)>
<13, (9, 14, 12)>
<10, (3, 13, 7)>
<7, (5, 14, 10)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [14].
