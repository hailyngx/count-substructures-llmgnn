Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (17, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 9) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 0) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:
- From node 0: <0, (1, 6, 14)>
- From node 2: <2, (4, 5, 11)>
- From node 3: <3, (9, 18, 19)>
- From node 4: <4, (2, 15, 19)>
- From node 6: <6, (11, 14, 15)>
- From node 7: <7, (8, 10, 12)>
- From node 8: <8, (7, 10, 12)>
- From node 9: <9, (3, 13, 16)>
- From node 10: <10, (8, 12, 18)>
- From node 11: <11, (2, 6, 13)>
- From node 12: <12, (7, 10, 17)>
- From node 13: <13, (9, 11, 16)>
- From node 14: <14, (0, 6, 15)>
- From node 15: <15, (4, 6, 18)>
- From node 16: <16, (0, 9, 15)>
- From node 18: <18, (3, 10, 15)>
- From node 19: <19, (3, 4, 18)>

Since each 3-star is unique, we don't have any duplicates in our list. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
