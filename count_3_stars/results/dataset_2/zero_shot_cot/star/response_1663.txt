Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 19) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 13) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 16) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (16, 14) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (11, 14) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 17) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 13) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 6) (9, 3) (9, 2) (6, 0) (6, 19) (10, 19) (10, 8) (18, 0) (18, 5) (18, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of any 3-stars. Since a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find nodes with degree 3 and then check if there are corresponding edges connected to form a 3-star.

The nodes with degree 3 are:
- Node 3
- Node 15
- Node 0
- Node 7
- Node 16
- Node 14
- Node 5
- Node 11
- Node 13

Checking for 3-stars involving these nodes:
- From Node 3: <3, (5, 8, 9)>
- From Node 15: <15, (0, 13, 3)>
- From Node 0: <0, (7, 15, 18)>
- From Node 7: <7, (0, 1, 16)>
- From Node 16: <16, (4, 7, 17)>
- From Node 14: <14, (11, 16, 13)>
- From Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 18)>
- From Node 13: <13, (4, 11, 15)>

So, there are <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <15, (0, 13, 3)>, <0, (7, 15, 18)>, <7, (0, 1, 16)>, <16, (4, 7, 17)>, <14, (11, 16, 13)>, <5, (2, 4, 18)>, <13, (4, 11, 15)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
