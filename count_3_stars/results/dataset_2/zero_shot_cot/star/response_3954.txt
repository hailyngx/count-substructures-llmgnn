Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 11) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 14) (15, 11) (14, 15) (14, 17) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 12) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 16) (8, 2) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 2) (11, 0) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 7) (19, 5) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 0) (10, 9) (10, 12) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 18) (16, 4) (16, 12) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 12) (12, 17) (12, 10) (12, 16) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which could potentially form a 3-star. 
Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, and 16 are the nodes that have degree 3.

Now, let's list the 3-stars:
<1, (15, 1, 7)>
<2, (18, 2, 7)>
<4, (18, 4, 16)>
<6, (0, 6, 12)>
<11, (15, 11, 2)>
<12, (17, 12, 16)>
<13, (4, 13, 19)>
<16, (18, 16, 12)>
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
