Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 1) (16, 4) (9, 29) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 8) (2, 7) (29, 9) (29, 18) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 28) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 10) (8, 26) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 14) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 27) (12, 22) (12, 27) (12, 1) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 5) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 20) (24, 11) (24, 26) (24, 7) (21, 16) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 18) (10, 25) (10, 7) (15, 22) (15, 23) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 19) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 6) (19, 25) (19, 28) (19, 7) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 21) (18, 0) (14, 25) (14, 13) (14, 23) (20, 6) (20, 21) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 11) (17, 28) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 10) (7, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, indicating the center of potential 3-star graphs:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors (16, 9, 8, 12, 6, 26)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (9, 25, 28, 29)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (16, 5)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (27, 6, 0, 4)
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors (2, 8, 24, 10, 19)
- Node 11 has 3 neighbors (16, 24, 17)
- Node 14 has 4 neighbors (25, 13, 23, 19)
- Node 15 has 2 neighbors (22, 23)
- Node 16 has 4 neighbors (11, 21, 1, 4)
- Node 18 has 4 neighbors (29, 27, 21, 0)
- Node 21 has 4 neighbors (16, 6, 20, 18)
- Node 22 has 3 neighbors (23, 15, 12)
- Node 23 has 4 neighbors (22, 15, 14, 27)
- Node 24 has 4 neighbors (11, 26, 7, 21)
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors (3, 19, 14, 10)
- Node 26 has 2 neighbors (24, 8)
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors (23, 12, 18, 5)
- Node 28 has 3 neighbors (3, 17, 19)
- Node 29 has 3 neighbors (9, 18, 0)

Now, for each potential center node identified above, we check if it forms a 3-star graph by connecting to exactly three other nodes. 

After checking all the potential center nodes, we find that there are 6 unique 3-star graphs in the given graph. 

Therefore, the answer is: [6]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (16, 9, 8)>
<4, (16, 5, 27)>
<7, (2, 24, 19)>
<11, (16, 24, 17)>
<14, (25, 13, 23)>
<18, (29, 27, 21)>
