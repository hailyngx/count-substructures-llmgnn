Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 12) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
First, we identify all the 3-star configurations in the graph. 

1. <4, (7, 5, 6)>
2. <7, (4, 8, 13)>
3. <1, (3, 11, 0)>
4. <3, (1, 6, 12)>
5. <10, (11, 5, 14)>
6. <12, (3, 2, 6)>
7. <2, (12, 9, 13)>
8. <8, (7, 12, 0)>
9. <5, (4, 10, 12)>
10. <13, (7, 2, 9)>
11. <9, (10, 11, 0)>
12. <0, (11, 8, 9)>
13. <14, (10, 11, 2)>
14. <6, (4, 3, 12)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars:
