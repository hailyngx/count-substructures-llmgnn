Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 19) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 17) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 7) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 11) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 19) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 12) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 1) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 2) (16, 18) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. 

Let's list down the unique 3-stars in the graph: 
<4, (8, 11, 17)>
<5, (2, 0, 18)>
<8, (4, 0, 12)>
<10, (3, 1, 7)>
<13, (4, 14, 1)>
<16, (9, 2, 18)>
<18, (5, 6, 0)>
<19, (9, 7, 12)>

Now, we need to count the total number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
