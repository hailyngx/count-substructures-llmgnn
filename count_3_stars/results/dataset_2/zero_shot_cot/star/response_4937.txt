Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (10, 6) (10, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 9) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 11, 9)>
<2, (5, 6, 14)>
<3, (5, 6, 12)>
<4, (0, 7, 13)>
<5, (1, 11, 13)>
<6, (2, 5, 10)>
<7, (4, 0, 13)>
<8, (0, 12, 14)>
<9, (1, 13, 14)>
<10, (6, 8, 3)>
<11, (1, 5, 13)>
<12, (6, 3, 8)>
<13, (7, 5, 11)>
<14, (7, 2, 9)>

There are a total of 14 3-stars in the given graph, which can be represented as:

[14]
