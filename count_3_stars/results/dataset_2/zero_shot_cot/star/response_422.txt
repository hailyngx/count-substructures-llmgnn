Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list out all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 5, 4)>
<3, (1, 5, 2)>
<5, (6, 1, 3)>
<9, (6, 4, 0)>
<4, (9, 1, 10)>
<7, (10, 11, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 12)>
<0, (9, 12, 13)>
<2, (3, 5, 14)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars.
