Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern, where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. <5, (9, 4, 3)>
2. <9, (5, 8, 1)>
3. <6, (5, 3, 2)>
4. <4, (5, 9, 7)>
5. <7, (6, 4, 1)>
6. <1, (9, 7, 8)>
7. <3, (5, 6, -)>
8. <8, (9, 6, 1)>
9. <0, (4, 7, 8)>
10. <2, (6, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
