Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 10) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 1) (6, 5) (0, 11) (0, 3) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 17) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 12) (17, 7) (17, 4) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 12) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 12) (2, 9) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 18) (12, 1) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 11 since it has the most edges. 
Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 19, and 0. 
Let's look at the connections of these nodes: 
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 7, 19, and 10. 
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 11, 16, 8, and 13. 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11 and 3. 

Next, let's look at the connections of nodes 1, 3, and 8 since they have the most connections after nodes 11, 16, and 19. 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 12, and 8. 
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 14, 8, and 4. 
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 19, and no other node has more connections. 

Now, let's examine the connections of nodes 13, 5, and 6. 
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 19. 
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 6, 18. 
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5. 

After evaluating the connections, the unique 3-star configurations are as follows:
<11, (16, 19, 0)>
<8, (1, 3, 19)>
<6, (1, 5, 18)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
