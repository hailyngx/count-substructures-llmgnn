Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 13) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the given edges. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 8 has 6 connections.
   - Node 4 has 5 connections.
   - Node 9 has 4 connections.
   - Node 3 and node 11 each have 4 connections.
   - Node 12, node 1, node 10, and node 14 each have 4 connections.

2. For each of the identified nodes, determine the 3-stars they are part of:
   - Node 8 forms 4 3-stars: <8, (5, 4, 11)>, <8, (4, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 11)>, <8, (6, 11, 14)>.
   - Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (9, 7, 12)>.
   - Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (4, 11, 3)>.
   - Node 3 forms 3 3-stars: <3, (9, 11, 13)>, <3, (4, 11, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 10)>.
   - Node 11 forms 2 3-stars: <11, (9, 3, 6)>, <11, (8, 14, 6)>.
   - Node 12, node 1, node 10, and node 14 don't form any unique 3-stars based on the given edges.

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
   - <8, (5, 4, 11)>, <8, (4, 3, 6)>, <8, (1, 3, 11)>, <8, (6, 11, 14)>, <4, (9, 7, 12)>, <9, (4, 11, 3)>, <3, (9, 11, 13)>, <3, (4, 11, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 10)>, <11, (9, 3, 6)>, <11, (8, 14, 6)>.

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
