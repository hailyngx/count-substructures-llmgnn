Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list out the 3-stars present in the graph:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 10)>
<4, (1, 5, 13)>
<5, (4, 7, 13)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (4, 5, 10)>
<9, (1, 6, 12)>
<10, (3, 5, 12)>
<12, (9, 10, 11)>
<13, (4, 2, 5)>
<14, (0, 2, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars: [11].
