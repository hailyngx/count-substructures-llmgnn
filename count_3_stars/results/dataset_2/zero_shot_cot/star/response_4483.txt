Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 10) (9, 8) (9, 15) (1, 20) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 27) (7, 21) (7, 20) (21, 6) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 22) (10, 6) (10, 17) (10, 27) (10, 23) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 16) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 22) (8, 18) (29, 5) (24, 6) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 15) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 13) (28, 18) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 20) (12, 17) (12, 2) (2, 12) (2, 22) (2, 13) (2, 25) (22, 21) (22, 8) (22, 2) (11, 14) (11, 25) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (23, 21) (23, 10) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 5) (15, 9) (15, 26) (15, 16) (15, 0) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 19) (27, 3) (27, 10) (27, 17) (18, 8) (18, 28) (18, 14) (18, 13) (25, 2) (25, 11) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 18) (5, 21) (5, 29) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes directly. Let's list them one 3-star at a time:

1. <8, (9, 4, 22)>
2. <10, (6, 23, 17)>
3. <21, (7, 5, 22)>
4. <4, (8, 16, 19)>
5. <15, (26, 0, 16)>
6. <9, (8, 15, 1)>
7. <20, (1, 7, 19)>
8. <7, (21, 20, 5)>
9. <17, (10, 12, 27)>
10. <16, (4, 15, 28)>
11. <26, (24, 15, 26)>
12. <5, (21, 0, 29)>
13. <22, (8, 21, 2)>
14. <2, (12, 22, 13)>
15. <27, (10, 17, 3)>
16. <18, (8, 28, 14)>
17. <25, (2, 11, 25)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
