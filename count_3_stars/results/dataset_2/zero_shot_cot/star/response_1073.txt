Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (16, 12) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 9) (2, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 10) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 0) (10, 12) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 10) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 3) (9, 4) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 19) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 2) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star:
- Node 3 is connected to 5 other nodes: 0, 6, 9, 15, 19
- Node 15 is connected to 5 other nodes: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes: 8, 9, 13
- Node 2 is connected to 4 other nodes: 1, 6, 15, 18
- Node 18 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 5, 10
- Node 0 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 10, 14
- Node 14 is connected to 3 other nodes: 0, 7, 12
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes: 2, 11, 17
- Node 17 is connected to 2 other nodes: 1, 5
- Node 10 is connected to 4 other nodes: 0, 12, 16, 18
- Node 12 is connected to 3 other nodes: 10, 14, 16
- Node 5 is connected to 3 other nodes: 15, 17, 18
- Node 7 is connected to 4 other nodes: 14, 15, 19, 8

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- 3-star with center node 3: <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (15, 2, 5)>, <3, (19, 4, 7)>
- 3-star with center node 15: <15, (2, 3, 5)>, <15, (6, 3, 7)>, <15, (5, 7, 18)>
- 3-star with center node 4: <4, (9, 3, 13)>, <4, (8, 9, 13)>
- 3-star with center node 2: <2, (1, 15, 18)>, <2, (6, 3, 18)>
- 3-star with center node 18: <18, (2, 5, 10)>
- 3-star with center node 0: <0, (3, 10, 14)>
- 3-star with center node 14: <14, (7, 12, 14)>
- 3-star with center node 1: <1, (11, 17, 2)>
- 3-star with center node 17: <17, (1, 5, 17)>
- 3-star with center node 10: <10, (12, 16, 18)>
- 3-star with center node 12: <12, (16, 10, 14)>
- 3-star with center node 5: <5, (15, 17, 18)>
- 3-star with center node 7: <7, (14, 19, 8)>, <7, (15, 19, 8)>

Therefore, there are 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The answer is [14].
