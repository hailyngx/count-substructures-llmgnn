Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 4:

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 9, and 0.

Next, let's check each of these nodes to see if they form 3-stars with node 4.

- Node 4 with nodes 7, 8, 9: 

   - <4, (7, 8, 9)> is a 3-star.

Now, we can count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
