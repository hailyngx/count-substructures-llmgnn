Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes forming a star shape.

From the given graph, we can identify the following 3-star graphs:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 0)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<9, (8, 0, 1)>

Hence, there are [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
