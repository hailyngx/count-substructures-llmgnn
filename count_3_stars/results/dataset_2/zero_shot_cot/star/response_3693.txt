Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 21) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 28) (27, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (20, 9) (25, 13) (25, 2) (15, 20) (15, 26) (15, 8) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 2) (29, 28) (29, 18) (29, 3) (22, 24) (26, 27) (26, 15) (9, 20) (9, 13) (9, 23) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 19) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 12) (4, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 8) (21, 0) (21, 27) (21, 16) (17, 23) (18, 29) (18, 3) (18, 23) (18, 19) (18, 24) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 6) (1, 12) (1, 24) (2, 25) (2, 28) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 22) (24, 18) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 7) (7, 24) (13, 25) (13, 9) (13, 23) (5, 4) (5, 10) (10, 19) (10, 5) (10, 14) (14, 19) (14, 10) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which indicates the presence of a 3-star structure.
The nodes that satisfy this criteria are: 0, 27, 28, 20, 26, 9, 3, 11, 23, 4, 12, 16, 21, 18, 19, and 6.

Now, let's construct the 3-stars using the identified nodes and their connections:
- From node 0: <0, (27, 28, 21)>
- From node 27: <27, (0, 21, 28)>
- From node 28: <28, (0, 27, 29)>
- From node 20: <20, (15, 8, 9)>
- From node 26: <26, (27, 15, 8)>
- From node 9: <9, (20, 13, 23)>
- From node 3: <3, (29, 11, 16)>
- From node 11: <11, (3, 23, 19)>
- From node 23: <23, (9, 11, 18)>
- From node 4: <4, (12, 5, 6)>
- From node 12: <12, (4, 6, 1)>
- From node 16: <16, (3, 21, 8)>
- From node 21: <21, (0, 27, 16)>
- From node 18: <18, (29, 3, 23)>
- From node 19: <19, (11, 18, 14)>
- From node 6: <6, (0, 12, 19)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
