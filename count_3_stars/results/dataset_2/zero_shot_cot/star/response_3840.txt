Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (0, 7) (0, 15) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 4) (18, 19) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 2) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 17) (19, 3) (1, 5) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 19) (16, 17) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 12) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 10) 

Response:
Let's start by finding the nodes with exactly three neighbors, as these nodes can potentially be the centers of 3-stars. 

Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 5 
- Node 9 

Now, let's check for 3-stars centered at Node 5:
- From the edge list, the three neighbors of Node 5 are 9, 2, and 1. 
- Therefore, there is a 3-star centered at Node 5: <5, (9, 2, 1)>. 

Now, let's check for 3-stars centered at Node 9:
- From the edge list, the three neighbors of Node 9 are 5, 10, and 3. 
- Therefore, there is a 3-star centered at Node 9: <9, (5, 10, 3)>. 

Therefore, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
