Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 10) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 10) (10, 7) (10, 12) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars:
- Node 5 has connections with nodes 9, 6, and 2.
- Node 1 has connections with nodes 3, 2, and 4.
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 has connections with nodes 5, 8, and 14.
- Node 0 has connections with nodes 9, 14, and 7.
- Node 14 has connections with nodes 1, 6, and 0.
- Node 7 has connections with nodes 0, 2, and 10.
- Node 12 has connections with nodes 9, 1, and 10.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
There are <5, (9, 6, 2)>, <1, (3, 2, 4)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (5, 8, 14)>, <0, (9, 14, 7)>, <14, (1, 6, 0)>, <7, (0, 2, 10)>, <12, (9, 1, 10)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
