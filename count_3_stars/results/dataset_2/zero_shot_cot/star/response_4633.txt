Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

The 3-stars in the graph are as follows:
<0, (5, 10, 14)>
<1, (2, 11, 13)>
<2, (1, 10, 13)>
<3, (4, 8, 10)>
<4, (3, 9, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 14)>
<6, (5, 10, 14)>
<7, (0, 11, 12)>
<8, (4, 9, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 14)>
<10, (2, 3, 6)>
<11, (1, 7, 12)>
<12, (7, 11, 6)>
<13, (1, 2, 3)>
<14, (0, 5, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 

There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
