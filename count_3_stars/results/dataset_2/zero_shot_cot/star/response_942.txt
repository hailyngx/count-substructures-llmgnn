Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 15) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (1, 19) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 19) (17, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (11, 18) (11, 13) (11, 4) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 4) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 11) (4, 19) (15, 2) (15, 9) (15, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 10) (18, 11) (18, 14) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 14)>
<3, (0, 17, 19)>
<4, (11, 17, 19)>
<5, (2, 10, 14)>
<6, (12, 16, 19)>
<7, (10, 12, 16)>
<8, (0, 9, 12)>
<9, (8, 13, 15)>
<10, (5, 7, 13)>
<11, (4, 13, 18)>
<12, (6, 8, 13)>
<13, (9, 11, 15)>
<14, (2, 6, 18)>
<15, (2, 9, 13)>
<16, (6, 7, 16)>
<17, (3, 4, 7)>
<18, (11, 14, 18)>
<19, (1, 3, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 

There are 20 unique 3-stars found above so the final answer is [20].
