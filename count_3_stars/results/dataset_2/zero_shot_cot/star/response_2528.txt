Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's examine each node and its connections to identify any 3-stars.

1. Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 3) -> No 3-star containing node 0.
2. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7) -> Two 3-stars with center at node 1: <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>.
3. Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 4), (2, 8) -> One 3-star with center at node 2: <2, (5, 6, 4)>.
4. Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0) -> One 3-star with center at node 3: <3, (9, 1, 7)>.
5. Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 1), (4, 8), (4, 2) -> Four 3-stars with center at node 4: <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>, <4, (9, 6, 2)>.
6. Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4) -> No 3-star containing node 5.
7. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 2), (6, 4) -> One 3-star with center at node 6: <6, (1, 7, 4)>.
8. Node 7: (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 1), (7, 3) -> No 3-star containing node 7.
9. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 2) -> No 3-star containing node 8.
10. Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0) -> One 3-star with center at node 9: <9, (4, 3, 7)>.

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [7]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 4)>, <3, (9, 1, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (5, 1, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 2)>
