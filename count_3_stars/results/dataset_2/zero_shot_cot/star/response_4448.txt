Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star graph, where each central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.
Looking at the provided edges:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 0, and 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 6.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 2.

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in this graph is [6].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 1, 4)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (9, 4, 6)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (5, 1, 3)>
