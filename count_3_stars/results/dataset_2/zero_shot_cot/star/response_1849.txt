Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 18) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 18) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 15) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 17) (8, 7) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 2) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (6, 13) (17, 9) (17, 8) (17, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 18) (13, 6) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 5, 2)>
<1, (0, 5, 19)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 2, 3)>
<4, (3, 17, 7)>
<5, (9, 15, 0)>
<6, (13, 7, 19)>
<7, (8, 4, 19)>
<8, (10, 2, 7)>
<9, (5, 17, 12)>
<10, (11, 8, 18)>
<11, (10, 16, 14)>
<12, (9, 19, 18)>
<13, (6, 7, 19)>
<14, (11, 16, 18)>
<15, (9, 5, 2)>
<16, (11, 14, 16)>
<17, (9, 4, 8)>
<18, (14, 12, 11)>
<19, (1, 7, 12)>

Now we count the total number of unique 3-stars:

[20]
