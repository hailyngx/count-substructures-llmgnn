Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (7, 10, 14)>
<1, (6, 7, 14)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<3, (7, 12, 14)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<5, (2, 12, 13)>
<6, (1, 7, 14)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
<8, (10, 12, 13)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<10, (0, 8, 12)>
<11, (0, 7, 13)>
<12, (3, 5, 10)>
<13, (5, 11, 12)>
<14, (0, 3, 6)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
