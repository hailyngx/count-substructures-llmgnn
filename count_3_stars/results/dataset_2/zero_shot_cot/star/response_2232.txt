Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 15) (16, 3) (16, 9) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 15) (18, 17) (18, 13) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 5) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 1) (2, 14) (2, 9) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 16) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 7) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 19) (1, 5) (1, 9) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to node 0:
   Node 3, Node 7

2. Identify all nodes connected to node 1:
   Node 5, Node 9, Node 19

3. Identify all nodes connected to node 2:
   Node 9, Node 14

4. Identify all nodes connected to node 3:
   Node 0, Node 16

5. Identify all nodes connected to node 4:
   Node 8, Node 15, Node 17, Node 19

6. Identify all nodes connected to node 5:
   Node 1, Node 7, Node 8, Node 10, Node 11

7. Identify all nodes connected to node 6:
   Node 13, Node 17

8. Identify all nodes connected to node 7:
   Node 0, Node 5, Node 15

9. Identify all nodes connected to node 8:
   Node 4, Node 5, Node 15, Node 19

10. Identify all nodes connected to node 9:
    Node 1, Node 2, Node 10, Node 11, Node 16

11. Identify all nodes connected to node 10:
    Node 5, Node 9, Node 12

12. Identify all nodes connected to node 11:
    Node 5, Node 9, Node 15

13. Identify all nodes connected to node 12:
    Node 10, Node 14

14. Identify all nodes connected to node 13:
    Node 6, Node 18

15. Identify all nodes connected to node 14:
    Node 2, Node 12, Node 17, Node 19

16. Identify all nodes connected to node 15:
    Node 4, Node 7, Node 8, Node 11, Node 19

17. Identify all nodes connected to node 16:
    Node 3, Node 9

18. Identify all nodes connected to node 17:
    Node 4, Node 6, Node 14, Node 18

19. Identify all nodes connected to node 18:
    Node 13, Node 17

20. Identify all nodes connected to node 19:
    Node 1, Node 4, Node 8, Node 14, Node 15

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by counting the number of unique configurations. 

There are [5] 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (3, 7, 15)>, <4, (8, 15, 19)>, <5, (7, 8, 10)>, <9, (1, 2, 16)>, <11, (5, 9, 15)>.
