Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 9, 12)>
<1, (0, 2, 13)>
<2, (1, 9, 11)>
<3, (7, 11, 12)>
<4, (9, 12, 13)>
<5, (8, 10, 12)>
<6, (1, 13, 14)>
<7, (3, 9, 11)>
<8, (5, 10, 14)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<10, (5, 10, 13)>
<11, (2, 3, 7)>
<12, (0, 4, 7)>
<13, (1, 4, 6)>
<14, (6, 8, 10)>

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
