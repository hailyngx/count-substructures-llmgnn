Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (11, 13) (11, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 12) (3, 8) (3, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0: (4, 18, 17)
- Node 1: (5, 17, 15)
- Node 2: (5, 7, 16)
- Node 3: (8, 12)
- Node 6: (13, 15, 19, 14)
- Node 8: (13, 7, 3)
- Node 9: (2, 15, 12)
- Node 11: (13, 18)
- Node 12: (0, 14, 9, 3)
- Node 13: (8, 5, 11, 6)
- Node 15: (17, 10, 6, 9)
- Node 16: (2, 0)
- Node 17: (0, 1)
- Node 18: (4, 11, 7, 19)
- Node 19: (18, 10, 6)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
After examining all the combinations, we find **7 unique 3-stars** in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is **[7]**.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 18, 17)>
<1, (5, 17, 15)>
<2, (5, 7, 16)>
<3, (8, 12, 3)>
<6, (13, 15, 19)>
<8, (13, 7, 3)>
<9, (15, 6, 9)>
