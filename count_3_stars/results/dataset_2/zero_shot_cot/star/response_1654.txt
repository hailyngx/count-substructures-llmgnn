Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 19) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 1) (22, 28) (22, 24) (23, 5) (23, 14) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 26) (27, 2) (27, 20) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 10) (28, 2) (28, 20) (20, 27) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 18) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 14) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 3) (19, 16) (19, 8) (14, 23) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 21) (26, 12) (26, 14) (26, 21) (21, 14) (21, 26) (0, 29) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 4) (0, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 18) (5, 23) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 25) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (2, 27) (2, 28) (2, 25) (15, 0) (15, 17) (13, 16) (13, 12) (25, 6) (25, 24) (25, 2) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 3) (10, 28) (10, 3) (17, 15) (17, 4) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 17)
