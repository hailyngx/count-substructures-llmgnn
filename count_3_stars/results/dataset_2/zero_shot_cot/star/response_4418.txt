Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 17) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 15) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 16) (0, 10) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (19, 6) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (3, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 15) (11, 18) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 18) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 5) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (17, 7) (17, 2) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are a part of a 3-star by checking which nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The nodes with degree 3 in this graph are:  
Node 1 (connected to nodes 9, 8, 13)  
Node 2 (connected to nodes 8, 3, 11)  
Node 4 (connected to nodes 13, 10, 3)  
Node 5 (connected to nodes 6, 1, 15)  
Node 7 (connected to nodes 12, 0, 17)  
Node 9 (connected to nodes 14, 1, 13)  
Node 10 (connected to nodes 0, 3, 4)  
Node 11 (connected to nodes 2, 15, 18)  
Node 12 (connected to nodes 13, 7, 0)  
Node 13 (connected to nodes 9, 12, 4)  
Node 14 (connected to nodes 9, 15, 18)  
Node 15 (connected to nodes 5, 16, 11)  
Node 16 (connected to nodes 0, 15)  
Node 18 (connected to nodes 15, 11, 14)  

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph based on the nodes identified above:

<1, (9, 8, 13)>  
<2, (8, 3, 11)>  
<4, (13, 10, 3)>  
<5, (6, 1, 15)>  
<7, (12, 0, 17)>  
<9, (14, 1, 13)>  
<10, (0, 3, 4)>  
<11, (2, 15, 18)>  
<12, (13, 7, 0)>  
<13, (9, 12, 4)>  
<14, (9, 15, 18)>  
<15, (5, 16, 11)>  
<16, (0, 15)>  
<18, (15, 11, 14)>

There are 14 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the answer is [14].
