Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 0) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 13) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 6, 12)>
<1, (4, 6, 14)>
<2, (3, 9, 13)>
<3, (2, 5, 10)>
<4, (1, 8, 11)>
<5, (3, 6, 13)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (5, 13, 14)>
<8, (4, 9, 11)>
<9, (2, 8, 14)>
<10, (3, 4, 12)>
<11, (0, 4, 8)>
<12, (0, 10, 13)>
<13, (2, 5, 10)>
<14, (1, 7, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
