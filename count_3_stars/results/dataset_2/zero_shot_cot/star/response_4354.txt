Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars:
- <1, (5, 8, 3)>
- <4, (9, 8, 6)>
- <7, (9, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 8, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of 5 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
