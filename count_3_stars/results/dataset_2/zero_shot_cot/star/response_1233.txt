Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three connecting edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<10, (3, 6, 12)>
<11, (14, 0, 12)>
<7, (12, 6, 10)>
<12, (10, 11, 7)>
<2, (11, 9, 14)>
<9, (2, 8, 14)>
<13, (10, 5, 6)>
<0, (11, 13, 9)>
<3, (10, 5, 6)>
<1, (10, 1, 13)>

So, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
