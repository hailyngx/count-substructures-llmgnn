Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 8) (16, 13) (16, 25) (16, 8) (13, 16) (13, 22) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 29) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 21) (9, 17) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 27) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 14) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 28) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 1) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 28) (15, 1) (15, 7) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 4) (29, 22) (29, 19) (23, 11) (23, 4) (19, 22) (19, 29) (26, 6) (26, 27) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 24) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 4) (25, 16) (25, 21) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 0) (21, 25) (24, 2) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 28) (12, 3) (12, 24) (12, 6) (27, 14) (27, 26) (4, 20) (4, 23) (4, 3) (4, 0) (10, 9) (10, 24) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 18) (6, 13) (6, 22) (6, 26) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<1, (8, 14, 15)>
<2, (5, 24, 28)>
<3, (4, 7, 12)>
<4, (0, 21, 23)>
<5, (2, 17, 21)>
<6, (12, 13, 22)>
<7, (3, 15, 24)>
<8, (1, 11, 16)>
<9, (10, 14, 17)>
<13, (6, 18, 22)>
<16, (8, 13, 16)>
<17, (5, 9, 14)>
<18, (13, 14, 28)>
<19, (22, 29, 19)>
<20, (1, 4, 21)>
<21, (0, 5, 25)>
<22, (13, 19, 29)>
<24, (2, 7, 10)>
<27, (14, 26, 27)>
<28, (1, 18, 28)>
<29, (19, 22, 29)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-star configurations in the given graph.
