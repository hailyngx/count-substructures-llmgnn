Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (7, 0, 2)>
<7, (4, 0, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 5)>
<3, (1, 0, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (7, 3, -)>
<8, (4, 1, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 5)>
<0, (4, 7, 3)>
<5, (7, 1, 8)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, hence the final count of 3-stars is [10].
