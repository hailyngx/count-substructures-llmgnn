Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (16, 11) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 0) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 18) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 19) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 10) (19, 2) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 12) (18, 7) (18, 8) (18, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node (center) and its three connected nodes (leaves) for each 3-star.

Let's go through the given edges and find the 3-stars:
1. From node 3: (3, 11), (3, 15), (3, 8)
2. From node 4: (4, 7), (4, 9), (4, 17)
3. From node 7: (7, 4), (7, 14), (7, 18)
4. From node 8: (8, 3), (8, 13), (8, 14)
5. From node 9: (9, 4), (9, 10), (9, 12)
6. From node 12: (12, 10), (12, 2), (12, 5)

Count of 3-stars: 6
[6]

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (11, 15, 8)>
<4, (7, 9, 17)>
<7, (4, 14, 18)>
<8, (3, 13, 14)>
<9, (4, 10, 12)>
<12, (10, 2, 5)>
