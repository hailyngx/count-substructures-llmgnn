Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 0) (22, 7) (22, 25) (22, 17) (9, 26) (9, 2) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 28) (26, 6) (14, 17) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 20) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 27) (3, 2) (25, 22) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 15) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 10) (7, 8) (21, 9) (21, 7) (21, 23) (21, 15) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 18) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (27, 3) (16, 13) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 19) (20, 17) (20, 24) (12, 4) (5, 28) (5, 24) (5, 15) (1, 11) (11, 1) (24, 3) (24, 29) (24, 20) (24, 5) (18, 13) (18, 29) (18, 23) (23, 21) (23, 18) (23, 2) (6, 26) (6, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 23) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 15) (15, 25) (15, 21) (15, 5) (15, 8) (19, 16) (19, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

First, let's identify all the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 13: (13, 22), (13, 17), (13, 16)
- Node 22: (22, 13), (22, 0), (22, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 26), (9, 2), (9, 21)
- Node 26: (26, 9), (26, 28), (26, 6)
- Node 16: (16, 13), (16, 28), (16, 8)
- Node 29: (29, 17), (29, 25), (29, 24)
- Node 0: (0, 22), (0, 4), (0, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 22), (7, 21), (7, 10)
- Node 21: (21, 9), (21, 7), (21, 23)
- Node 28: (28, 26), (28, 16), (28, 5)
- Node 24: (24, 3), (24, 29), (24, 20)
- Node 18: (18, 13), (18, 29), (18, 23)
- Node 23: (23, 21), (23, 18), (23, 2)
- Node 6: (6, 26), (6, 19)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<13, (22, 17, 16)>
<22, (13, 0, 7)>
<9, (26, 2, 21)>
<26, (9, 28, 6)>
<16, (13, 28, 8)>
<29, (17, 25, 24)>
<0, (22, 4, 8)>
<7, (22, 21, 10)>
<21, (9, 7, 23)>
<28, (26, 16, 5)>
<24, (3, 29, 20)>
<18, (13, 29, 23)>
<23, (21, 18, 2)>
<6, (26, 19, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
