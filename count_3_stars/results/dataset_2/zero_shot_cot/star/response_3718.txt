Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 3) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node has exactly three neighbors (leaves) connected to it, forming a 3-star. Let's go step-by-step on this task:

1. Count the degree of each node by counting how many edges are incident to it:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 5
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 5
- Node 12: degree 5
- Node 13: degree 5
- Node 14: degree 4

2. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors, these nodes can be the centers of 3-stars:
- Node 2 has degree 3: <2, (10, 14, 11)>
- Node 10 has degree 3: <10, (4, 7, 2)>

There are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
