Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars:
- The node 5 has 5 edges connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, 4, and 3.
- The node 9 has 6 edges connected to nodes 5, 6, 8, 3, 7, and 0.
- The node 4 has 5 edges connected to nodes 5, 0, 1, 2, and 1.
- The node 7 has 2 edges connected to nodes 9 and 8.
- The node 6 has 3 edges connected to nodes 5, 9, and 3.
- The node 1 has 2 edges connected to nodes 4 and 3.
- The node 3 has 6 edges connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 1, 0, and 1.
- The node 8 has 5 edges connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 2, and 0.
- The node 2 has 3 edges connected to nodes 4, 8, and 0.
- The node 0 has 5 edges connected to nodes 9, 4, 3, 8, and 2.

Let's count the 3-stars:
