Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

Unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 3, 5)>
<6, (9, 1, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 2)>
<2, (9, 8, 3)>
<8, (6, 9, 1)>
