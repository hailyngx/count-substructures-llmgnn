Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 2) (26, 9) (26, 28) (3, 2) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 6) (15, 16) (14, 11) (14, 7) (17, 19) (17, 18) (25, 9) (25, 27) (25, 0) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (27, 25) (27, 22) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 18) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 1) (18, 29) (28, 26) (28, 29) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 5) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 8) (7, 14) (7, 12) (7, 23) (22, 27) (6, 15) (6, 21) (6, 8) (21, 6) (21, 23) (21, 4) (4, 12) (4, 21) (4, 20) (4, 11) (0, 25) (0, 28) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 24) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 24) (16, 15) (16, 12) (24, 28) (24, 10) (24, 11) (24, 1) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 10) (5, 28) (5, 8) (8, 29) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 1) (20, 4) (20, 8) (20, 13) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 21) (23, 1) (13, 20) (1, 18) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 8) (1, 23) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph.

1. Looking at the provided edges and the description of a 3-star graph, we need to identify nodes that form 3-stars. In a 3-star, there is one central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

2. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
   - Nodes 9, 25, 28 form a 3-star: <9, (25, 26, 28)>
   - Nodes 25, 27, 28 form a 3-star: <25, (9, 27, 28)>
   - Nodes 2, 18, 29 form a 3-star: <2, (9, 18, 29)>
   - Nodes 9, 2, 3 form a 3-star: <9, (25, 2, 3)>
   - Nodes 15, 19, 10 form a 3-star: <15, (6, 17, 19)>
   - Nodes 15, 16, 12 form a 3-star: <15, (6, 16, 12)>
   - Nodes 14, 7, 23 form a 3-star: <14, (11, 7, 23)>
   - Nodes 1, 8, 23 form a 3-star: <1, (18, 8, 23)>
   - Node 0 is not the center of any 3-star as it has only two edges.
   - Nodes 28, 29, 24 form a 3-star: <28, (26, 29, 24)>
   - Node 21 is not the center of any 3-star as it has only two edges.
   - Node 4 is not the center of any 3-star as it has only two edges.
   - Node 6 is not the center of any 3-star as it has only two edges.
   - Node 5 is not the center of any 3-star as it has only two edges.
   - Nodes 18, 17, 1 form a 3-star: <18, (2, 17, 1)>
   - Nodes 20, 8, 4 form a 3-star: <20, (13, 8, 4)>

3. Counting the total number of 3-stars found, we have 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
