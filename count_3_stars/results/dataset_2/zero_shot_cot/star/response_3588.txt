Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 5) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 8) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 16) (19, 12) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 3) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 15) (10, 16) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 2) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 9) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three leaves. Let's go step by step:

1. Find all nodes with exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 11 has neighbors 9, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 has neighbors 16, 18, and 5.
- Node 14 has neighbors 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 1 has neighbors 4, 14, and 17.
- Node 6 has neighbors 11, 17, and 2.
- Node 3 has neighbors 4, 2, and 9.
- Node 13 has neighbors 7, 12, and 10.

2. For each of the nodes found in step 1, check if they form a 3-star:
- Node 11 forms a 3-star: <11, (9, 6, 8)>.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (16, 18, 5)>.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star: <14, (0, 1, 5)>.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (4, 14, 17)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (11, 17, 2)>.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 2, 9)>.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star: <13, (7, 12, 10)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
