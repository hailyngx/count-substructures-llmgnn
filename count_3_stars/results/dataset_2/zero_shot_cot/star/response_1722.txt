Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three connections. We can identify the 3-stars by noting the relationships between the central node and the three other nodes it connects to. 

Let's start by listing the nodes that have exactly three connections:
- Node 1 has connections with nodes 6, 9, and 3.
- Node 3 has connections with nodes 1, 5, and 4.
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 3, 8, and 0.
- Node 5 has connections with nodes 6, 3, and 2.
- Node 7 has connections with nodes 6, 9, and 1.
- Node 8 has connections with nodes 3, 4, and 2.
- Node 9 has connections with nodes 6, 2, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <1, (6, 9, 3)>
- <3, (1, 5, 4)>
- <4, (3, 8, 0)>
- <5, (6, 3, 2)>
- <7, (6, 9, 1)>
- <8, (3, 4, 2)>
- <9, (6, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
