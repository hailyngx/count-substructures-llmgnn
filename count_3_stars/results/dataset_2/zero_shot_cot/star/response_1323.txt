Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, as these nodes can act as the center of a 3-star.

Nodes connected to 3 other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 4, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 1, 7, and 0
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 2
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 3, and 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 2, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 0, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 1, 2, and 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, and 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 1, 8, and 6
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 8

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars by looking at the nodes identified above and their connections.

[There are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph.] 
<5, (6, 8, 4)>
<9, (2, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (9, 6, 2)>
<3, (7, 0, 6)>
<8, (5, 1, 2)>
<6, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (9, 4, 1)>
