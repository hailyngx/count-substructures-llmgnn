Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (8, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
