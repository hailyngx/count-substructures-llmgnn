Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 5)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
