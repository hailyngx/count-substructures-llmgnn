Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 6, and 3. <1, (9, 6, 3)>
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 8. <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6. <7, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 2. <8, (6, 4, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
