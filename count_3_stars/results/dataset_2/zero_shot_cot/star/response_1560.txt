Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (11, 20) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 20) (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 15) (5, 4) (9, 0) (9, 24) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 29) (17, 8) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (29, 17) (29, 14) (15, 22) (15, 20) (15, 2) (20, 11) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 27) (26, 13) (26, 3) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 7) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 21) (19, 10) (19, 27) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 1) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 6) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 24) (1, 6) (1, 25) (1, 8) (4, 22) (4, 5) (28, 18) (28, 24) (28, 23) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 9) (24, 2) (24, 28) (24, 8) (24, 23) (25, 1) (25, 23) (25, 14) (27, 20) (27, 19) (27, 8) (27, 3) (3, 10) (3, 26) (3, 27) (14, 29) (14, 18) (14, 25) (23, 28) (23, 24) (23, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges.

Node 0: (7, 9, 16)
Node 1: (6, 8, 25)
Node 2: (12, 15, 24)
Node 3: (10, 26, 27)
Node 4: (5, 22, 28)
Node 6: (1, 7, 11)
Node 8: (1, 17, 27)
Node 10: (12, 19, 21)
Node 12: (2, 7, 10)
Node 13: (18, 22, 26)
Node 14: (18, 25, 29)
Node 15: (2, 15, 20)
Node 16: (0, 11, 20)
Node 18: (13, 14, 21)
Node 20: (11, 15, 27)
Node 22: (4, 13, 15)
Node 24: (2, 8, 23)
Node 25: (1, 14, 23)
Node 26: (3, 13, 27)
Node 27: (3, 8, 20)
Node 28: (4, 18, 23)
Node 29: (14, 17, 18)

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars: 
<0, (7, 9, 16)> 
<1, (6, 8, 25)> 
<2, (12, 15, 24)> 
<3, (10, 26, 27)> 
<4, (5, 22, 28)> 
<6, (1, 7, 11)> 
<8, (1, 17, 27)> 
<10, (12, 19, 21)> 
<12, (2, 7, 10)> 
<13, (18, 22, 26)> 
<14, (18, 25, 29)> 
<15, (2, 15, 20)> 
<16, (0, 11, 20)> 
<18, (13, 14, 21)> 
<20, (11, 15, 27)> 
<22, (4, 13, 15)> 
<24, (2, 8, 23)> 
<25, (1, 14, 23)> 
<26, (3, 13, 27)> 
<27, (3, 8, 20)> 
<28, (4, 18, 23)> 
<29, (14, 17, 18)>
