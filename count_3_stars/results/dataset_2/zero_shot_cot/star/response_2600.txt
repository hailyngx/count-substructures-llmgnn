Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 28) (6, 3) (6, 27) (6, 20) (9, 29) (9, 19) (22, 23) (22, 28) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 0) (0, 23) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 10) (20, 6) (20, 0) (20, 13) (28, 6) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 7) (28, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 4) (24, 26) (24, 27) (24, 25) (24, 21) (18, 23) (18, 26) (18, 1) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 12) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 7) (10, 0) (10, 28) (10, 2) (10, 7) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 25) (3, 6) (3, 27) (3, 4) (7, 28) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 1) (21, 24) (21, 13) (4, 2) (4, 3) (25, 24) (25, 5) (25, 19) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (16, 29) (27, 6) (27, 24) (27, 3) (27, 8) (12, 28) (12, 29) (17, 15) (11, 5) (8, 1) (8, 27) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify all the 3-stars:

<0, (2, 10, 20)>
<1, (5, 13, 18)>
<2, (0, 4, 10)>
<3, (4, 6, 27)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<5, (1, 7, 25)>
<6, (3, 6, 27)>
<7, (5, 10, 14)>
<9, (12, 19, 29)>
<10, (0, 2, 28)>
<12, (9, 27, 29)>
<13, (1, 20, 21)>
<14, (0, 7, 14)>
<15, (2, 17, 19)>
<16, (8, 27, 29)>
<17, (15, 19, 25)>
<18, (1, 23, 26)>
<19, (9, 15, 25)>
<20, (0, 13, 28)>
<21, (13, 21, 24)>
<22, (23, 28, 29)>
<23, (18, 22, 26)>
<24, (21, 24, 26)>
<25, (5, 17, 19)>
<26, (18, 24, 27)>
<27, (3, 6, 8)>
<28, (10, 20, 22)>
<29, (9, 12, 22)>

There are a total of [29] 3-stars in the given graph.
