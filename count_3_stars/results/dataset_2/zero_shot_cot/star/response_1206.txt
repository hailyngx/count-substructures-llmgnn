Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the given graph. 

From the edge list, we can see that the possible central nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (8, 4, 7)>
<3, (4, 1, 2)>
<4, (9, 7, 6)>
<5, (8, 0, 9)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<7, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
