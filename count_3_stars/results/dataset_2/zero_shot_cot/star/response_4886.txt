Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 13) (14, 17) (14, 15) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 8) (2, 15) (18, 15) (18, 11) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (4, 19) (4, 1) (4, 15) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 16) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 19) (8, 6) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 1) (16, 19) (3, 12) (3, 10) (6, 8) (6, 11) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 19) (10, 14) (10, 3) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 15) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify all possible 3-stars in the graph using the given edges:

1. Node 1: (4, 1, 7), (1, 7, 17)
2. Node 3: (10, 3, 12)
3. Node 4: (1, 4, 15), (4, 15, 19)
4. Node 5: (5, 9, 17)
5. Node 7: (0, 1, 7), (7, 8, 12)
6. Node 8: (6, 8, 19), (8, 12, 17)
7. Node 9: (5, 9, 13), (9, 13, 17)
8. Node 10: (10, 14, 15), (10, 3, 14)
9. Node 11: (0, 11, 18), (6, 11, 15)
10. Node 12: (7, 12, 13)
11. Node 13: (0, 13, 19), (9, 13, 12)
12. Node 15: (2, 15, 18), (15, 14, 4)
13. Node 17: (1, 8, 17), (5, 9, 17)
14. Node 19: (4, 15, 19), (8, 19, 13)

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:

[<4, 1, 7>, <1, 7, 17>, <10, 3, 12>, <1, 4, 15>, <4, 15, 19>, <0, 1, 7>, <7, 8, 12>, <6, 8, 19>, <8, 12, 17>, <5, 9, 17>, 
<10, 14, 15>, <10, 3, 14>, <0, 11, 18>, <6, 11, 15>, <7, 12, 13>, <0, 13, 19>, <9, 13, 12>, <2, 15, 18>, <15, 14, 4>, <1, 8, 17>]
