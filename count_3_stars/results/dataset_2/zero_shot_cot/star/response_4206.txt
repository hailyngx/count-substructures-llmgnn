Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center of a 3-star. The nodes connected to node 10 are: 0, 1, 2, 6, and 9. 

Now, we will check for each of these nodes if they satisfy the condition of forming a 3-star. We will look for sets of three nodes that are connected to node 10 and to each other.  

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<10, (0, 1, 14)>
<10, (1, 2, 8)>
<10, (2, 3, 11)>
<10, (6, 1, 9)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [4].
