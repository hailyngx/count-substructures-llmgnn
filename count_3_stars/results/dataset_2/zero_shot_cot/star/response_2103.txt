Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 9) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (8, 9, 2)>
<7, (11, 6, 10)>
<1, (5, 13, _)>
<3, (0, 14, 6)>
<8, (4, 2, 14)>
<5, (1, 6, 2)>
<6, (7, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 14, 10)>
<14, (3, 8, 12)>
<2, (4, 7, 5)>
<12, (14, 10, 11)>
<10, (7, 0, 2)>
<11, (7, 6, 0)>
<9, (4, 12, 10)>
<13, (1, 3, 9)>

There are [15] unique 3-stars in this graph.
