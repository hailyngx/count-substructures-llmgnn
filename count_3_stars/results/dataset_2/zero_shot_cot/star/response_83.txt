Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 25) (26, 14) (26, 5) (26, 21) (8, 25) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 0) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 27) (23, 11) (23, 29) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 24) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 4) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 2) (15, 20) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 2) (12, 17) (12, 28) (12, 19) (27, 22) (27, 16) (21, 26) (21, 15) (28, 12) (28, 24) (2, 20) (2, 15) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 4) (11, 23) (11, 1) (11, 3) (29, 23) (29, 20) (29, 18) (6, 8) (6, 24) (14, 26) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 1) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 3) (16, 5) (4, 22) (4, 17) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (24, 10) (24, 28) (24, 6) (5, 26) (5, 16) (5, 4) (25, 9) (25, 8) (7, 10) (7, 15) (7, 19) (19, 10) (19, 12) (19, 7) (18, 1) (18, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with degree 3 since those are potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
Nodes with degree 3: 1, 11, 12, 28

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
1. Node 1:
   - (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 14)
   <1, (17, 11, 14)>

2. Node 11:
   - (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 3)
   <11, (1, 23, 3)>

3. Node 12:
   - (12, 17) (12, 28) (12, 19)
   <12, (17, 28, 19)>

4. Node 28:
   - (28, 12) (28, 24) (28, 12)
   <28, (12, 24, 19)>
