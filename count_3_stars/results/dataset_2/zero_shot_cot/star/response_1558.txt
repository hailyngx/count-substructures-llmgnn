Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 18) (14, 17) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 13) (9, 0) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 18) (13, 6) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (0, 9) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 16) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 15) (18, 13) (19, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 19) (16, 2) (16, 19) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
  
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (11, 9, 5)>
<1, (10, 12, 2)>
<4, (10, 19, 12)>
<13, (6, 9, 18)>
