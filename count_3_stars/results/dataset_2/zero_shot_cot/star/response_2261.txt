Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star configuration. 

Let's start by listing the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: connected to nodes 2 and 3
- Node 1: connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9
- Node 2: connected to nodes 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 3: connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7
- Node 4: connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: connected to nodes 3, 4, 6, and 8
- Node 6: connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 7: connected to nodes 3, 4, 6
- Node 8: connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8

Now, let's begin identifying the unique 3-stars:

1. <0, (2, 3, 5)>
2. <1, (4, 8, 9)>
3. <2, (0, 4, 6)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 7)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 5)>
6. <5, (3, 4, 6)>
7. <6, (2, 5, 7)>
8. <7, (3, 4, 6)>
9. <8, (1, 5, 9)>
10. <9, (1, 4, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is the number of unique configurations identified, which is 10. 

Therefore, the answer is [10].
