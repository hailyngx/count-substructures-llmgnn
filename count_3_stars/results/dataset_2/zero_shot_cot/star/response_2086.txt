Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 10) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 12) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 13) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, we can determine the 3-stars with the central node and its leaf nodes. Let's find those:

<0, (7, 8, 11)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 9, 12)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<4, (3, 11, 12)>
<5, (0, 11, 12)>
<6, (1, 10, 12)>
<7, (0, 8, 13)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 14)>
<10, (6, 13, 14)>
<11, (0, 4, 5)>
<12, (2, 4, 5)>
<13, (7, 10, 12)>
<14, (9, 10, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
