Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (22, 13) (22, 20) (22, 29) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 21) (9, 13) (9, 5) (9, 28) (9, 17) (9, 16) (15, 14) (27, 12) (27, 8) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 10) (21, 5) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 11) (21, 14) (23, 17) (23, 25) (23, 12) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 23) (17, 10) (17, 1) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 27) (8, 4) (8, 29) (8, 25) (12, 27) (12, 23) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 26) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 18) (18, 4) (18, 14) (1, 17) (1, 24) (24, 1) (24, 26) (26, 5) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 29) (26, 25) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 25) (6, 10) (6, 2) (11, 7) (11, 21) (11, 2) (3, 20) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 26) (28, 9) (28, 19) (20, 22) (20, 3) (25, 23) (25, 8) (25, 26) (25, 2) (19, 7) (19, 21) (19, 28) (16, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node '13':
<13, (22, 17, 9)>
<13, (14, 22, 9)>
<13, (9, 5, 17)>
<13, (17, 23, 10)>
<13, (9, 16, 28)>
<13, (14, 21, 15)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node '22':
<22, (13, 20, 29)>
<22, (20, 29, 3)>

Identify the nodes that are connected to the central node '5':
<5, (9, 21, 26)>

Identify the nodes that are connected to the central node '9':
<9, (13, 5, 28)>
<9, (5, 17, 16)>
<9, (17, 13, 9)>
<9, (13, 9, 14)>

Identify the nodes that are connected to the central node '14':
<14, (13, 15, 21)>
<14, (15, 21, 18)>
<14, (21, 18, 14)>

Identify the nodes that are connected to the central node '17':
<17, (13, 10, 1)>
<17, (10, 1, 17)>
<17, (1, 24, 26)>
<17, (24, 26, 1)>
<17, (26, 25, 2)>
<17, (25, 2, 17)>
<17, (2, 6, 10)>
<17, (6, 10, 17)>
<17, (23, 12, 0)>
<17, (12, 0, 17)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
