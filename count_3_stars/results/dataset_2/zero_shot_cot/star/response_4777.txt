Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (14, 28) (14, 16) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 27) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 19) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 19) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 10) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 12) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 11) (20, 17) (20, 9) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 8) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 21) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 8) (19, 10) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 4) (12, 1) (12, 28) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 20) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 2) (6, 15) (6, 13) (2, 15) (2, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 11) (10, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (21, 26) (21, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Nodes with three edges (potential centers of 3-stars):
- Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 1), (3, 23)
- Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 6), (15, 4)
- Node 14: (14, 28), (14, 16)
- Node 17: (17, 20), (17, 23)
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 13), (1, 12)
- Node 0: (0, 27), (0, 29), (0, 19)
- Node 27: (27, 1), (27, 0), (27, 19)
- Node 22: (22, 23), (22, 26)
- Node 23: (23, 3), (23, 17), (23, 22)
- Node 28: (28, 14), (28, 8), (28, 12)
- Node 29: (29, 0), (29, 5), (29, 10)
- Node 26: (26, 22), (26, 23), (26, 13)
- Node 13: (13, 1), (13, 26), (13, 5)
- Node 5: (5, 29), (5, 13), (5, 11)
- Node 20: (20, 17), (20, 9)
- Node 18: (18, 26), (18, 9), (18, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 28), (8, 18)
- Node 19: (19, 0), (19, 27), (19, 8)
- Node 11: (11, 17), (11, 5), (11, 4)
- Node 12: (12, 1), (12, 28)
- Node 16: (16, 14), (16, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 20), (9, 18), (9, 16)
- Node 6: (6, 15), (6, 13)
- Node 2: (2, 15), (2, 9)

2. Unique 3-stars:
- <3, (15, 1, 23)>
- <15, (3, 6, 4)>
- <14, (28, 16)>
- <17, (20, 23)>
- <1, (3, 13, 12)>
- <0, (27, 29, 19)>
- <27, (1, 0, 19)>
- <22, (23, 26)>
- <23, (3, 17, 22)>
- <28, (14, 8, 12)>
- <29, (0, 5, 10)>
- <26, (22, 23, 13)>
- <13, (1, 26, 5)>
- <5, (29, 13, 11)>
- <20, (17, 9)>
- <18, (26, 9, 8)>
- <8, (3, 28, 18)>
- <19, (0, 27, 8)>
- <11, (17, 5, 4)>
- <12, (1, 28)>
- <16, (14, 9)>
- <9, (20, 18, 16)>
- <6, (15, 13)>
- <2, (15, 9)>
- <4, (3, 15, 11)>
- <10, (23, 29, 13)>
- <21, (26, 25)>

[The total number of 3-stars is 28.]
