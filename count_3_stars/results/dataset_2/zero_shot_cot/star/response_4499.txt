Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 0) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 15) (18, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 2) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 19) (0, 17) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (8, 15) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 1) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 16) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 16) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 10) (16, 19) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 14) (10, 19) (10, 6) (10, 16) (2, 15) (2, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Those nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. 

- Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes: 11, 9, 5, and 12.
- Node 15 is connected to 3 other nodes: 18, 8, and 2.
- Node 14 is connected to 3 other nodes: 17, 6, and 10.
- Node 17 is connected to 3 other nodes: 14, 1, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes: 12, 5, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to 3 other nodes: 17, 7, and 13.
- Node 19 is connected to 3 other nodes: 1, 8, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes: 3, 13, and 16.
- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes: 3, 7, 11, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes: 14, 4, and 10.
- Node 16 is connected to 3 other nodes: 19, 9, and 10.
- Node 10 is connected to 4 other nodes: 14, 19, 6, and 16.

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:

<3, (11, 9, 5)>
<15, (18, 8, 2)>
<14, (17, 6, 10)>
<17, (1, 14, 0)>
<7, (12, 5, 1)>
<1, (17, 7, 13)>
<19, (1, 8, 10)>
<9, (3, 13, 16)>
<5, (3, 7, 11)>
<6, (14, 4, 10)>
<16, (19, 9, 10)>
<10, (14, 19, 6)>

Finally, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [12].
