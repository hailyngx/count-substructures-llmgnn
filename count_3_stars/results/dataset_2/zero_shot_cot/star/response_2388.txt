Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 14, and 7: <6, (5, 14, 7)>
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 10: <9, (4, 11, 10)>
3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 0: <1, (3, 5, 0)>
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 12: <3, (11, 7, 12)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 5, and 14: <8, (13, 5, 14)>
6. Node 13 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 2: <13, (10, 8, 2)>
7. Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 4: <5, (6, 1, 4)>
8. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 11: <0, (1, 14, 11)>
9. Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 0: <14, (6, 8, 0)>
10. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 10, and 4: <2, (6, 10, 4)>
11. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 12: <7, (6, 1, 12)>
12. Node 12 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 7: <12, (3, 8, 7)>
13. Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 10, and 2: <4, (9, 10, 2)>

By listing all the unique 3-stars found in the given graph, we find a total of [13] 3-stars.
