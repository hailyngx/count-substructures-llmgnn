Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 6, 11)>
<3, (1, 7, 10)>
<3, (5, 6, 10)>
<5, (3, 6, 11)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (4, 0, 10)>
<9, (0, 13, 14)>
<13, (2, 11, 14)>
<13, (7, 9, 14)>
<13, (0, 11, 14)>
<14, (8, 9, 12)>
<14, (10, 13, 12)>
<14, (13, 9, 7)>
