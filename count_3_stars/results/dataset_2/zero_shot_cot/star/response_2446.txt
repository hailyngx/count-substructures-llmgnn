Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. The nodes that are directly connected to 3 other nodes are the potential central nodes for 3-stars. 

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
Node 0: 2
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 3
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 2
Node 8: 4
Node 9: 2
Node 10: 3
Node 11: 4
Node 12: 3
Node 13: 4
Node 14: 2
Node 15: 2
Node 16: 3
Node 17: 3
Node 18: 3
Node 19: 3
Node 20: 3
Node 21: 3
Node 22: 5
Node 23: 4
Node 24: 4
Node 25: 3
Node 26: 3
Node 27: 2
Node 28: 4
Node 29: 3

The nodes with degree 3 or more that are connected to 3 other nodes are nodes: 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 28. 
Let's check if each of these nodes forms a 3-star.

Now, let's count the 3-stars in the graph by considering each of these nodes as the potential center. 

Let's start with node 1:
Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 11, and 13. 
However, there are no 3-stars centered at node 1, as none of the nodes 2, 11, or 13 are directly connected.

Moving on to node 2:
Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 18, and 20.
There is a 3-star centered at node 2: <2, (1, 18, 20)>.

Continuing in this manner, we check each of the potential central nodes until we have considered all possibilities. 

After examining all potential central nodes, we find that there is only one 3-star in this graph:
