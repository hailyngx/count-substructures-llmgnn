Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph will have degree 3, and the leaves will all have degree 1. 
Let's look for all possible 3-stars:

1. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 5, 6, 1

2. Central node: 2
   Leaves: 9, 6, 4

3. Central node: 3
   Leaves: 6, 4, 7

4. Central node: 4
   Leaves: 5, 7, 2

5. Central node: 5
   Leaves: 9, 6, 4

6. Central node: 6
   Leaves: 5, 9, 7

7. Central node: 7
   Leaves: 9, 6, 4

8. Central node: 9
   Leaves: 5, 6, 7

9. Central node: 0
   Leaves: 1, 3, 8
