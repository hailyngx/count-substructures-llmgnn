Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 16) (9, 10) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 16) (17, 5) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 4) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 4) (15, 16) (2, 1) (2, 19) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 7) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 18) (7, 0) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (10, 9) (10, 4) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 5) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 12) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (11, 8) (11, 4) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 12) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars. 

From the given edges, the nodes that satisfy this condition are: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<3, (6, 7, 15)>
<4, (10, 11, 15)>
<5, (16, 17, 18)>
<6, (3, 8, 17)>
<7, (0, 9, 18)>
<9, (7, 10, 14)>
<14, (9, 17, 18)>
<15, (3, 4, 18)>
<16, (5, 12, 14)>
<17, (6, 14, 4)>
<18, (15, 14, 5)>
<19, (2, 12, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
