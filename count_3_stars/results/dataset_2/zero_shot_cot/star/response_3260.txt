Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 18) (9, 20) (26, 9) (26, 23) (26, 17) (1, 15) (21, 3) (21, 13) (21, 8) (21, 5) (3, 21) (3, 11) (3, 20) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 0) (11, 3) (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 22) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 21) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 28) (2, 27) (2, 7) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 17) (6, 4) (6, 14) (28, 8) (28, 0) (22, 9) (22, 16) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 10) (5, 21) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 17) (13, 21) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 26) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (14, 6) (14, 20) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 29) (10, 0) (10, 29) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 25) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 24) (7, 27) (24, 7) (24, 27) (29, 23) (29, 10) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 18) (27, 2) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 20) (20, 9) (20, 3) (20, 14) (20, 27) (25, 19) (25, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3 (as these could potentially be central nodes of 3-stars):
   - Node 9 has degree 4
   - Node 26 has degree 4
   - Node 1 has degree 2
   - Node 21 has degree 4
   - Node 3 has degree 4
   - Node 15 has degree 4
   - Node 11 has degree 4
   - Node 16 has degree 4
   - Node 4 has degree 3
   - Node 8 has degree 4
   - Node 2 has degree 2
   - Node 19 has degree 4
   - Node 6 has degree 2
   - Node 28 has degree 3
   - Node 22 has degree 4
   - Node 0 has degree 4
   - Node 5 has degree 4
   - Node 13 has degree 4
   - Node 17 has degree 5
   - Node 14 has degree 2
   - Node 23 has degree 4
   - Node 10 has degree 2
   - Node 18 has degree 4
   - Node 7 has degree 4
   - Node 24 has degree 3
   - Node 29 has degree 3
   - Node 12 has degree 4
   - Node 27 has degree 4
   - Node 20 has degree 4
   - Node 25 has degree 2

2. None of the nodes have degree exactly 3, indicating that there are no central nodes for 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph. 

The final answer is: [0]
