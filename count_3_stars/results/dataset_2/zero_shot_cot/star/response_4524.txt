Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 17) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 17) (17, 13) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (16, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 10) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 11) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 3) (7, 15) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <8, (2, 9, 16)>
2. <13, (17, 8, 15)>
3. <5, (19, 11, 4)>
4. <5, (19, 11, 3)>
5. <6, (4, 5, 8)>
6. <19, (5, 7, 11)>
7. <9, (17, 18, 8)>
8. <17, (13, 9, 15)>
9. <17, (0, 15, 12)>
10. <0, (17, 18, 1)>
11. <16, (8, 15, 2)>
12. <11, (5, 1, 18)>
13. <14, (3, 10, 18)>
14. <3, (5, 2, 7)>
15. <7, (19, 15, 3)>
16. <1, (0, 11, 12)>
17. <4, (5, 6, 8)>
18. <12, (17, 11, 1)>
19. <10, (2, 14, 18)>

Count the total number of 3-stars: [19]
