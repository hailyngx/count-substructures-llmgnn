Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 1) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 19) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 0) (15, 10) (0, 9) (0, 16) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 0) (18, 9) (18, 17) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 19) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 12) (14, 5) (14, 6) (19, 3) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 19) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 10, 11, and 12 (degree = 4).
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8, 9, 16 (degree = 4).
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 11, 13, 19 (degree = 4).
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 16, 17 (degree = 2).
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 14 (degree = 3).
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 11 (degree = 2).
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 10 (degree = 2).
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 17 (degree = 2).
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 16 (degree = 2).

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:
<2, (5, 8, 16)>
<3, (8, 11, 13)>
<5, (1, 12, 14)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<12, (1, 6, 19)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [5] 3-stars.
