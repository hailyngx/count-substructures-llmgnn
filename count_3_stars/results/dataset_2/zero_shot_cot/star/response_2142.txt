Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 11) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 5) (4, 0) (4, 13) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 11, 12)>
<9, (6, 8, 0)>
<1, (3, 14, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 14)>
