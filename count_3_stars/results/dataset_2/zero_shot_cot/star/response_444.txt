Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (21, 19) (0, 27) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 29) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (22, 0) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 19) (8, 23) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 25) (6, 2) (28, 3) (28, 10) (28, 2) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 29) (26, 12) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 11) (3, 23) (3, 28) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (10, 28) (15, 4) (15, 17) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 29) (9, 25) (29, 27) (29, 26) (29, 9) (16, 4) (16, 19) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (13, 4) (13, 20) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 28) (2, 26) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 18) (12, 26) (12, 18) (18, 5) (18, 14) (18, 25) (18, 12) (18, 20) (24, 19) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 16) (19, 25) (19, 24) (20, 13) (20, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<0, (27, 22, 23)>
<3, (11, 28, 9)>
<5, (7, 6, 14)>
<9, (17, 29, 25)>
<11, (1, 17, 14)>
<15, (4, 17, 19)>
<18, (5, 14, 25)>
<19, (21, 23, 24)>
<20, (13, 18, 0)>
<22, (0, 23, 26)>
<26, (22, 29, 12)>
<28, (2, 3, 10)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
