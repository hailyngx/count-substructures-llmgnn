Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Let's identify the 3-stars:

<2, (9, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 13)>
<4, (5, 6, 13)>
<5, (3, 9, 10)>
<6, (3, 5, 13)>
<7, (0, 9, 11)>
<8, (0, 2, 11)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
<10, (5, 10, 14)>
<11, (0, 7, 14)>
<12, (1, 10, 12)>
<13, (3, 4, 6)>
<14, (4, 10, 11)>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
