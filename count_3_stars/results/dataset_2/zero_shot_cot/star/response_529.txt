Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 8) (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 11) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 10) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 17) (0, 15) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 13) (17, 6) (17, 18) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 19) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 19) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 12) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 8) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (8, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges.
1. Node 3 has edges to nodes 1, 11, and 18.
2. Node 15 has edges to nodes 0, 8, and 16.
3. Node 6 has edges to nodes 7, 13, and 17.
4. Node 9 has edges to nodes 2, 4, and 11.
5. Node 2 has edges to nodes 5, 9, and 18.
6. Node 18 has edges to nodes 2, 3, and 16.
7. Node 0 has edges to nodes 5, 8, and 15.
8. Node 14 has edges to nodes 0, 4, and 13.
9. Node 17 has edges to nodes 6, 18, and 19.
10. Node 5 has edges to nodes 0, 2, and 19.
11. Node 19 has edges to nodes 5, 7, and 16.
12. Node 16 has edges to nodes 10, 15, and 18.
13. Node 4 has edges to nodes 9, 12, and 14.
14. Node 12 has edges to nodes 4, 8, and 18.
15. Node 7 has edges to nodes 6, 13, and 19.

Step 2: Identify the 3-stars.
1. <3, (1, 11, 18)>
2. <15, (0, 8, 16)>
3. <6, (7, 13, 17)>
4. <9, (2, 4, 11)>
5. <2, (5, 9, 18)>
6. <18, (2, 3, 16)>
7. <0, (5, 8, 15)>
8. <14, (4, 13, 0)>
9. <17, (6, 18, 19)>
10. <5, (0, 2, 19)>
11. <19, (7, 5, 16)>
12. <16, (10, 15, 18)>
13. <4, (9, 12, 14)>
14. <12, (4, 8, 18)>
15. <7, (6, 13, 19)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
