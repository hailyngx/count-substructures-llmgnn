Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 1: <5, (9, 8, 1)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 2: <9, (5, 6, 2)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 6: <8, (5, 7, 6)>
4. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 0: <1, (5, 7, 0)>
5. Node 4 does not form any 3-star as it does not connect to exactly three other nodes.
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 1: <7, (4, 3, 1)>
7. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 3, and 8: <6, (9, 3, 8)>
8. Node 2 does not form any 3-star as it does not connect to exactly three other nodes.
9. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 8: <0, (5, 4, 8)>
10. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 4, and 7: <3, (5, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
