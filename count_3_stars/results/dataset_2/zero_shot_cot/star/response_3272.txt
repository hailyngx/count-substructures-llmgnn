Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 25) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 27) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 18) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 22) (27, 17) (27, 12) (5, 19) (5, 10) (6, 3) (7, 17) (7, 12) (7, 29) (22, 12) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 29) (26, 3) (26, 4) (0, 17) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 24) (24, 19) (24, 2) (11, 12) (11, 19) (11, 23) (11, 4) (23, 11) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 10) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 28) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 23) (29, 9) (3, 6) (3, 26) (3, 28) (28, 9) (28, 3) (28, 15) (1, 23) (1, 16) (1, 10) (20, 2) (21, 14) (21, 18) (2, 24) (2, 9) (2, 20) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (16, 15) (10, 5) (10, 23) (10, 1) (10, 16) (25, 14) (25, 12) (25, 18) (4, 26) (4, 11) (4, 15) (15, 13) (15, 28) (15, 16) (15, 4) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 25) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. Look for nodes with three edges connected to them.
2. Form a 3-star by considering the central node and its three connected nodes.

After examining the graph, we have found the following unique 3-stars:

<7, (17, 12, 29)>
<12, (27, 7, 25)>
<13, (17, 8, 15)>
<15, (13, 4, 28)>
<16, (8, 1, 10)>
<17, (14, 13, 27)>
<18, (13, 21, 25)>
<19, (5, 11, 24)>
<21, (14, 18, 14)>
<22, (12, 26, 4)>
<23, (11, 1, 29)>
<25, (14, 12, 18)>
<26, (22, 29, 4)>
<28, (9, 15, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
The total number of 3-stars: [14]
