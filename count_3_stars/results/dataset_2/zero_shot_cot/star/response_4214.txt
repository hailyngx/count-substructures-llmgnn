Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <4, (7, 9, 6)>
2. <7, (4, 3, 5)>
3. <1, (6, 2, 5)>
4. <3, (7, 6, 0)>
5. <6, (4, 1, 3)>
6. <9, (4, 7, 6)>
7. <8, (4, 1, 2)>
8. <5, (7, 1, 3)>
9. <2, (1, 3, 8)>
10. <0, (4, 3, 2)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
