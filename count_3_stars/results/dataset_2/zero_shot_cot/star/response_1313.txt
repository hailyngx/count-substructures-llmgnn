Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each other:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7, 1, 8, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 3, 6, 5, 9, and 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 9, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 2, 8, and 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, 9, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 0, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, and 8.

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- <0, (7, 1, 8)>  (Center 0)
- <1, (4, 3, 6)>  (Center 1)
- <6, (1, 3, 8)>  (Center 6)
- <7, (4, 9, 5)>  (Center 7)
- <8, (3, 9, 0)>  (Center 8)
- <9, (4, 1, 2)>  (Center 9)

Count the number of 3-stars: 
[6]
