Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can see the following 3-star configurations:
- Node 4 as the center with leaves 1, 3, and 9
- Node 7 as the center with leaves 0, 6, and 5
- Node 1 as the center with leaves 4, 3, and 5
- Node 6 as the center with leaves 7, 9, and 5

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars. 

The unique 3-stars are <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 5)>, <1, (4, 3, 5)>, and <6, (7, 9, 5)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
