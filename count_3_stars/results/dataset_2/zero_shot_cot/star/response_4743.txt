Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which would be potential centers of 3-stars.
Nodes with 3 connections: {7, 8}

Now, we can find all possible 3-stars in the graph:
<7, (8, 0, 3)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
