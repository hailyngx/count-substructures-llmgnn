Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 12) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 5) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (4, 11) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 15) (12, 14) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 4) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 14) (19, 18) (0, 15) (0, 18) (10, 4) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 5) (5, 17) (5, 1) (2, 7) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars. 
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 19, and 4.
- Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 1, and 3.
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 13, and 9.
- Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 12.
- Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 12, and 19.
- Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 12, and 5.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 17, and 9.
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 14, and 6.
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 16, 13, and 18.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 8, and 12.
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes 11, 9, and 13 and another with nodes 12, 4, and 10.
- Node 12 forms two 3-stars: one with nodes 15, 14, and 17 and another with nodes 13, 4, and 12.
- Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 19, and 0.
- Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 14, and 18.
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 18, and itself.

Now count the total number of 3-stars: <11, (16, 19, 4)>, <16, (11, 1, 3)>, <3, (16, 13, 9)>, <15, (0, 6, 12)>, <14, (9, 12, 19)>, <17, (6, 12, 5)>, <6, (15, 17, 9)>, <9, (3, 14, 6)>, <8, (16, 13, 18)>, <13, (3, 8, 12)>, <4, (11, 9, 13)>, <4, (12, 4, 10)>, <12, (15, 14, 17)>, <12, (13, 4, 12)>, <18, (8, 19, 0)>, <19, (11, 14, 18)>, <0, (15, 18, 0)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16].
