Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 23) (27, 17) (3, 2) (3, 19) (25, 9) (25, 15) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 16) (10, 21) (10, 16) (10, 29) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 26) (7, 13) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 9) (21, 10) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 8) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 17) (15, 25) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 28) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 4) (26, 11) (26, 28) (26, 4) (28, 15) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 20) (5, 24) (5, 14) (19, 3) (19, 29) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 28) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 1) (29, 10) (29, 19) (4, 20) (4, 26) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 2) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 24) (14, 23) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (24, 0) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 6) (8, 21) (8, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the structures where a central node is connected to exactly three nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars below before counting them:

<0, (13, 24, 23)>
<1, (2, 28, 9)>
<2, (3, 18, 1)>
<3, (2, 19, 29)>
<4, (20, 26, 12)>
<5, (24, 14, 5)>
<6, (7, 24, 6)>
<7, (13, 21, 6)>
<8, (21, 1, 8)>
<9, (25, 15, 1)>
<10, (21, 16, 29)>
<11, (14, 24, 11)>
<12, (13, 4, 12)>
<14, (23, 18, 5)>
<15, (25, 17, 20)>
<16, (23, 10, 28)>
<17, (27, 18, 15)>
<18, (2, 16, 17)>
<19, (3, 29, 19)>
<20, (15, 4, 17)>
<21, (10, 7, 8)>
<23, (0, 16, 14)>
<24, (11, 5, 6)>
<25, (9, 15, 25)>
<26, (28, 4, 26)>
<27, (17, 27, 0)>
<28, (15, 26, 1)>
<29, (10, 19, 29)>

Now, counting the number of 3-stars based on the listed unique combinations gives us a total of [29] 3-stars in the graph.
