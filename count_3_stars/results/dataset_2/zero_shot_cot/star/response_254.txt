Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's examine each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star will have the center connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 0 has degree 5, not a center of a 3-star.
2. Node 1 has degree 3, could be a center of a 3-star.
3. Node 2 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star.
4. Node 3 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star.
5. Node 4 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star.
6. Node 5 has degree 5, not a center of a 3-star.
7. Node 6 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star.
8. Node 7 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star.
9. Node 8 has degree 3, could be a center of a 3-star.
10. Node 9 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star.
11. Node 10 has degree 4, not a center of a 3-star.
12. Node 11 has degree 3, could be a center of a 3-star.
13. Node 12 has degree 5, not a center of a 3-star.
14. Node 13 has degree 3, could be a center of a 3-star.
15. Node 14 has degree 5, not a center of a 3-star.

The possible centers for 3-stars are nodes 1, 8, 11, and 13. Now, let's verify the connections of leaves for each potential center.

For node 1: Possible 3-star <1, (10, 11, 14)>
For node 8: Possible 3-star <8, (0, 3, 10)>
For node 11: Possible 3-star <11, (1, 12, 14)>
For node 13: Possible 3-star <13, (6, 10, 12)>

There are multiple instances of each possible 3-star, so we need to count the unique occurrences: 
- <1, (10, 11, 14)> appears twice
- <8, (0, 3, 10)> appears once
- <11, (1, 12, 14)> appears once
- <13, (6, 10, 12)> appears once

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
