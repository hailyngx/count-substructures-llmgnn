Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 18) (14, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 12) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. For a node to be the center of a 3-star, it must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all such nodes:

- Node 5 is connected to 4 other nodes (9, 6, 1, 11)
- Node 9 is connected to 3 other nodes (5, 18, 2)
- Node 11 is connected to 4 other nodes (5, 10, 8, 15)
- Node 8 is connected to 3 other nodes (11, 13, 19)
- Node 18 is connected to 5 other nodes (9, 14, 15, 12, 3)
- Node 4 is connected to 3 other nodes (14, 2, 1)
- Node 1 is connected to 2 other nodes (5, 4)
- Node 6 is connected to 3 other nodes (5, 7, 0)
- Node 2 is connected to 3 other nodes (9, 4, 0)
- Node 13 is connected to 3 other nodes (8, 16, 19)
- Node 7 is connected to 3 other nodes (6, 16, 3)
- Node 16 is connected to 3 other nodes (10, 13, 7)
- Node 3 is connected to 4 other nodes (19, 7, 18, 4)
- Node 12 is connected to 3 other nodes (15, 18, 19)

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph. We will consider all combinations of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here is the count:

Total number of 3-stars: 6

<5, (9, 6, 1)>  
<9, (5, 18, 2)>  
<11, (10, 8, 15)>
