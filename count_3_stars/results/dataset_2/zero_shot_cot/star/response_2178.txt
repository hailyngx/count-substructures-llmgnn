Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 19) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 1) (5, 14) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 13) (13, 3) (13, 5) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (19, 11) (19, 18) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 19) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 15) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with exactly 3 connections:

- Node 0: connected to nodes 14, 7, 2
- Node 1: connected to nodes 7, 4, 12
- Node 2: connected to nodes 17, 0, 8
- Node 3: connected to nodes 6, 11, 16
- Node 4: connected to nodes 17, 12, 1
- Node 5: connected to nodes 14, 8, 3
- Node 7: connected to nodes 0, 16, 1
- Node 8: connected to nodes 2, 5, 11 
- Node 10: connected to nodes 6, 15, 18
- Node 12: connected to nodes 9, 4, 1
- Node 14: connected to nodes 17, 0, 5 
- Node 15: connected to nodes 10, 18, 16
- Node 16: connected to nodes 3, 7, 15 
- Node 17: connected to nodes 6, 14, 2
- Node 18: connected to nodes 10, 15, 19
- Node 19: connected to nodes 11 , 18 

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

- <0, (14, 7, 2)>
- <1, (4, 12, 7)>
- <2, (17, 0, 8)>
- <3, (6, 11, 16)>
- <4, (17, 12, 1)>
- <5, (14, 8, 3)>
- <7, (0, 16, 1)>
- <8, (2, 5, 11)>
- <10, (6, 15, 18)>
- <12, (9, 4, 1)>
- <14, (17, 0, 5)>
- <15, (10, 18, 16)>
- <16, (3, 7, 15)>
- <17, (6, 14, 2)>
- <18, (10, 15, 19)>
- <19, (11, 18)>

Now count the number of unique 3-stars: [16]
