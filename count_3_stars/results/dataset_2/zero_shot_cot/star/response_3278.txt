Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 8) (9, 11) (26, 9) (26, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (22, 8) (23, 21) (23, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 2) (17, 1) (17, 24) (15, 25) (15, 12) (15, 28) (20, 3) (20, 8) (20, 28) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 21) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 29) (7, 1) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 19) (13, 26) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 16) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 3) (8, 9) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 21) (16, 1) (16, 28) (16, 27) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 2) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 27) (4, 21) (27, 10) (27, 16) (27, 19) (27, 24) (29, 7) (29, 6) (29, 24) (11, 9) (11, 18) (6, 23) (6, 29) (6, 25) (6, 2) (24, 17) (24, 27) (24, 29) (24, 21) (3, 5) (3, 20) (3, 18) (3, 19) (25, 15) (25, 6) (25, 2) (2, 10) (2, 28) (2, 6) (2, 25) (21, 23) (21, 14) (21, 8) (21, 4) (21, 24) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (14, 21, 7)>
<1, (17, 16, 7)>
<2, (10, 25, 6)>
<3, (5, 18, 19)>
<6, (23, 25, 29)>
<7, (5, 0, 12)>
<8, (22, 20, 21)>
<9, (26, 11, 8)>
<11, (9, 18, 11)>
<12, (15, 7, 19)>
<13, (26, 0, 13)>
<16, (1, 27, 16)>
<17, (1, 24, 17)>
<18, (10, 3, 11)>
<19, (12, 3, 27)>
<20, (28, 3, 8)>
<21, (23, 14, 4)>
<24, (17, 27, 29)>
<25, (15, 2, 6)>
<26, (9, 13, 0)>
<27, (10, 16, 24)>
<28, (15, 20, 16)>
<29, (7, 6, 24)>

There are [23] 3-stars in the given graph.
