Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 17) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 14) (2, 8) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 1) (18, 3) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 19) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 17) (3, 18) (1, 18) (1, 10) (19, 0) (19, 17) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 7) (17, 19) (4, 10) (4, 15) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 4) (12, 13) (12, 14) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (14, 9) (14, 18) (14, 13) (14, 12) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes would be at the center of the 3-star configurations.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 6, 9, 0, 7, 3, 1, and 19.

Next, we identify the 3-star configurations using these central nodes and count the number of unique 3-stars.

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<6, (16, 9, 15)>
<9, (6, 8, 15)>
<0, (8, 7, 19)>
<7, (5, 17, 0)>
<3, (18, 1, 19)>
<1, (18, 10, 13)>
<19, (0, 17, 1)>

So, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
