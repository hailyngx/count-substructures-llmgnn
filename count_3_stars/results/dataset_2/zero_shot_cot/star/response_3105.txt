Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 18) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 15) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 18) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 5) (18, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (9, 18) (9, 19) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 13) (1, 4) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 15) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the node with the highest degree. In this case, node 18 has the highest degree (degree = 4), so we will find the nodes that are connected to it.

Nodes connected to node 18: 4, 7, 5, 9

Now, let's identify the 3-stars that have node 18 as the center:
<18, (4, 7, 5)>
<18, (4, 7, 9)>

Next, we will find the nodes that are connected to the node with the second highest degree, which is node 12.

Nodes connected to node 12: 7, 10, 15, 13

Now, let's identify the 3-stars that have node 12 as the center:
<12, (7, 10, 15)>
<12, (7, 10, 13)>

Finally, we will find the nodes that are connected to the node with the third highest degree, which is node 6.

Nodes connected to node 6: 5, 14, 8, 13

Now, let's identify the 3-stars that have node 6 as the center:
<6, (5, 14, 8)>
<6, (5, 14, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4.
