Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 21) (27, 18) (27, 20) (10, 15) (17, 20) (8, 23) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (23, 8) (23, 3) (23, 13) (23, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 25) (2, 4) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 21) (26, 22) (26, 5) (28, 15) (20, 27) (20, 17) (20, 18) (20, 9) (16, 12) (16, 18) (5, 26) (19, 6) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 21) (29, 6) (29, 14) (29, 11) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 19) (6, 29) (6, 1) (18, 15) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 16) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 14) (0, 15) (0, 24) (3, 8) (3, 23) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 24) (7, 3) (7, 13) (14, 8) (14, 29) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 25) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 24) (21, 25) (11, 22) (11, 29) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 14) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (25, 2) (25, 14) (25, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying all such 3-stars.

The 3-stars in the given graph are:
<15, (27, 10, 0)>
<27, (15, 21, 18)>
<10, (15, 17, 1)>
<8, (23, 14, 12)>
<23, (8, 3, 13)>
<2, (1, 3, 25)>
<22, (26, 11, 21)>
<26, (22, 5, 2)>
<28, (15, 20, 27)>
<20, (27, 17, 9)>
<16, (12, 18, 8)>
<5, (26, 22, 6)>
<19, (6, 29, 1)>
<9, (23, 20, 21)>
<29, (6, 14, 11)>
<24, (0, 7, 21)>
<1, (2, 6, 4)>
<6, (19, 29, 1)>
<18, (15, 27, 20)>
<12, (8, 16, 14)>
<0, (15, 24, 7)>
<3, (8, 23, 2)>
<7, (24, 3, 13)>
<14, (8, 29, 12)>
<21, (27, 22, 9)>
<11, (22, 29, 1)>
<13, (23, 7, 14)>
<4, (2, 1, 3)>
<25, (2, 14, 21)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
