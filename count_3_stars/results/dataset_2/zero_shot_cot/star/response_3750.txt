Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 9) (18, 16) (17, 3) (17, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 6) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 19) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 13) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 14) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes which are connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star pattern. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

The nodes with three connections are:
- Node 0 (connected to 7, 8, 19)
- Node 2 (connected to 7, 12, 6)
- Node 6 (connected to 10, 16, 2)
- Node 7 (connected to 1, 0, 2)
- Node 8 (connected to 17, 0, 14)
- Node 12 (connected to 3, 4, 19)
- Node 13 (connected to 3, 0, 14)
- Node 15 (connected to 10, 19, 11)
- Node 16 (connected to 18, 7, 9)
- Node 19 (connected to 0, 15, 12)

Now, let's find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (7, 8, 19)>
<2, (7, 12, 6)>
<6, (10, 16, 2)>
<7, (1, 0, 2)>
<8, (17, 0, 14)>
<12, (3, 4, 19)>
<13, (3, 0, 14)>
<15, (10, 19, 11)>
<16, (18, 7, 9)>
<19, (0, 15, 12)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
