Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 8) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 10) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph by identifying the central node and its connected leaves.

We find the following 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 6, 11)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<7, (9, 4, 12)>
<6, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (11, 10, -)>
<3, (4, 6, 13)>
<2, (8, 11, 12)>
<8, (6, 3, 14)>
<12, (4, 7, 2)>
<0, (9, 6, 13)>
<10, (1, 8, 13)>
<11, (5, 1, 2)>
<14, (5, 8, 10)>
<13, (4, 3, 0)>

So, we have found 14 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
