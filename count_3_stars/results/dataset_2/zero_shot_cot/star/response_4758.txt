Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:
<5, (8, 0, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 2)>
<6, (9, 1, 3)>
<4, (9, 7, 8)>
<7, (5, 4, 1)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (6, 4, 0)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (9, 4, 0)>

There are 10 unique 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
