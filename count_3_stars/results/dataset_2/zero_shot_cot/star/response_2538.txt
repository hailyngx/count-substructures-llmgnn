Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 20) (6, 13) (6, 21) (9, 2) (9, 15) (1, 7) (3, 28) (3, 20) (3, 16) (14, 21) (17, 13) (17, 25) (21, 6) (21, 14) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 3) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 15) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 26) (11, 15) (18, 21) (18, 26) (18, 20) (18, 0) (26, 11) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 8) (7, 1) (7, 11) (25, 17) (25, 24) (23, 11) (23, 2) (23, 0) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 10) (19, 4) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 11) (2, 9) (2, 23) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 27) (12, 28) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 24) (10, 26) (10, 8) (10, 27) (10, 4) (10, 29) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 24) (24, 25) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 5) (4, 19) (4, 10) (29, 10) (29, 0) (0, 18) (0, 23) (0, 29) (20, 22) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 16) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 20) (27, 28) (27, 2) (27, 10) 

Response:
There are 12 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Here, I will list them for you:

<6, (13, 21, 28)>
<9, (2, 15, 28)>
<11, (7, 15, 26)>
<15, (9, 28, 11)>
<18, (21, 20, 26)>
<20, (22, 3, 16)>
<21, (6, 14, 28)>
<22, (13, 16, 20)>
<24, (25, 8, 12)>
<26, (11, 18, 10)>
<27, (28, 2, 10)>
<28, (3, 21, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
