Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 14) (13, 0) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 10) (22, 3) (9, 26) (9, 25) (9, 20) (9, 1) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 10) (26, 2) (26, 3) (14, 13) (14, 17) (17, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (2, 26) (2, 29) (2, 20) (29, 2) (29, 3) (8, 28) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 20) (1, 25) (4, 16) (4, 20) (27, 11) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 21) (15, 23) (16, 4) (16, 21) (16, 7) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 21) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 11) (12, 24) (12, 0) (12, 19) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 11) (21, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 19) (19, 22) (19, 12) (19, 7) (19, 25) (28, 8) (28, 0) (28, 10) (10, 22) (10, 26) (10, 28) (3, 22) (3, 26) (3, 29) (6, 22) (6, 17) (24, 12) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 19) (25, 18) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 1) (20, 4) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 21) (0, 28) (18, 25) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<9, (26, 1, 7)>
<26, (9, 22, 3)>
<22, (19, 6, 10)>
<13, (5, 17, 14)>
<2, (26, 29, 20)>
<8, (28, 1, 7)>
<4, (16, 20, 21)>
<5, (13, 23, 21)>
<11, (27, 23, 21)>
<12, (24, 0, 19)>
<28, (8, 0, 10)>
<16, (4, 21, 7)>
<15, (23, 5, 0)>
<24, (12, 0, 19)>
<6, (22, 17, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
