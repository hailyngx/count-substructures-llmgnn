Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 17) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 15) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 1) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 18) (3, 5) (14, 6) (14, 16) (14, 5) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 19) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) (16, 10) (16, 14) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 6) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 1) (15, 4) (15, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the nodes with exactly three adjacent edges, as these nodes would be the centers of the 3-stars. Then, for each of these nodes, we check if the three adjacent nodes connected to the center form a 3-star. 

1. Node 8 is the center of a 3-star: <8, (4, 9, 0)>
2. Node 13 is the center of a 3-star: <13, (17, 12, 7)>
3. Node 10 is the center of a 3-star: <10, (11, 9, 16)>
4. Node 4 is the center of a 3-star: <4, (8, 9, 19)>
5. Node 2 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 4 adjacent edges.
6. Node 18 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 3 adjacent edges but not in the form of a 3-star.
7. Node 0 is the center of a 3-star: <0, (8, 12, 1)>
8. Node 7 is the center of a 3-star: <7, (13, 17, 19)>
9. Node 9 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 4 adjacent edges.
10. Node 3 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 1 adjacent edge.
11. Node 14 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 3 adjacent edges but not in the form of a 3-star.
12. Node 6 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 3 adjacent edges but not in the form of a 3-star.
13. Node 1 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 3 adjacent edges but not in the form of a 3-star.
14. Node 16 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 2 adjacent edges.
15. Node 19 is the center of a 3-star: <19, (4, 2, 7)>
16. Node 12 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 3 adjacent edges but not in the form of a 3-star.
17. Node 5 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 3 adjacent edges but not in the form of a 3-star.
18. Node 15 is not the center of a 3-star as it has 2 adjacent edges.

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Unique 3-stars found: 
<8, (4, 9, 0)>
<13, (17, 12, 7)>
<10, (11, 9, 16)>
<0, (8, 12, 1)>
<19, (4, 2, 7)>
