Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 28) (1, 9) (3, 19) (22, 11) (22, 5) (22, 29) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 9) (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 2) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 16) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 11) (28, 1) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 27) (28, 12) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 2) (20, 23) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 9) (20, 6) (7, 0) (7, 28) (7, 10) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 24) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (25, 21) (27, 28) (27, 21) (27, 18) (6, 1) (6, 23) (6, 8) (6, 20) (5, 22) (5, 16) (5, 11) (5, 21) (10, 7) (21, 13) (21, 25) (21, 27) (21, 5) (21, 29) (24, 17) (24, 15) (24, 4) (18, 27) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (4, 16) (4, 24) (9, 1) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 15) (12, 14) (12, 28) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 5) (29, 22) (29, 14) (29, 21) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that form a 3-star in the given graph:

1. Node 1 has edges connecting to nodes 6, 28, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <1, (6, 28, 9)>
2. Node 13 has edges connecting to nodes 8, 21, and 2. This forms a 3-star: <13, (8, 21, 2)>
3. Node 14 has edges connecting to nodes 19, 29, and 16. This forms a 3-star: <14, (19, 29, 16)>
4. Node 28 has edges connecting to nodes 1, 26, and 7. This forms a 3-star: <28, (1, 26, 7)>
5. Node 4 has edges connecting to nodes 16, 24, and 9. This forms a 3-star: <4, (16, 24, 9)>
6. Node 11 has edges connecting to nodes 22, 26, and 5. This forms a 3-star: <11, (22, 26, 5)>

Count of 3-stars: [6]
