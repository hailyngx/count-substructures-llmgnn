Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 13) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Look for nodes with exactly three incident edges:
- Node 1 has 4 incident edges and is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 incident edges and is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 5 incident edges.
- Node 8 has 5 incident edges.
- Node 2 has 4 incident edges and is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 incident edges and is not part of a 3-star.
- Node 13 has 6 incident edges.
- Node 12 has 5 incident edges.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- Potential 3-stars with central node 9:
  - (9, 8, 1), (9, 14, 3), (9, 10, 5)

- Potential 3-stars with central node 8:
  - (8, 9, 2), (8, 4, 13), (8, 2, 7), (8, 1, 6), (8, 14, 3)

- Potential 3-stars with central node 13:
  - (13, 4, 5), (13, 12, 4), (13, 11, 4), (13, 14, 9), (13, 7, 2)

3. Count the total number of 3-stars: [8]

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<9, (8, 1, 6)>, <9, (14, 3, 9)>, <9, (10, 5, 2)>, <8, (9, 2, 7)>, <8, (4, 13, 11)>, <13, (4, 5, 12)>, <13, (11, 4, 13)>, <13, (7, 2, 13)>
[8]
