Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 10) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the nodes with exactly three incident edges, as these nodes can potentially be the central nodes of 3-stars. Let's list those nodes and their neighbors:
- Node 0: (8, 10, 13, 1)
- Node 1: (11, 0, 5, 14, 9)
- Node 2: (9, 3, 11)
- Node 3: (4, 8, 11, 5, 2)
- Node 6: (4, 12, 11, 10)
- Node 7: (4, 12, 13)
- Node 8: (4, 14, 0, 3)
- Node 9: (2, 0, 1, 13)
- Node 10: (12, 0, 6, 13)
- Node 12: (7, 13, 10, 6)
- Node 13: (7, 12, 0, 10, 9)
- Node 14: (8, 1)

Next, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <0, (8, 10, 13)>
2. <1, (11, 0, 5)>
3. <3, (4, 8, 11)>
4. <6, (4, 12, 11)>
5. <7, (4, 12, 13)>
6. <9, (2, 0, 1)>
7. <10, (12, 0, 6)>
8. <13, (7, 12, 0)>
9. <14, (8, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
