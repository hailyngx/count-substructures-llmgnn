Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (12, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 10) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 5) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the possible 3-stars. 

Looking at the definition of a 3-star, we see that a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. 

Next, we can list all unique 3-stars by examining each node and checking if it meets the criteria of being the central node of a 3-star. 

Here are the unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (9, 13, 14)>
<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<2, (6, 9, 14)>
<3, (1, 6, 11)>
<4, (5, 6, 14)>
<5, (1, 4, 11)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (11, 13, 12)>
<10, (1, 5, 13)>
<12, (13, 8, 11)>
<14, (0, 2, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
