Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<4, (7, 1, 2)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (7, 1, 3)>
<9, (7, 8, 6)>
<2, (4, 8, 1)>
<8, (6, 9, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<3, (6, 2, 0)>
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<0, (2, 8, 3)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]
