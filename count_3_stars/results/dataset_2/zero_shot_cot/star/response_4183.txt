Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which can serve as potential centers of 3-stars. Based on the given information, nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 have degree 5, while nodes 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have degree 4.

Next, let's identify the 3-stars. A 3-star consists of a center node and three leaf nodes. Since we want to count the number of 3-stars and list them uniquely, we need to identify each valid 3-star.

Observations:
1. Nodes 5 and 4 are connected by the edge (5, 4), suggesting a potential 3-star <5, (4, x, y)>, where x and y are the other two nodes connected to node 5.
2. Similarly, nodes 4 and 1 are connected by the edge (4, 1), suggesting a potential 3-star <4, (1, x, y)>.

Identified 3-stars:
<5, (4, 0, 1)>
<4, (1, 0, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
