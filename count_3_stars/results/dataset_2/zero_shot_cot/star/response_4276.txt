Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph: 
<5, (9, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (8, 2, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 7, )>  (This one is incomplete as it has only 2 connections)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
