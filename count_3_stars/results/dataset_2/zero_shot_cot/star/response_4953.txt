Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 15) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 11) (26, 16) (12, 27) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 7) (15, 9) (15, 22) (20, 13) (20, 24) (20, 11) (7, 27) (21, 9) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (6, 28) (6, 17) (6, 18) (2, 19) (2, 10) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 10) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 16) (13, 0) (19, 12) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 29) (17, 6) (17, 0) (25, 28) (25, 22) (24, 20) (24, 8) (24, 14) (11, 26) (11, 20) (11, 14) (14, 24) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 1) (14, 23) (1, 14) (1, 29) (1, 16) (1, 18) (29, 19) (29, 1) (29, 5) (0, 13) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 0) (5, 28) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 14) (23, 5) (22, 15) (22, 25) (22, 14) (16, 26) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (10, 28) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 4) (18, 21) (18, 6) (18, 1) (18, 16) (4, 16) (4, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, first, we need to find all the 3-stars present. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<9, (15, 21, 26)>
<26, (11, 13, 16)>
<12, (19, 27, 29)>
<15, (9, 21, 22)>
<20, (11, 13, 24)>
<7, (27, 28, 10)>
<21, (18, 28, 9)>
<28, (5, 6, 10)>
<6, (17, 18, 28)>
<2, (8, 10, 19)>
<8, (10, 19, 24)>
<13, (0, 11, 26)>
<19, (2, 8, 29)>
<17, (0, 6, 28)>
<25, (14, 22, 28)>
<24, (8, 14, 20)>
<11, (14, 20, 26)>
<14, (1, 11, 24)>
<1, (16, 18, 29)>
<29, (1, 19, 5)>
<0, (13, 17, 3)>
<5, (23, 28, 29)>
<23, (5, 14, 28)>
<22, (14, 15, 25)>
<16, (1, 13, 26)>
<10, (2, 8, 28)>
<18, (1, 16, 21)>
<4, (10, 16, 28)>

Now, to get the total count of 3-stars, we put the above list in the brackets:
[29]
