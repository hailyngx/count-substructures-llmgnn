Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 28) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 23) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 28) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 4) (25, 21) (2, 18) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 19) (28, 5) (28, 20) (28, 29) (28, 12) (28, 27) (29, 9) (29, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 20) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 0) (22, 7) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 4) (15, 21) (10, 2) (10, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 7) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 7) (0, 26) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 2) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 6) (24, 23) (11, 23) (23, 9) (23, 13) (23, 24) (23, 11) (8, 29) (8, 3) (8, 27) (21, 25) (21, 15) (21, 14) (27, 28) (27, 19) (27, 8) (16, 1) (16, 10) (12, 28) (3, 26) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 22) (7, 13) (7, 17) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 21) (4, 25) (4, 2) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 6) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

The possible 3-stars can be formed by choosing a center node and its three connected nodes. Let's go through the edges and identify all 3-stars:

1. Center node 2:
    - <2, (6, 10, 14)>
    - <2, (4, 6, 14)>
    
2. Center node 4:
    - <4, (2, 6, 15)>
    - <4, (15, 17, 25)>
    
3. Center node 6:
    - <6, (2, 4, 25)>
    - <6, (20, 24, 25)>

4. Center node 9:
    - <9, (5, 14, 29)>
    
5. Center node 13:
    - <13, (3, 7, 23)>
    
6. Center node 15:
    - <15, (1, 4, 21)>
    
7. Center node 17:
    - <17, (4, 7, 13)>
    
8. Center node 19:
    - <19, (18, 26, 27)>
    
9. Center node 20:
    - <20, (6, 26, 28)>
    
10. Center node 21:
    - <21, (14, 15, 25)>
    
11. Center node 23:
    - <23, (7, 13, 24)>
    
12. Center node 25:
    - <25, (4, 6, 21)>
    
13. Center node 26:
    - <26, (3, 19, 0)>
    
14. Center node 28:
    - <28, (5, 20, 29)>
    
15. Center node 29:
    - <29, (8, 9, 25)>
    
Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us [15].
