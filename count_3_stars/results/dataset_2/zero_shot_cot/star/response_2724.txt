Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 12) (3, 13) (3, 18) (3, 4) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (2, 5) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 10) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 9) (12, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 4) (1, 9) (18, 3) (18, 17) (18, 0) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential central nodes of 3-stars.

The nodes that have exactly three edges are:
- Node 0 (connected to nodes 6, 7, 18)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 4, 13, 18)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 2, 12, 17)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 2, 8, 19)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 5, 9, 19)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 1, 8, 12)
- Node 12 (connected to nodes 4, 9, 10)
- Node 15 (connected to nodes 13, 14, 19)
- Node 16 (connected to nodes 11, 12, 17)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (6, 7, 18)>
<3, (4, 13, 18)>
<4, (2, 12, 17)>
<5, (2, 8, 19)>
<8, (5, 9, 19)>
<9, (1, 8, 12)>
<12, (4, 9, 10)>
<15, (13, 14, 19)>
<16, (11, 12, 17)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, represented by the combinations above.
The total count of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
