Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 29) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 22) (9, 16) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 21) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 2) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 10) (25, 11) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 15) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (12, 24) (0, 2) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 14) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 27) (5, 13) (5, 16) (16, 9) (16, 21) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 18) (29, 6) (29, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (15, 8) (18, 28) (27, 13) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 14) (10, 25) (10, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 16) (17, 3) (22, 9) (22, 27) (24, 12) (24, 27) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 27) (11, 6) (11, 25) (11, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find them step-by-step.

1. Identify nodes with exactly 3 edges (leaves):
- Node 6 has 4 edges (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 29), (6, 11).
- Node 9 has 5 edges (9, 6), (9, 19), (9, 22), (9, 16), (9, 7).
- Node 7 has 3 edges (7, 9), (7, 21), (7, 1).
- Node 21 has 3 edges (21, 7), (21, 16), (21, 2).
- Node 25 has 4 edges (25, 20), (25, 17), (25, 10), (25, 11).
- Node 23 has 4 edges (23, 8), (23, 26), (23, 17), (23, 13).
- Node 4 has 3 edges (4, 8), (4, 29), (4, 2).
- Node 13 has 4 edges (13, 23), (13, 26), (13, 5), (13, 27).
- Node 5 has 2 edges (5, 13), (5, 16).
- Node 28 has 5 edges (28, 19), (28, 26), (28, 16), (28, 3), (28, 18).
- Node 29 has 2 edges (29, 6).
- Node 1 has 3 edges (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 10).
- Node 15 has 1 edge (15, 8).
- Node 18 has 1 edge (18, 28).
- Node 27 has 4 edges (27, 13), (27, 22), (27, 24), (27, 14).
- Node 12 has 1 edge (12, 24).
- Node 0 has 1 edge (0, 2).
- Node 2 has 5 edges (2, 21), (2, 4), (2, 0), (2, 14), (2, 11).
- Node 19 has 4 edges (19, 9), (19, 20), (19, 28), (19, 14).
- Node 26 has 3 edges (26, 23), (26, 13), (26, 28).
- Node 16 has 5 edges (16, 9), (16, 21), (16, 5), (16, 28), (16, 17).
- Node 10 has 2 edges (10, 25).
- Node 3 has 2 edges (3, 28).
- Node 17 has 4 edges (17, 25), (17, 23), (17, 16), (17, 3).
- Node 22 has 2 edges (22, 9).

2. Find 3-stars:
- Nodes with exactly 3 edges can be central nodes in potential 3-stars. Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 1, 29)>
<9, (6, 19, 22)>
<7, (9, 21, 1)>
<21, (7, 16, 2)>
<25, (20, 17, 10)>
<23, (8, 26, 17)>
<4, (8, 29, 2)>
<13, (23, 26, 5)>
<28, (19, 26, 3)>
<1, (6, 7, 10)>
<27, (13, 22, 24)>

Therefore, there are [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
