Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

<9, (6, 8, 7)>
<6, (9, 3, 2)>
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (9, 2, 7)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars, we have found a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
