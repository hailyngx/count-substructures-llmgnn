Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (14, 6) (14, 17) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 1) (4, 6) (4, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (1, 16) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 19) (19, 16) (19, 6) (19, 18) (19, 1) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (15, 16) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 19.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 0.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 17, and 15.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 19.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 16, 17, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 13.

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
The 3-stars in this graph are:
<6, (9, 14, 19)>
<9, (6, 7, 0)>
<14, (6, 17, 15)>
<16, (1, 7, 19)>
<1, (16, 17, 2)>
<2, (1, 14, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
