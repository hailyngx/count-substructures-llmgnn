Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of times a node has exactly 3 incident edges. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<4, (7, 8, 10)>
<7, (4, 3, 9)>
<3, (7, 0, 14)>
<6, (1, 3, 12)>
<9, (7, 2, 14)>
<8, (4, 6, 5)>
<0, (3, 2, 11)>
<2, (4, 9, 5)>
<12, (3, 6, 13)>
<11, (1, 0, 14)>
<14, (3, 9, 5)>

Thus, there are a total of [11] 3-stars in the given graph.
