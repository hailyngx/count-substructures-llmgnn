Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them:  

- Node 4 has 4 edges: (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 5)  
- Node 7 has 4 edges: (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (7, 5)  
- Node 9 has 4 edges: (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 3)  
- Node 5 has 4 edges: (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 1), (5, 8)  

Now, we can construct the 3-stars using these nodes.  

The 3-star configurations are:  
<4, (7, 8, 9)>  
<7, (4, 6, 5)>  
<9, (4, 7, 1)>  
<5, (4, 7, 8)>  

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [4]  
Therefore, the final answer is [4].
