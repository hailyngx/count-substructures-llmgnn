Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 6) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 0) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 13) (17, 3) (17, 14) (17, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (5, 17) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 5) (0, 15) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 13) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 8) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 18) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern. 

Let's start by examining each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. We'll consider each node's neighbors and check if they are connected to each other, forming a 3-star with the node as the center. 

Here are the unique 3-star patterns found in the graph:

<0, (1, 15, 19)>
<1, (0, 14, 18)>
<2, (10, 12, 13)>
<3, (10, 15, 17)>
<4, (5, 7, 12)>
<5, (6, 12, 17)>
<6, (3, 5, 15)>
<7, (0, 4, 12)>
<8, (10, 14, 18)>
<9, (0, 11, 19)>
<13, (2, 14, 19)>
<14, (1, 8, 13)>
<15, (3, 5, 16)>
<16, (15, 18, 3)>
<17, (3, 5, 14)>
<18, (1, 14, 16)>
<19, (1, 13, 0)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph:
