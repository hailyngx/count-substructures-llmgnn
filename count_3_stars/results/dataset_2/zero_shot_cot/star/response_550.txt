Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 18) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 18) (8, 7) (6, 19) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 18) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 11) (9, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 18) (10, 12) (10, 3) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 11) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 9) (19, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars based on the edges provided.

Let's list all the 3-stars:

<0, (1, 8, 15)>
<1, (0, 12, 17)>
<2, (5, 16, 17)>
<3, (10, 12, 18)>
<4, (11, 13, 18)>
<5, (2, 8, 16)>
<6, (19, 7, 18)>
<7, (9, 13, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 12)>
<9, (7, 11, 16)>
<10, (3, 12, 18)>
<11, (4, 18, 9)>
<12, (1, 10, 16)>
<13, (4, 7, 18)>
<14, (18, 15, 4)>
<15, (0, 18, 5)>
<16, (2, 12, 9)>
<17, (1, 2, 17)>
<18, (3, 4, 15)>
<19, (6, 18, 7)>

Now count the total number of unique 3-stars using the list above:
[20]
