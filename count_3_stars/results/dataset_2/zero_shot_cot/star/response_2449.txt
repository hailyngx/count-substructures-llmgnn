Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 15) (13, 0) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 19) (15, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 19) (7, 18) (0, 13) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 2) (9, 16) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their neighbor nodes based on the given edges:
- Central node 1 has neighbors 17, 18.
- Central node 2 has neighbors 16, 17, 12, 4.
- Central node 3 has neighbors 17, 0, 5.
- Central node 4 has neighbors 11, 13, 2.
- Central node 5 has neighbors 3, 10.
- Central node 6 has neighbors 8, 14, 10.
- Central node 7 has neighbors 19, 18.
- Central node 8 has neighbors 14, 10, 6, 12.
- Central node 9 has neighbors 16, 14.
- Central node 10 has neighbors 8, 6, 5.
- Central node 11 has neighbors 16, 4.
- Central node 12 has neighbors 8, 13, 2.
- Central node 13 has neighbors 12, 4, 15, 0.
- Central node 14 has neighbors 8, 6, 9.
- Central node 15 has neighbors 13, 17, 19, 18.
- Central node 16 has neighbors 11, 17, 2, 9.
- Central node 17 has neighbors 16, 1, 3, 2, 15.
- Central node 18 has neighbors 1, 15, 7.
- Central node 19 has neighbors 15, 7.

There are a total of 11 different 3-star configurations:
<1, (17, 18)>
<2, (16, 17, 4)>
<3, (17, 0, 5)>
<4, (11, 13, 2)>
<5, (3, 10, 5)>
<6, (8, 14, 6)>
<7, (19, 18, 15)>
<9, (16, 14, 9)>
<11, (16, 17, 2)>
<16, (12, 13, 4)>
<17, (15, 17, 19)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
