Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify unique occurrences of the 3-star configuration.

The 3-star configurations in the graph are as follows:
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (8, 4, 1)>
<6, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (9, 8, 2)>
<8, (9, 6, 4)>
<2, (4, 1, 3)>
<0, (6, 8, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
