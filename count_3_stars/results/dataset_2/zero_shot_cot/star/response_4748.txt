Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to find the number of 3-stars in it.

First, let's find the nodes with exactly 3 connections (degree 3) since the center of a 3-star must have degree 3. The nodes with degree 3 in this graph are:
- Node 5 (connected to 1, 3, 4)
- Node 9 (connected to 3, 5, 7)
- Node 1 (connected to 2, 4, 5)
- Node 7 (connected to 1, 6, 9)
- Node 0 (connected to 4, 6, 8)
- Node 6 (connected to 0, 2, 7)

Next, we identify and count the 3-stars in the graph:
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 4, 5)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <0, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
