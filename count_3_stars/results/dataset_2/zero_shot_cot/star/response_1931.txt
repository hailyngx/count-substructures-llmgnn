Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 16) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 19) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 16) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 13) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 14) (17, 5) (17, 9) (15, 10) (15, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 2) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 12) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 19) (2, 6) (14, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

1. First, identify the nodes that have exactly 3 edges each. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. From the given edges, the nodes with exactly 3 edges are nodes: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

2. For each of these central nodes, count the number of 3-stars that can be formed with them. To form a 3-star, we need to find nodes that are connected to the central node and also connected to each other (forming a triangle with the central node).

3. Counting the number of 3-stars for each central node:

- Central Node 1: <1, (2, 3, 10)>
- Central Node 3: <3, (1, 7, 16)>
- Central Node 5: <5, (0, 13, 17)>
- Central Node 7: <7, (6, 12, 19)>
- Central Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed.
- Central Node 11: <11, (13, 15, 19)>
- Central Node 12: <12, (16, 7, 18)>
- Central Node 13: <13, (8, 11, 5)>
- Central Node 15: <15, (10, 13, 17)>
- Central Node 16: <16, (1, 3, 12)>
- Central Node 17: <17, (5, 9, 15)>
- Central Node 18: <18, (6, 19, 12)>
- Central Node 19: <19, (2, 7, 11)>

4. Calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
