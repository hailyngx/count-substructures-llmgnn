Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 13) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 14) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (1, 6) (1, 8) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 13) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph step-by-step. 

1. Identify all nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 6, 10, 11, 12, 5
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 6, 8
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 8, 14
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 6, 11, 4, 12
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 8, 13, 3, 5
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 10, 4, 0, 14
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 13, 0
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 9, 11, 12, 13
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 2, 1
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 8, 4, 14, 7
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 11, 0, 12, 5
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 10, 3, 14, 7, 0
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 10, 7, 0, 3
- Node 13: Connected to nodes 6, 4, 7, 14
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 9, 11, 2, 5, 13

2. Find all 3-stars:
- <0, (6, 10, 12)>
- <1, (6, 4, 8)>
- <2, (8, 9, 14)>
- <3, (6, 4, 12)>
- <4, (9, 8, 13)>
- <5, (10, 4, 14)>
- <6, (1, 3, 13)>
- <7, (9, 11, 13)>
- <8, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (8, 4, 14)>
- <10, (0, 5, 12)>
- <11, (0, 3, 14)>
- <12, (0, 7, 10)>
- <13, (6, 7, 14)>
- <14, (2, 9, 11)>

Therefore, there are total [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
