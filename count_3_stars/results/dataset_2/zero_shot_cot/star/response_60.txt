Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 10) (25, 3) (25, 7) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 28) (20, 14) (20, 28) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 15) (13, 12) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 7) (2, 22) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 21) (17, 1) (17, 27) (17, 15) (0, 22) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 29) (7, 25) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 28) (5, 15) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 29) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 27) (6, 14) (6, 16) (21, 2) (21, 4) (4, 1) (4, 21) (4, 24) (12, 13) (12, 14) (18, 19) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 19) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 5) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 6) (14, 12) (16, 2) (16, 6) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 28) (9, 10) (24, 4) (24, 28) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 3 to find the 3-stars involving node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 11, and 10.

Next, we will find the 3-stars involving other nodes by repeating the same process for each node:
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 3, 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 26, 27.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 9.
- Node 25 only forms one 3-star: <25, (3, 7, 29)>.
- Node 11 only forms one 3-star: <11, (3, 26, 27)>.
- Node 10 only forms one 3-star: <10, (3, 5, 9)>.

Combining all 3-stars found, we have:
- <25, (3, 7, 29)>
- <11, (3, 26, 27)>
- <10, (3, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
