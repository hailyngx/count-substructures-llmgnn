Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 13) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 9) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 19) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 17) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes for each 3-star. 

Let's start by finding all the 3-stars:

1. Identify the nodes that are connected to a central node with exactly 3 edges.
2. Make a note of each unique 3-star found.

After analyzing the provided edges, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 11, 13)>
<1, (6, 9, 17)>
<2, (4, 5, 17)>
<3, (8, 9, 17)>
<4, (2, 6, 11)>
<5, (2, 6, 15)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (10, 15, 19)>
<8, (3, 8, 12)>
<9, (1, 3, 17)>
<10, (7, 8, 14)>
<11, (0, 4, 17)>
<12, (4, 8, 15)>
<13, (0, 16, 19)>
<14, (8, 10, 12)>
<15, (5, 12, 18)>
<16, (13, 15, 18)>
<17, (2, 3, 9)>
<18, (8, 15, 19)>
<19, (7, 18, 15)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [20].
