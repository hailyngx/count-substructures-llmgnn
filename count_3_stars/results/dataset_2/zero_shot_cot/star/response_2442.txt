Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 22) (0, 18) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 17) (27, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) (29, 7) (29, 11) (29, 18) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 2) (3, 28) (10, 17) (10, 24) (10, 16) (17, 27) (17, 10) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 22) (5, 28) (6, 5) (6, 15) (15, 6) (15, 20) (15, 23) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 19) (22, 0) (22, 5) (22, 26) (26, 22) (26, 11) (16, 10) (16, 28) (28, 3) (28, 5) (28, 16) (28, 24) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 14) (7, 29) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 23) (19, 20) (19, 21) (12, 15) (11, 29) (11, 1) (11, 26) (11, 7) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 18) (24, 10) (24, 28) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 21) (23, 13) (21, 27) (21, 19) (21, 23) (18, 0) (18, 29) (18, 14) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 20) (13, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly 3 other nodes forming a star pattern.

After analyzing the provided edges, we can list the unique 3-stars as follows:
<0, (27, 22, 18)>
<27, (0, 21, 17)>
<2, (3, 14, -)>
<29, (7, 11, 18)>
<1, (11, 13, 9)>
<3, (2, 28, -)>
<10, (17, 24, 16)>
<4, (17, 8, 13)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (8, 6, 22)>
<6, (5, 15, -)>
<15, (6, 20, 23)>
<20, (15, 13, 19)>
<22, (0, 5, 26)>
<26, (22, 11, -)>
<16, (10, 28, -)>
<28, (3, 5, 16)>
<9, (27, 1, 8)>
<7, (29, 8, 11)>
<19, (20, 21, -)>
<12, (15, -/-, -/-)>
<14, (2, 9, 18)>
<24, (10, 28, -)>
<23, (15, 7, 21)>
<21, (27, 19, 23)>
<18, (0, 29, 14)>
<13, (1, 4, 20)>

Since all the unique 3-stars have been listed, we can now count them to find the total number. 
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [27].
