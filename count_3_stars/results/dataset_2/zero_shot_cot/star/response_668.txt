Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 19) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 19) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 18) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 15) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 7) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 18) (17, 7) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (3, 19) (3, 4) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 1) (4, 3) (4, 14) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 12) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 1) (0, 17) (0, 19) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 4) (7, 10) (7, 17) (7, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (11, 6, 15)>
<2, (16, 17, 1)>
<3, (19, 0, 4)>
<4, (3, 14, 6)>
<5, (8, 14, 5)>
<6, (13, 15, 7)>
<7, (10, 18, 17)>
<8, (5, 13, 8)>
<9, (18, 17, 12)>
<10, (15, 10, 7)>
<11, (1, 19, 6)>
<12, (10, 18, 12)>
<13, (8, 15, 6)>
<14, (5, 8, 6)>
<15, (16, 15, 1)>
<16, (2, 17, 19)>
<17, (0, 7, 18)>
<18, (9, 12, 17)>
<19, (11, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
