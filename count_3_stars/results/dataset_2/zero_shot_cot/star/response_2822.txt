Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 20) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 10) (20, 7) (20, 23) (20, 5) (20, 28) (25, 28) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 26) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 27) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 12) (17, 4) (17, 29) (29, 17) (29, 3) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 12) (24, 28) (6, 21) (6, 24) (6, 2) (6, 23) (0, 1) (0, 22) (0, 2) (10, 21) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 2) (9, 1) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 27) (22, 4) (22, 0) (22, 5) (22, 28) (18, 11) (18, 13) (3, 7) (3, 29) (3, 27) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 8) (14, 23) (12, 26) (12, 24) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 15) (2, 13) (5, 20) (5, 15) (5, 22) (28, 20) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 22) (27, 1) (27, 19) (27, 3) (27, 23) (23, 20) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 27) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph:

<4, (8, 17, 22)>
<8, (4, 11, 14)>
<11, (8, 12, 18)>
<12, (26, 11, 13)>
<13, (18, 2, 12)>
<15, (10, 2, 5)>
<17, (4, 29, 0)>
<18, (11, 13, 6)>
<20, (7, 23, 5)>
<21, (7, 21, 6)>
<22, (4, 0, 5)>
<24, (26, 6, 28)>
<26, (1, 24, 12)>
<27, (1, 19, 3)>
<28, (20, 25, 22)>
<29, (17, 3, 0)>

So, there are a total of [16] 3-stars in the given graph.
