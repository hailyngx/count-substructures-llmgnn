Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 13) (7, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 5) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 2) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 1, and 14: <6, (9, 1, 14)>
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 10: <9, (6, 4, 10)>
Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 14, and 1: <4, (9, 14, 1)>
Node 11 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 3, and 13: <11, (10, 3, 13)>
Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 12, and 1: <0, (6, 12, 1)>
Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 0: <14, (6, 4, 0)>
Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 11, 0, and 14: <5, (11, 0, 14)>
Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 6, 10, and 0: <12, (6, 10, 0)>
Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 11: <13, (9, 7, 11)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: [9]
