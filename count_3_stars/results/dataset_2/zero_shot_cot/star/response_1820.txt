Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 21) (9, 12) (26, 19) (26, 15) (26, 3) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 15) (6, 19) (3, 26) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 0) (20, 25) (20, 11) (12, 9) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 1) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 2) (0, 3) (0, 25) (0, 4) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 29) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 21) (8, 7) (17, 29) (17, 7) (29, 4) (29, 17) (29, 23) (18, 27) (18, 4) (18, 24) (18, 13) (19, 26) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 23) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 15) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 23) (16, 1) (24, 6) (24, 18) (24, 5) (11, 20) (11, 7) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (15, 26) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 23) (15, 2) (14, 7) (14, 21) (22, 10) (22, 21) (23, 29) (23, 19) (23, 1) (23, 15) (2, 27) (2, 11) (2, 15) (21, 9) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 22) (13, 18) (10, 22) 

Response:
First, let's find all the possible 3-stars in the given graph.

Using the given edges, we can identify the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 25, 4)>
<1, (12, 23, 16)>
<2, (15, 27, 11)>
<5, (15, 24, 12)>
<6, (9, 15, 19)>
<7, (8, 11, 17)>
<9, (6, 12, 21)>
<10, (21, 22, 22)>
<11, (2, 7, 21)>
<12, (1, 5, 27)>
<15, (2, 5, 15)>
<16, (1, 23, 1)>
<17, (7, 14, 29)>
<18, (4, 13, 27)>
<19, (6, 8, 23)>
<21, (9, 14, 22)>
<22, (10, 21, 22)>
<23, (1, 15, 29)>
<24, (5, 18, 6)>
<25, (0, 3, 20)>
<26, (3, 6, 19)>
<27, (1, 12, 18)>
<29, (4, 17, 23)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph. 
So total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
