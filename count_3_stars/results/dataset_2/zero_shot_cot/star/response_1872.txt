Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 16) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 11) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 3) (16, 2) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 10) (19, 15) (15, 19) (15, 12) (15, 11) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 10) (5, 14) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (12, 15) (13, 1) (13, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 3) (11, 18) (11, 15) (11, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to look for nodes that are connected in a star pattern. Since each 3-star has a center node with 3 other nodes connected to it, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that have 3 neighbors connected to them. These nodes will serve as the center nodes of potential 3-stars.

2. For each identified center node, check if it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

3. If a center node is connected to 3 other nodes, then it forms a 3-star.

Let's go through the graph step by step:

1. Nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 18, 9, 5, 10.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 18, 4.
These nodes do not have exactly 3 neighbors, so they are not center nodes of 3-stars.

2. Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (8, 1, 16)>
<1, (0, 9, 13)>
<3, (4, 0, 16)>
<4, (17, 8, 6)>
<6, (4, 11, 13)>
<8, (4, 7, 10)>
<9, (14, 7, 2)>
<11, (18, 15, 6)>
<15, (19, 12, 11)>
<16, (0, 2, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
