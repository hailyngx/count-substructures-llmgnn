Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 2, 3), (0, 4, 8)
- Node 1: (1, 4, 6), (1, 5, 8)
- Node 2: (2, 0, 9), (2, 1, 9)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 6), (3, 4, 9)
- Node 4: (4, 0, 3), (4, 1, 7)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 3), (6, 7, 8)
- Node 7: (7, 4, 6), (7, 5, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 0, 1), (8, 6, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 2, 3), (9, 7, 8)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, -)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>
