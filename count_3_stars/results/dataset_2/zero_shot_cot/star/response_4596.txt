Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 4) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 18) (23, 29) (23, 6) (12, 27) (12, 24) (27, 9) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 3) (27, 16) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 19) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 13) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 24) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 17) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 13) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (25, 29) (25, 11) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 20) (19, 7) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 23) (18, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (16, 27) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 14) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (2, 17) (2, 7) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the centers of potential 3-stars.

Based on the given edges, the nodes that have degree 3 are:
- Node 9 (connected to 26, 28, 27)
- Node 22 (connected to 23, 19, 0)
- Node 23 (connected to 22, 5, 18)
- Node 27 (connected to 9, 12, 14)
- Node 2 (connected to 17, 7, 4)
- Node 15 (connected to 10, 4, 11)
- Node 14 (connected to 27, 1, 7)
- Node 8 (connected to 1, 24, 14)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
<9, (26, 28, 27)>
<22, (23, 19, 0)>
<23, (22, 5, 18)>
<27, (9, 12, 14)>
<2, (17, 7, 4)>
<15, (10, 4, 11)>
<14, (27, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 24, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
