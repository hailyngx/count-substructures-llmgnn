Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 3) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 15) (1, 11) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 16) (19, 17) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 7) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 7) (18, 14) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 9) (7, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (13, 15) (13, 12) (13, 18) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 14 since these connections represent a possible 3-star centered at node 14. Nodes 0, 8, and 18 are connected to node 14.

Thus, we have one 3-star centered at node 14: <14, (0, 8, 18)>.

Now, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 17. Nodes 0, 19, and 4 are connected to node 17.

Thus, we have one 3-star centered at node 17: <17, (0, 19, 4)>.

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 0. Nodes 14, 17, and 3 are connected to node 0.

Thus, we have one 3-star centered at node 0: <0, (14, 17, 3)>.

Moving on, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 8. Nodes 14, 3, and 19 are connected to node 8.

Thus, we have one 3-star centered at node 8: <8, (14, 3, 19)>.

Now, counting the number of unique 3-stars found in the graph, we have a total of [4].
