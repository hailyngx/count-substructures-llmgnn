Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 9) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 21) (21, 7) (21, 26) (21, 29) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 27) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 14) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 23) (14, 25) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 27) (26, 21) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 2) (9, 11) (9, 22) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 20) (22, 29) (6, 10) (6, 20) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 26) (2, 10) (12, 16) (12, 8) (23, 4) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 1) (1, 23) (1, 10) (29, 21) (29, 19) (29, 22) (17, 4) (17, 8) (13, 25) (13, 6) (13, 20) (13, 18) (24, 22) (24, 27) (24, 5) (27, 3) (27, 19) (27, 24) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 1) (18, 25) (18, 0) (18, 13) (8, 12) (8, 17) (20, 22) (20, 6) (20, 13) (20, 28) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 28) (5, 24) (5, 15) (5, 28) (28, 20) (28, 15) (28, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step by step:

1. Identify all nodes with degree 3:
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 3, and 9.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 15.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 23, and 17.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 21, and 26.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 0, and 27.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 13, 18, and 14.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 7, 26, and 29.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 18, and 23.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 25, 19, and 27.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 26, 2, and 29.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 21, 19, and 23.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 22, and 22 (counted twice).
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 9, 24, and 20.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 20, and 13.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 19, and 26.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 16, 8, and 8 (counted twice).
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 26.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 23, 10, and 10 (counted twice).
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 21, 19, and 22.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 8 (counted twice).
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 25, 6, and 20.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 22, 27, and 5.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 3, 19, and 24.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 1.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 25, 0, and 13.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
- We have the following unique 3-stars: 
<11, (16, 3, 9)>, 
<16, (11, 12, 15)>,
<4, (7, 23, 17)>,
<7, (4, 21, 26)>, 
<3, (11, 0, 27)>,
<25, (13, 18, 14)>,
<21, (7, 26, 29)>, 
<0, (3, 18, 23)>,
<14, (25, 19, 27)>,
<19, (26, 2, 29)>,
<26, (21, 19, 23)>,
<22, (9, 24, 20)>,
<6, (10, 20, 13)>,
<2, (4, 19, 26)>,
<23, (4, 0, 26)>,
<1, (23, 10, 10)>,
<17, (4, 8, 8)>,
<13, (25, 6, 20)>,
<24, (22, 27, 5)>,
<27, (3, 19, 24)>,
<10, (6, 2, 1)>,
<18, (25, 0, 13)>.

3. Final Answer:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].
