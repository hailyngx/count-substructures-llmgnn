Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can identify all unique 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Given the edges provided, let's find all the unique 3-stars within the graph:

<5, (9, 12, 11)>
<9, (5, 4, 10)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (4, 12, 13)>
<1, (4, 7, 0)>
<3, (9, 10, 8)>
<6, (14, 2, 12)>
<10, (9, 3, 11)>
<11, (5, 10, 0)>
<8, (4, 3, 6)>
<12, (5, 7, 6)>
<0, (1, 11, 14)>
<14, (6, 8, 0)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<13, (5, 7, 0)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
