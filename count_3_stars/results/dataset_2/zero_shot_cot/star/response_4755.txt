Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 12) (15, 6) (16, 13) (16, 17) (12, 4) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 18) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 17) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 8) (7, 19) (17, 16) (17, 2) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 12) (18, 6) (18, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

- Node 0 is connected to: 5, 10, 11, 4
- Node 1 is connected to: 5, 11, 8, 6
- Node 2 is connected to: 3, 13, 12, 14, 17
- Node 3 is connected to: 5, 2
- Node 4 is connected to: 9, 8, 12, 6, 0
- Node 5 is connected to: 9, 1, 0, 3
- Node 6 is connected to: 4, 15, 1, 18
- Node 7 is connected to: 8, 19
- Node 8 is connected to: 10, 13, 4, 1, 7
- Node 9 is connected to: 5, 4
- Node 10 is connected to: 0, 8
- Node 11 is connected to: 1, 0
- Node 12 is connected to: 4, 19, 2, 18
- Node 13 is connected to: 8, 16, 2
- Node 14 is connected to: 2, 18
- Node 15 is connected to: 6
- Node 16 is connected to: 13, 17
- Node 17 is connected to: 16, 2
- Node 18 is connected to: 12, 6, 14
- Node 19 is connected to: 7, 12

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. 

[<3, (2, 13, 17)>, <7, (8, 19, 7)>, <10, (0, 10, 8)>, <11, (0, 11, 1)>, <14, (2, 14, 18)>, <16, (13, 16, 17)>]
