Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5, considering the given edges: 3, 6, 7, 9, and 14. 
Now, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 9: 2, 5, 8, 12, and 13. 
Next, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 1: 3, 8, 10, 11, and 12. 
Then, let's find the nodes that are connected to node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5. 

Now, let's count the 3-stars: 
1. <5, (3, 6, 7)>
2. <9, (2, 8, 12)>

The number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
