Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 10) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 18) (27, 23) (27, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 16) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 17) (4, 2) (6, 22) (6, 27) (28, 11) (28, 3) (28, 1) (19, 13) (19, 26) (19, 14) (19, 20) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 10) (26, 7) (11, 28) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 7) (9, 10) (29, 24) (2, 4) (2, 15) (17, 4) (17, 25) (17, 5) (25, 17) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 10) (23, 27) (23, 26) (16, 8) (16, 21) (16, 14) (21, 25) (21, 16) (21, 12) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 20) (10, 22) (10, 8) (10, 26) (10, 9) (10, 25) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 24) (20, 19) (20, 18) (20, 24) (12, 13) (12, 21) (24, 0) (24, 29) (24, 1) (24, 20) (24, 14) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 15) (15, 2) (15, 25) (15, 18) (15, 5) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 7) (14, 24) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

By analyzing the provided edges, we find the following unique 3-stars:

<0, (3, 18, 24)>
<1, (7, 24, 28)>
<2, (4, 15, 2)>
<3, (0, 7, 28)>
<4, (2, 17, 5)>
<5, (2, 15, 5)>
<6, (22, 27, 10)>
<7, (1, 3, 14)>
<8, (10, 16, 4)>
<9, (10, 22, 26)>
<11, (28, 3, 1)>
<12, (13, 21, 22)>
<13, (19, 12, 22)>
<14, (7, 24, 19)>
<15, (2, 25, 5)>
<16, (8, 21, 14)>
<17, (4, 5, 25)>
<18, (0, 20, 15)>
<19, (13, 20, 26)>
<20, (19, 24, 18)>
<21, (16, 12, 25)>
<22, (6, 13, 10)>
<23, (27, 26, 23)>
<24, (0, 20, 1)>
<25, (17, 15, 21)>
<26, (19, 27, 10)>
<27, (23, 26, 6)>
<28, (1, 11, 3)>
<29, (24, 0, 1)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, we can see that there are 29 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
