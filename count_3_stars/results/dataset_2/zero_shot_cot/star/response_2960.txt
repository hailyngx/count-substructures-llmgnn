Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. Central nodes have degree 3.

The degrees of the nodes are:
Node 0: 5
Node 1: 4
Node 2: 5
Node 3: 3
Node 4: 2
Node 5: 5
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 4
Node 8: 5
Node 9: 5

The central nodes are 2, 5, 8, and 9.

Next, let's find the leaves of each 3-star by identifying the nodes directly connected to the central nodes.

For central node 2: (2, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 0)
For central node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 7)
For central node 8: (8, 5), (8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 0)
For central node 9: (9, 5), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 7), (9, 0)

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (5, 8, 3)>
<2, (5, 7, 1)>
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 7, 1)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<8, (5, 3, 6)>
<8, (5, 2, 1)>
<8, (5, 0, 3)>
<9, (5, 3, 1)>
<9, (5, 7, 0)>

There are 12 unique 3-stars in the graph, so the final answer is [12].
