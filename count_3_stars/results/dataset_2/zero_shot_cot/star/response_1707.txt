Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (22, 18) (22, 11) (9, 29) (9, 25) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 10) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 27) (21, 7) (21, 11) (21, 15) (2, 18) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 16) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 29) (8, 1) (17, 13) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 27) (29, 9) (29, 8) (29, 17) (24, 3) (24, 10) (24, 23) (26, 11) (26, 3) (15, 21) (15, 16) (16, 4) (16, 17) (16, 15) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 25) (12, 0) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 26) (3, 28) (28, 8) (28, 3) (28, 20) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 27) (23, 24) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 19) (25, 9) (25, 12) (25, 14) (25, 10) (14, 23) (14, 25) (0, 12) (0, 19) (11, 22) (11, 21) (11, 26) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 25) (10, 19) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 23) (19, 0) (19, 10) (20, 28) (20, 27) (27, 7) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
The nodes that fit this criteria are: 4, 8, 10, 12, 16, 19, 23, 25, 27, and 29. 

Next, let's find the 3-star graphs involving these nodes:
<4, (1, 8, 12)>
<8, (4, 1, 29)>
<10, (18, 24, 25)>
<12, (13, 4, 0)>
<16, (4, 17, 15)>
<19, (13, 7, 23)>
<23, (24, 5, 14)>
<25, (9, 12, 10)>
<27, (7, 17, 20)>
<29, (9, 8, 17)>

Finally, count the total number of 3-stars: [10]
