Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in this given graph, we need to find all possible instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify nodes with degree 3:
   - Node 5, Node 9, Node 14, Node 17, Node 22, Node 23, Node 10, Node 0, Node 20, Node 28, Node 29, Node 4, Node 8, Node 19, Node 26, Node 13, Node 6, Node 16, Node 15, Node 7, Node 2, Node 12, Node 24, Node 25, Node 1, Node 27, Node 18, Node 3

2. For each node with degree 3, check if it forms a valid 3-star:
   - Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 22, and 0: <5, (9, 22, 0)>
   - Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 29, and 15: <9, (5, 29, 15)>
   - Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 11, and 1: <14, (17, 11, 1)>
   - Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 10, and 24: <17, (14, 10, 24)>
   - Node 22 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 23, and 8: <22, (5, 23, 8)>
   - Node 23 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 1, and 6: <23, (22, 1, 6)>
   - Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 15, and 18: <10, (17, 15, 18)>
   - Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 23, and 20: <0, (5, 23, 20)>
   - Node 20 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 28, and 11: <20, (0, 28, 11)>
   - Node 28 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 29, and 16: <28, (14, 29, 16)>
   - Node 29 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 28, and 7: <29, (9, 28, 7)>
   - Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 1, and 25: <4, (10, 1, 25)>
   - Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 22, 19, and 11: <8, (22, 19, 11)>
   - Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 26, and 3: <19, (8, 26, 3)>
   - Node 26 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 13, and 6: <26, (19, 13, 6)>
   - Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 26, 11, and 6: <13, (26, 11, 6)>
   - Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 23, 19, and 13: <6, (23, 19, 13)>
   - Node 16 forms a 3-star with nodes 28, 7, and 15: <16, (28, 7, 15)>
   - Node 15 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 10, and 28: <15, (9, 10, 28)>
   - Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 29, 16, and 11: <7, (29, 16, 11)>
   - Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 12, and 27: <2, (17, 12, 27)>
   - Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 11, and 14: <12, (2, 11, 14)>
   - Node 24 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 25, and 27: <24, (17, 25, 27)>
   - Node 25 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 24: <25, (9, 4, 24)>
   - Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 23, and 4: <1, (14, 23, 4)>
   - Node 27 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 21, and 18: <27, (17, 21, 18)>
   - Node 18 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 27, and 3: <18, (10, 27, 3)>

3. Count the number of 3-star graphs: 
   - The number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [27].

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
