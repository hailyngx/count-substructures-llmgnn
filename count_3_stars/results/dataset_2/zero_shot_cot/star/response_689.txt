Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes with 3 neighbors since they could be potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has neighbors 9, 3, and 10.
- Node 2 has neighbors 9, 1, and 8.
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 7, and 0.
- Node 5 has neighbors 10, 11, and 2.
- Node 6 has neighbors 7, 11, and 12.
- Node 8 has neighbors 10, 11, and 2.
- Node 12 has neighbors 6, 10, and 8.
- Node 13 has neighbors 9, 3, and 14.
- Node 14 has neighbors 9, 13, and 0.

Let's count the 3-stars using the identified potential centers:

1. Node 1:
  - <1, (9, 3, 10)>
  - <1, (9, 10, 2)>

2. Node 2:
  - <2, (9, 1, 8)>
  - <2, (1, 8, 10)>
  - <2, (1, 8, 12)>

3. Node 3:
  - <3, (1, 7, 0)>
  - <3, (13, 9, 3)>

4. Node 5:
  - <5, (10, 11, 2)>
  - <5, (11, 2, 4)>

5. Node 6:
  - <6, (7, 11, 12)>
  - <6, (12, 11, 8)>

6. Node 8:
  - <8, (10, 11, 2)>
  - <8, (10, 11, 12)>
  - <8, (2, 5, 11)>

7. Node 12:
  - <12, (6, 10, 8)>
  - <12, (12, 10, 5)>
  - <12, (8, 10, 11)>

8. Node 13:
  - <13, (9, 3, 14)>

9. Node 14:
  - <14, (9, 13, 0)>

Thus, there are [17] 3-stars in total.
