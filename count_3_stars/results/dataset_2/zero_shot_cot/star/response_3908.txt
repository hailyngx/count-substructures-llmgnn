Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 7) (7, 17) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 9) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (11, 5) (11, 19) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 13) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<3, (15, 5, 8)>
<17, (6, 0, 4)>
<2, (8, 3, 5)>
<5, (3, 2, 19)>
<19, (5, 9, 11)>
<4, (15, 17, 9)>
<16, (5, 1, 18)>
<1, (10, 16, 6)>
<6, (17, 8, 1)>
<11, (5, 19, 0)>
<14, (3, 18, 13)>
<0, (15, 17, 8)>
<13, (14, 18, 0)>
<18, (16, 1, 14)>

Thus, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
