Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the central nodes and their corresponding leaves.

Central Nodes:
- Node 5 has 4 adjacent nodes: 9, 13, 10
- Node 9 has 5 adjacent nodes: 5, 4, 14, 10, 13
- Node 1 has 5 adjacent nodes: 3, 11, 14, 0, 8
- Node 3 has 4 adjacent nodes: 1, 6, 2, 12
- Node 7 has 3 adjacent nodes: 11, 10, 8
- Node 12 has 5 adjacent nodes: 3, 2, 13, 0, 8
- Node 2 has 4 adjacent nodes: 3, 12, 11, 0
- Node 8 has 4 adjacent nodes: 1, 7, 12, 0
- Node 13 has 4 adjacent nodes: 5, 9, 12, 14
- Node 11 has 4 adjacent nodes: 1, 7, 2, 4
- Node 0 has 5 adjacent nodes: 1, 12, 2, 10, 6
- Node 10 has 5 adjacent nodes: 5, 9, 7, 0, 6
- Node 6 has 4 adjacent nodes: 3, 0, 10, 14
- Node 14 has 4 adjacent nodes: 9, 1, 13, 6
- Node 4 has 2 adjacent nodes: 9, 11

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 13, 10)>
<9, (5, 4, 14)>
<1, (3, 11, 14)>
<3, (1, 6, 2)>
<7, (11, 10, 8)>
<12, (3, 2, 13)>
<2, (3, 12, 11)>
<8, (1, 7, 12)>
<13, (5, 9, 12)>
<11, (1, 7, 2)>
<0, (1, 12, 2)>
<10, (5, 9, 7)>
<6, (3, 0, 14)>
<14, (9, 1, 13)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
