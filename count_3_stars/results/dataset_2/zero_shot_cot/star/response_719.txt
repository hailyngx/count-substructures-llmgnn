Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step-by-step:

1. Node 9:
<9, (5, 8, 2)>
<9, (8, 2, 0)>
<9, (7, 8, 6)>
<9, (2, 8, 3)>
<9, (0, 8, 3)>

2. Node 4:
<4, (3, 8, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<4, (7, 6, 1)>
<4, (8, 2, 0)>
<4, (3, 2, 1)>

3. Node 7:
<7, (6, 1, 4)>

4. Node 6:
<6, (0, 7, 1)>
<6, (2, 4, 1)>

5. Node 8:
<8, (9, 2, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 3)>
<8, (4, 0, 2)>
<8, (4, 3, 2)>

6. Node 2:
<2, (9, 4, 6)>

7. Node 0:
<0, (9, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>

8. Node 1:
<1, (6, 4, 2)>

9. Node 3:
<3, (4, 9, 0)>

10. Node 5:
<5, (9, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
