Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 5) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 7) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 13) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 16) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (11, 14) (11, 18) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 7) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 10) (19, 13) (19, 0) (6, 17) (6, 4) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (1, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes would be the centers of the 3-stars.

Based on the given edges, the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 17, 13, 1, and 7
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 5, 4, 10, and 19
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 13, and 6
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 14, 4, and 16
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 15, 8, and 2
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 16, and 19
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 15, 9, and 16
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 17, 5, and 10

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

There are <5, (15, 17, 13)>, <13, (8, 5, 4)>, <4, (18, 13, 6)>, <18, (14, 4, 16)>, <9, (15, 8, 2)>, <0, (9, 16, 19)>, <2, (15, 9, 16)>, and <7, (17, 5, 10)>.

Therefore, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
