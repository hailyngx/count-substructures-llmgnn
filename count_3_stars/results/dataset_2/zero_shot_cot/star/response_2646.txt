Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (4, 0, 3)>
<9, (6, 1, 0)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 4)>
<1, (9, 6, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (3, 8, 0)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. Counting the unique 3-stars listed above gives us a total of 9 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
