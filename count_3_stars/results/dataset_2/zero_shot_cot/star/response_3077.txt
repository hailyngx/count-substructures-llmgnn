Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list them step by step:

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 3, forming the 3-star <5, (8, 12, 3)>.
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 0, forming the 3-star <9, (8, 14, 0)>.
3. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 11, and 0, forming the 3-star <1, (3, 11, 0)>.
4. Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 14, and 12, forming the 3-star <11, (1, 14, 12)>.
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 7, forming the 3-star <4, (8, 13, 7)>.
6. Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 2, and 12, forming the 3-star <6, (10, 2, 12)>.
7. Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 12, forming the 3-star <13, (4, 7, 12)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<5, (8, 12, 3)>
<9, (8, 14, 0)>
<1, (3, 11, 0)>
<11, (1, 14, 12)>
<4, (8, 13, 7)>
<6, (10, 2, 12)>
<13, (4, 7, 12)>
