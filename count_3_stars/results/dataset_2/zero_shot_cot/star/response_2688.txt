Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 15) (22, 1) (9, 26) (26, 9) (26, 12) (6, 13) (6, 1) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 14) (7, 5) (21, 13) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 4) (21, 2) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 28) (18, 17) (8, 10) (8, 29) (8, 12) (23, 4) (23, 24) (23, 27) (28, 21) (28, 18) (28, 27) (29, 8) (29, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 24) (0, 11) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 20) (1, 22) (1, 6) (1, 10) (15, 22) (15, 16) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 15) (17, 18) (17, 3) (3, 17) (3, 12) (25, 24) (25, 2) (24, 23) (24, 0) (24, 25) (24, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 1) (12, 26) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (20, 13) (20, 19) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 27) (4, 21) (4, 23) (4, 29) (27, 23) (27, 28) (27, 11) (2, 21) (2, 25) (2, 24) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Looking at the given edges, we can identify potential 3-stars by checking nodes with exactly three neighbors.
2. Iterate through each node in the graph and check if it has exactly three neighbors. If so, form a 3-star with the node as the center and its neighbors as leaves.
3. Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.

Here are the unique 3-stars found and the final count:

<3, (17, 12, 11)>
<13, (22, 20, 21)>
<22, (13, 15, 18)>
<2, (21, 25, 24)>
<4, (23, 29, 21)>
<0, (14, 16, 24)>
<7, (21, 5, 16)>
<8, (12, 10, 29)>
<18, (22, 19, 28)>
<26, (9, 12, 22)>
<10, (5, 14, 8)>
<11, (18, 27, 12)>
<16, (15, 7, 0)>
<12, (26, 11, 8)>
<21, (13, 7, 28)>
<24, (23, 0, 25)>
<28, (21, 18, 27)>
<27, (23, 11, 28)>
<10, (1, 5, 14)>
<9, (26, 22, 12)>
