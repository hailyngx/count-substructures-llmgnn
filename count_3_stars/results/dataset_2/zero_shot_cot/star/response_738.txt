Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 15) (5, 16) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (19, 1) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 9) (15, 18) (15, 9) (15, 12) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 14) (14, 18) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 0) (7, 1) (9, 10) (9, 15) (9, 13) (1, 19) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 13) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <2, (3, 16, 18)>
2. <8, (0, 2, 17)>
3. <4, (10, 12, 13)>
4. <3, (2, 10, 11)>
5. <11, (3, 12, 14)>
6. <19, (1, 7, 14)>
7. <5, (8, 16, 17)>
8. <6, (8, 17, 4)>
9. <15, (9, 12, 18)>
10. <9, (10, 13, 15)>

Thus, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
