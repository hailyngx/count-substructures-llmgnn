Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 11) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 8) (9, 17) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 16) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 6) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 16) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 8) (16, 19) (16, 14) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs present in the given graph are as follows:

<0, (18, 4, 7)>
<1, (17, 14, 19)>
<3, (7, 13, 14)>
<4, (8, 12, 18)>
<7, (8, 0, 18)>
<8, (4, 8, 12)>
<11, (17, 13, 19)>
<12, (4, 8, 12)>
<13, (5, 11, 3)>
<14, (1, 3, 17)>
<15, (14, 18, 19)>
<16, (14, 16, 19)>
<17, (1, 9, 11)>
<18, (0, 15, 18)>
<19, (1, 11, 15)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
