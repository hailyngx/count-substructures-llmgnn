Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (15, 16) (14, 17) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 27) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 10) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 20) (21, 5) (1, 8) (22, 2) (22, 10) (23, 14) (23, 8) (23, 9) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 16) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 6) (29, 26) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 27) (9, 23) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 19) (25, 14) (25, 18) (25, 2) (27, 17) (27, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 5) (2, 14) (2, 22) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 21) (5, 16) (5, 26) (5, 4) (26, 29) (26, 5) (26, 12) (10, 7) (10, 22) (10, 24) (12, 26) (12, 24) (20, 21) (20, 18) (20, 4) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 16) (0, 11) (0, 24) (0, 18) (0, 13) (24, 15) (24, 10) (24, 12) (24, 0) (24, 4) (4, 5) (4, 20) (4, 24) (18, 25) (18, 20) (18, 0) (19, 28) (19, 9) (13, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes and their neighboring nodes. Once we find a central node connected to exactly 3 other nodes, we will have a 3-star.

Central Node: 
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3, 21, and 16
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 23, and 2
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and 20
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 23, and 16
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 28, 9, and 6
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 3, 27, and 0
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 23, 29, and 2
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 14, 18, and 2
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 15, 8, and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 14, 9, and 25
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 21, 16, and 26
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 7, 22, and 24
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 24, and 18
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 15, 10, and 12
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 20, and 24
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 25, 20, and 0
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 28 and 9 (not a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 13 is connected to node 0 (not a 3-star as it has only 1 neighbor)

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <15, (3, 21, 16)>, <14, (17, 23, 2)>, <21, (15, 7, 20)>, <8, (1, 23, 16)>
