This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 10) (29, 2) (29, 1) (29, 27) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 22) (17, 18) (10, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 26) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 28) (21, 8) (1, 29) (1, 6) (1, 27) (3, 24) (3, 23) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 27) (4, 26) (8, 21) (8, 4) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 22) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 22) (9, 16) (22, 17) (22, 0) (22, 9) (13, 12) (13, 15) (26, 11) (26, 4) (27, 29) (27, 1) (27, 4) (15, 13) (15, 25) (15, 28) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 15) (23, 3) (23, 25) (23, 20) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 12) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 25) (16, 9) (16, 25) (19, 2) (19, 10) (5, 3) (5, 24) (5, 20) (24, 3) (24, 5) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 8) (20, 23) (20, 5) (25, 15) (25, 23) (25, 12) (25, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node in the 3-stars. From the list of edges provided, we can see that the central node has the following connections:

- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 19, and 10.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 1, 27, and 2.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 17, 0, and 18.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 14, 6, and 9.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 28, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 28.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 29, 6, and 27.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 24, 23, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 27.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 18, and 21.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 17, 3, and 22.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 17, 0, and 9.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 12 and 15.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 11 and 4.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 29, 1, and 4.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 13, 25, and 28.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 15.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 3, 25, and 20.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 17, 1, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 6, and 25.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 9 and 25.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 2 and 10.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 24, and 20.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 8.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 23, 5, and 20.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 15, 23, 12, and 16.

Next, we need to identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<2, (4, 19, 10)>
<29, (1, 27, 2)>
<14, (17, 0, 18)>
<17, (14, 6, 9)>
<10, (2, 11, 7)>
<11, (10, 28, 7)>
<7, (10, 11, 28)>
<1, (29, 6, 27)>
<3, (24, 23, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 27)>
<8, (4, 18, 21)>
<9, (17, 3, 22)>
<22, (17, 0, 9)>
<13, (12, 15)>
<26, (11, 4)>
<27, (29, 1, 4)>
<15, (13, 25, 28)>
<28, (11, 7, 15)>
<23, (3, 25, 20)>
<6, (17, 1, 12)>
<12, (13, 6, 25)>
<16, (9, 25)>
<19, (2, 10)>
<5, (3, 24, 20)>
<24, (3, 5)>
<18, (14, 17, 8)>
<20, (23, 5, 20)>
<25, (15, 23, 12, 16)>

Now, counting the number of 3-stars in the graph: [29]
