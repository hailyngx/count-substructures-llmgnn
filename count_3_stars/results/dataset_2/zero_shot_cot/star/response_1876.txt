Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 13) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 12) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 12) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars present in the graph. 

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- For each node, check if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. If this condition is met, then that node is the center of a 3-star.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<5, (8, 0, 7)>
<9, (11, 7, 3)>
<4, (0, 6, 2)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<10, (11, 0, 12)>
<11, (9, 10, 3)>
<0, (5, 4, 10)>
<14, (0, 6, 13)>
<2, (4, 10, 13)>
<8, (5, 0, 6)>
<3, (9, 7, 11)>
<1, (7, 11, 12)>
<6, (4, 11, 14)>
<12, (10, 3, 1)>
<13, (7, 0, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
