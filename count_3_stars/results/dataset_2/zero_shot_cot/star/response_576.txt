Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 19) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 2) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 4) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 4) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 18) (11, 5) (11, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 15) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars. 
Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes: 5, 6, 1, 19, 0, 16, and 4.

Next, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph by checking each potential center node along with its connected nodes.

<5, (6, 11, 1)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<1, (6, 19, 4)>
<19, (1, 10, 4)>
<0, (8, 16, 12)>
<16, (9, 0, 4)>
<4, (19, 16, 12)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
