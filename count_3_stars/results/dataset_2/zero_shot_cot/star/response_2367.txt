Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 28) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 13) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 26) (3, 29) (25, 26) (25, 28) (25, 22) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 29) (15, 20) (15, 29) (15, 24) (21, 19) (28, 5) (28, 25) (28, 24) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 7) (29, 3) (29, 20) (29, 15) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 0) (23, 11) (23, 24) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 22) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 12) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 14) (4, 6) (22, 25) (22, 8) (22, 16) (22, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 16) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 26) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 27) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 2) (16, 26) (24, 15) (24, 28) (24, 23) (24, 4) (6, 4) (7, 13) (7, 17) (7, 1) (27, 1) (14, 4) (26, 3) (26, 25) (26, 12) (26, 16) (18, 12) (18, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the possible 3-star configurations in the given graph:
- Node 5 can form a 3-star with nodes 13, 28, 3 as leaves.
- Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 11, 13, 7 as leaves.
- Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 10, 26 as leaves.
- Node 25 can form a 3-star with nodes 26, 28, 22 as leaves.
- Node 20 can form a 3-star with nodes 15, 17, 29 as leaves.
- Node 15 can form a 3-star with nodes 20, 24, 29 as leaves.
- Node 21 doesn't form a 3-star as it does not have exactly 3 connections.
- Node 28 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 25, 24 as leaves.
- Node 13 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, 4 as leaves.
- Node 17 can form a 3-star with nodes 20, 16, 7 as leaves.
- Node 29 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 20, 15 as leaves.
- Node 11 can form a 3-star with nodes 9, 23, 0 as leaves.
- Node 23 can form a 3-star with nodes 11, 24, 0 as leaves.
- Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 19, 12, 22 as leaves.
- Node 19 can form a 3-star with nodes 21, 8, 12 as leaves.
- Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 13, 24, 14 as leaves.
- Node 22 can form a 3-star with nodes 25, 8, 16 as leaves.
- Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 12, 1, 16 as leaves.
- Node 12 can form a 3-star with nodes 8, 19, 2 as leaves.
- Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 11, 22, 10 as leaves.
- Node 10 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 13, 0 as leaves.
- Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 2, 7, 27 as leaves.
- Node 16 can form a 3-star with nodes 17, 22, 2 as leaves.
- Node 24 can form a 3-star with nodes 15, 28, 23 as leaves.

Therefore, the <5, (13, 28, 3)>, <9, (11, 13, 7)>, <3, (5, 10, 26)>, <25, (26, 28, 22)>, <20, (15, 17, 29)>, <15, (20, 24, 29)>, <28, (5, 25, 24)>, <13, (5, 9, 4)>, <17, (20, 16, 7)>, <29, (3, 20, 15)>, <11, (9, 23, 0)>, <23, (11, 24, 0)>, <8, (19, 12, 22)>, <19, (21, 8, 12)>, <4, (13, 24, 14)>, <22, (25, 8, 16)>, <2, (12, 1, 16)>, <12, (8, 19, 2)>, <0, (11, 22, 10)>, <10, (3, 13, 0)>, <1, (2, 7, 27)>, <16, (17, 22, 2)>, <24, (15, 28, 23)> are the unique 3-stars found.

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is therefore [24].
