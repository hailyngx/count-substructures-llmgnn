Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

- The node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 3, and 8, forming a 3-star <4, (5, 9, 3)>.
- The node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 8, and 7, forming a 3-star <1, (0, 3, 8)>.

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
