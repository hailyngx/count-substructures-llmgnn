Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 13) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 11) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 2) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Starting with node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 14, and 8. This forms a 3-star: <6, (9, 1, 14)>.

2. Moving to node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, 14, and 12. This forms a 3-star: <9, (6, 4, 14)>.
- Node 9 is also part of the 3-star already identified with center node 6.

3. Moving to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 13. While these edges do not form a 3-star, we can ignore this case.

4. Moving through the remaining nodes, we don't find any more 3-stars.

Thus, the count of unique 3-stars in the given graph is 2.
Therefore, the final answer is [2].
