Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 2) (27, 4) (27, 21) (27, 7) (27, 26) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 21) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 29) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 20) (20, 13) (25, 9) (25, 6) (6, 25) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 24) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 22) (28, 10) (2, 15) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 16) (22, 17) (22, 28) (22, 26) (22, 7) (22, 12) (26, 27) (26, 13) (26, 22) (26, 10) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 24) (21, 27) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 16) (9, 14) (9, 25) (12, 22) (12, 19) (16, 2) (16, 21) (16, 18) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 3) (18, 1) (19, 2) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 3) (24, 6) (24, 4) (24, 0) (24, 10) (10, 28) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 24) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (1, 14) (1, 18) (1, 7) (11, 5) (3, 18) (3, 19) (3, 5) (7, 27) (7, 22) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 24) (29, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars by looking for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.

Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 13 (connected to 14, 8, 20)
- Node 6 (connected to 25, 28, 24)
- Node 2 (connected to 15, 8, 5)
- Node 22 (connected to 17, 28, 26)
- Node 4 (connected to 27, 0, 24)
- Node 21 (connected to 27, 17, 6)
- Node 10 (connected to 28, 26, 19)
- Node 1 (connected to 14, 18, 7)
- Node 19 (connected to 2, 12, 18)
- Node 3 (connected to 18, 19, 5)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

[There are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]

<13, (14, 8, 20)>
<6, (25, 28, 24)>
<2, (15, 8, 5)>
<22, (17, 28, 26)>
<4, (27, 0, 24)>
<21, (27, 17, 6)>
<10, (28, 26, 19)>
<1, (14, 18, 7)>
<19, (2, 12, 18)>
<3, (18, 19, 5)>
