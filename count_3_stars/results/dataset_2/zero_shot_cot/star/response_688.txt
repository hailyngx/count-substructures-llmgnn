Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 1) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 15) (19, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (4, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 14) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 10) (10, 13) (10, 19) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 16) (16, 9) (16, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars first. Let's start by listing all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (8, 9, 10)>
<2, (0, 15, 18)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 6, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (1, 12, 14)>
<9, (1, 10, 16)>
<10, (13, 10, 19)>
<11, (6, 11, 18)>
<12, (8, 12, 17)>
<13, (8, 13, 15)>
<14, (1, 12, 14)>
<15, (13, 14, 15)>
<16, (9, 10, 16)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars by counting the unique 3-stars:
