Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 17) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 11) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 23) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 15) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 27) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 28) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 21) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 13) (15, 12) (3, 20) (17, 22) (17, 5) (25, 21) (25, 10) (25, 2) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 29) (7, 2) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 23) (16, 18) (16, 29) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 13) (20, 18) (20, 1) (20, 3) (20, 12) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 7) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 29) (6, 14) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 20) (27, 21) (27, 28) (13, 0) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 24) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 19) (9, 1) (9, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected in a star-like pattern where one node is at the center and is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars:

<0, (22, 13, 23)>
<1, (15, 9, 20)>
<2, (19, 7, 25)>
<4, (8, 5, 10)>
<5, (4, 17, 7)>
<8, (4, 11, 24)>
<10, (4, 25, 19)>
<11, (18, 8, 28)>
<13, (0, 15, 24)>
<15, (1, 23, 13)>
<18, (22, 16, 20)>
<19, (22, 10, 13)>
<21, (28, 25, 27)>
<22, (18, 19, 0)>
<24, (8, 12, 13)>
<25, (21, 10, 2)>
<27, (21, 28, 5)>
<28, (21, 27, 11)>
<29, (7, 23, 16)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [19].
