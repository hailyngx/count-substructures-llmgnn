Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 19) (7, 25) (7, 15) (7, 5) (21, 10) (21, 12) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 20) (22, 26) (22, 20) (22, 3) (1, 25) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 22) (3, 13) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 27) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 11) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 25) (26, 22) (26, 16) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 23) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 28) (2, 14) (19, 9) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 12) (0, 29) (16, 6) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 20) (24, 16) (24, 28) (24, 14) (15, 9) (15, 7) (23, 27) (23, 28) (29, 8) (29, 19) (29, 0) (29, 13) (14, 2) (14, 24) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 27) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (20, 16) (20, 28) (12, 21) (12, 1) (12, 25) (12, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 4) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 23) (28, 20) 

Response:
The task is to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. Let's do this step-by-step.

Step 1: Identify Nodes Connected to Exactly Three Other Nodes
Based on the given edges, let's list the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 12, and 25.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 13, 22, and 26.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 17.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 19.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and no other nodes.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 6, 20, and 26.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 29.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 16, 18, and 28.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 23.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 20, 23, and 25.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 19.

Step 2: Count the Number of Unique 3-Stars
Based on the nodes found, we can list the unique 3-stars:
1. <1, (4, 12, 25)>
2. <3, (13, 22, 26)>
3. <5, (4, 7, 17)>
4. <9, (8, 13, 19)>
5. <16, (6, 20, 26)>
6. <19, (9, 12, 29)>
7. <20, (16, 18, 28)>
8. <27, (10, 11, 23)>
9. <28, (20, 23, 25)>
10. <29, (0, 8, 19)>

Step 3: Count the Total Number of 3-Stars
Total number of 3-stars: [10]
