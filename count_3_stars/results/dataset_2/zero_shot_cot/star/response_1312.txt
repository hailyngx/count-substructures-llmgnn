Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 2 is the center node and it is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 8: <2, (9, 3, 8)>
2. Node 4 is the center node and it is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 1: <4, (5, 6, 1)>
3. Node 6 is the center node and it is connected to nodes 5, 1, and 0: <6, (5, 1, 0)>
4. Node 7 is the center node and it is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 0: <7, (5, 9, 0)>
5. Node 8 is the center node and it is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 7: <8, (9, 3, 7)>

Thus, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [5].
