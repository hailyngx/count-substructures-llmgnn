Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 4) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, let's analyze the nodes one by one to identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 0)>.
- Node 9: <9, (4, 10, 14)>.
- Node 1: No 3-star as it only has one edge.
- Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 12)>.
- Node 10: <10, (9, 1, 11)>.
- Node 11: <11, (10, 6, 8)>.
- Node 8: No 3-star as it only has two edges.
- Node 13: No 3-star as it only has two edges.
- Node 2: No 3-star as it only has three edges.
- Node 0: <0, (3, 13, 2)>.
- Node 14: No 3-star as it only has three edges.
- Node 6: <6, (11, 14, 4)>.
- Node 12: <12, (9, 1, 13)>.
- Node 7: <7, (8, 2, 3)>.
- Node 4: <4, (5, 9, 6)>.

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (2, 4, 0)>, <9, (4, 10, 14)>, <3, (0, 4, 12)>, <10, (9, 1, 11)>, <11, (10, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 13, 2)>, <6, (11, 14, 4)>, and <12, (9, 1, 13)>.
