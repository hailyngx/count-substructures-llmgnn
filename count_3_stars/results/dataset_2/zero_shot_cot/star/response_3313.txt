Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 1) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
The key observation here is that a 3-star involves a center node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Since the center node is connected to three leaves, any node participating as a leaf in a 3-star must already have at least degree two (i.e., must be connected to at least two other nodes) to form three connections with the center node.

Let's proceed step-by-step to find all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Identify nodes with degree at least two:
    - Node 4 (degree 4)
    - Node 7 (degree 1)
    - Node 5 (degree 4)
    - Node 6 (degree 4)
    - Node 2 (degree 4)
    - Node 8 (degree 3)
    - Node 3 (degree 4)
    - Node 11 (degree 5)
    - Node 12 (degree 6)
    - Node 1 (degree 4)
    - Node 0 (degree 3)
    - Node 10 (degree 4)
    - Node 14 (degree 4)
    - Node 9 (degree 5)
    - Node 13 (degree 5)

2. Find the 3-stars formed by each of these nodes as the center:
   - Node 4: <4, (7, 9, 14)>
   - Node 5: <5, (6, 8, 12)>
   - Node 6: <6, (5, 2, 8)>
   - Node 2: <2, (6, 9, 13)>
   - Node 8: <8, (5, 6, 3)>
   - Node 3: <3, (8, 11, 14)>
   - Node 11: <11, (3, 9, 13)>
   - Node 12: <12, (4, 5, 3)>
   - Node 1: <1, (12, 9, 0)>
   - Node 0: <0, (2, 1, 9)>
   - Node 10: <10, (5, 2, 12)>
   - Node 14: <14, (4, 3, 11)>
   - Node 9: <9, (4, 2, 11)>
   - Node 13: <13, (6, 2, 11)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars:
   - There are 14 unique 3-stars found.
   
Therefore, the number 3-stars in the graph is [14].
