Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. First, let's list all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 1, 10, and 11 (5 connections).
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 3, 11, 0, 12, and 9 (6 connections).

2. Next, let's identify the 3-star patterns:
- For node 8, the 3-star patterns are: <8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (7, 10, 11)>, and <8, (1, 10, 5)>.
- For node 13, the 3-star patterns are: <13, (7, 3, 11)>, <13, (3, 12, 2)>, and <13, (11, 6, 5)>.

3. Now, we can count the unique 3-stars found:
<8, (4, 7, 1)>, <8, (7, 10, 11)>, <8, (1, 10, 5)>, <13, (7, 3, 11)>, <13, (3, 12, 2)>, <13, (11, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
