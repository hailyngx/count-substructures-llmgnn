Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 4) (16, 20) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 20) (13, 22) (13, 2) (22, 13) (22, 14) (22, 15) (22, 12) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 27) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 3) (26, 27) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 1) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 18) (7, 0) (7, 20) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 28) (23, 11) (23, 5) (25, 11) (25, 21) (25, 15) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 6) (14, 29) (28, 8) (18, 9) (18, 0) (3, 26) (3, 0) (3, 27) (24, 2) (24, 29) (19, 4) (20, 16) (20, 9) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 10) (12, 22) (12, 20) (12, 15) (15, 22) (15, 25) (15, 12) (4, 16) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 10) (29, 26) (29, 14) (29, 24) (10, 20) (10, 4) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 24) (2, 27) (27, 6) (27, 26) (27, 3) (27, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes with 3 connections.
- Node 1: (16, 5, 17)
- Node 2: (13, 22, 7)
- Node 3: (26, 0, 27)
- Node 4: (16, 21, 19)
- Node 5: (9, 6, 1)
- Node 6: (5, 14, 27)
- Node 7: (0, 2, 8)
- Node 9: (5, 18, 20)
- Node 10: (20, 4)
- Node 11: (16, 23, 14)
- Node 12: (22, 20, 15)
- Node 14: (22, 6, 29)
- Node 15: (22, 25, 12)
- Node 16: (11, 1, 20)
- Node 20: (16, 9, 7, 12, 10)
- Node 21: (26, 25, 4)
- Node 22: (13, 14, 15, 12)
- Node 26: (29, 21, 3, 27)
- Node 27: (6, 3, 2, 26)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1 <3, (26, 0, 27)>
- Node 4: 0
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 0
- Node 7: 0
- Node 9: 0
- Node 10: 0
- Node 11: 1 <11, (16, 23, 14)>
- Node 12: 0
- Node 14: 1 <14, (22, 6, 29)>
- Node 15: 0
- Node 16: 0
- Node 20: 2 <20, (16, 9, 7)>, <20, (12, 10, 4)>
- Node 21: 0
- Node 22: 2 <22, (13, 14, 15)>, <22, (12, 20, 15)>
- Node 26: 0
- Node 27: 1 <27, (6, 3, 26)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
