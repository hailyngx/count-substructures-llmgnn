Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

- Node 4 is connected to 8, 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 7 is connected to 2 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to 4, 9, 1, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to 6, 8, 2, and 3.
- Node 8 is connected to 4, 7, 9, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to 4, 8, 1, and 0.
- Node 2 is connected to 7, 9, and 1.
- Node 0 is connected to 4, 5, 3, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to 6, 9, 5, 2, and 0.
- Node 3 is connected to 6, 9, 5, and 0.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by looking at the nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star:

- Node 4 forms a 3-star with leaf nodes 8, 5, and 6. (<4, (8, 5, 6)>)
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaf nodes 9, 1, and 3. (<6, (9, 1, 3)>)
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with leaf nodes 8, 2, and 3. (<9, (8, 2, 3)>)
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with leaf nodes 4, 7, and 5. (<8, (4, 7, 5)>)
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with leaf nodes 4, 8, and 1. (<5, (4, 8, 1)>)
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with leaf nodes 6, 9, and 5. (<1, (6, 9, 5)>)
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaf nodes 6, 9, and 5. (<3, (6, 9, 5)>)

So, there are [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
