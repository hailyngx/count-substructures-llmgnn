Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 22) (21, 24) (20, 1) (20, 26) (20, 13) (20, 10) (25, 6) (25, 18) (2, 22) (2, 11) (29, 22) (29, 18) (12, 7) (12, 15) (5, 13) (5, 10) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 8) (6, 16) (9, 8) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 29) (13, 20) (13, 5) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 26) (18, 25) (18, 29) (18, 26) (18, 3) (26, 20) (26, 0) (26, 18) (26, 17) (10, 21) (10, 20) (10, 5) (15, 12) (15, 17) (15, 28) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 19) (8, 27) (19, 8) (19, 1) (19, 16) (19, 23) (24, 21) (24, 6) (24, 11) (24, 27) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 24) (14, 1) (14, 23) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 17) (17, 26) (17, 15) (17, 3) (1, 7) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 14) (28, 0) (28, 15) (23, 19) (23, 14) (27, 21) (27, 8) (27, 24) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, 
we need to find the nodes that are connected in a 3-star pattern, where one node is the center and the other three nodes are connected to the center node.

Let's list the 3-stars found in this graph:
<4, (7, 16, 11)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<21, (10, 27, 22)>
<20, (1, 26, 13)>
<25, (6, 18, -)>
<2, (22, 11, -)>
<29, (22, 18, -)>
<12, (7, 15, -)>
<5, (13, 10, -)>
<6, (25, 24, 8)>
<8, (6, 9, 19)>
<22, (21, 2, 29)>
<13, (20, 5, -)>
<0, (7, 28, 26)>
<18, (25, 29, 3)>
<26, (20, 0, 18)>
<10, (21, 20, 5)>
<15, (12, 17, 28)>
<9, (8, -, -)>
<19, (8, 1, 16)>
<24, (21, 6, 11)>
<11, (4, 2, 24)>
<14, (1, 23, -)>
<3, (4, 18, 17)>
<17, (26, 15, 3)>
<1, (7, 20, 19)>
<28, (0, 15, -)>
<23, (19, 14, -)>
<27, (21, 8, 24)>
<16, (4, 6, 19)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: 
[29]
