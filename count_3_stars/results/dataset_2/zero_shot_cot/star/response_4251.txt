Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's start by listing all the 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (6, 2, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 8, 2)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<9, (1, 5, 7)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in total. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
