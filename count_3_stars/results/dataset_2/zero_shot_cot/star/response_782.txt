Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 11) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 14) (13, 11) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<1, (2, 4, 10)>
<2, (1, 11, 14)>
<3, (5, 7, 14)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 10)>
<6, (4, 5, 12)>
<7, (3, 9, 11)>
<8, (5, 9, 14)>
<9, (4, 7, 10)>
<10, (1, 5, 9)>
<11, (1, 2, 7)>
<12, (6, 7, 9)>
<14, (2, 8, 4)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
