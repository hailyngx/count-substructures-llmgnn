Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 20) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 19) (2, 16) (2, 13) (2, 25) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 1) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 21) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 13) (28, 23) (24, 22) (24, 29) (20, 11) (20, 19) (29, 24) (29, 0) (29, 4) (10, 18) (10, 8) (10, 14) (15, 25) (25, 2) (25, 15) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 8) (27, 25) (27, 3) (27, 9) (27, 1) (17, 16) (17, 25) (17, 3) (23, 28) (23, 21) (3, 5) (3, 27) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 8) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 22) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 14) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 25) (8, 3) (7, 1) (21, 5) (21, 23) (21, 9) (9, 27) (9, 21) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 0) (13, 2) (13, 28) (19, 16) (19, 20) (19, 12) (0, 6) (0, 29) (0, 4) (0, 1) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 1) (1, 18) (1, 27) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its three connected nodes in each 3-star configuration. 

Let's start by listing the 3-star configurations in the given graph:

<1, (7, 12, 18)>
<2, (13, 16, 25)>
<3, (8, 17, 27)>
<4, (0, 11, 29)>
<5, (6, 8, 21)>
<6, (0, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 9, 27)>
<8, (6, 8, 10)>
<9, (9, 21, 27)>
<10, (10, 14, 18)>
<11, (4, 11, 20)>
<12, (12, 19, 28)>
<13, (2, 13, 28)>
<14, (1, 14, 22)>
<15, (15, 17, 25)>
<16, (16, 17, 19)>
<17, (3, 17, 25)>
<18, (1, 10, 18)>
<19, (16, 19, 20)>
<20, (11, 19, 20)>
<21, (5, 9, 21)>
<22, (8, 14, 22)>
<23, (21, 23, 28)>
<24, (22, 24, 29)>
<25, (2, 15, 25)>
<26, (17, 25, 27)>
<27, (1, 3, 27)>
<28, (12, 13, 28)>
<29, (0, 4, 29)>
<30, (21, 23, 28)>

There are a total of 30 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [30].
