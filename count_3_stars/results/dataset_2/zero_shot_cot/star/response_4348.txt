Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph. 

We will examine each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. A 3-star consists of the center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Node 5:
- (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8)
<5, (9, 2, 8)>

Node 9:
- (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 4)
<9, (5, 8, 4)>

Node 6:
- (6, 7), (6, 3), (6, 2)

Node 4:
- (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 7)
<4, (9, 6, 7)>

Node 7:
- (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 4)

Node 1:
- (1, 5), (1, 0)

Node 3:
- (3, 9), (3, 6), (3, 7)
<3, (9, 6, 7)>

Node 8:
- (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 4)
<8, (5, 9, 4)>

Node 2:
- (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8)

Node 0:
- (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 1)

The unique 3-stars found are: <<5, (9, 2, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>, <4, (9, 6, 7)>, <3, (9, 6, 7)>, <8, (5, 9, 4)>>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
