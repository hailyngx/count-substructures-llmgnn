Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 4) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 29) (27, 10) (27, 28) (18, 22) (18, 21) (18, 1) (22, 18) (22, 11) (22, 20) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 11) (29, 27) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 14) (9, 16) (9, 23) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 15) (5, 13) (5, 26) (5, 24) (13, 5) (13, 25) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 20) (20, 22) (20, 1) (20, 6) (23, 29) (23, 9) (23, 11) (23, 28) (8, 14) (8, 26) (19, 21) (25, 13) (25, 12) (25, 28) (28, 27) (28, 23) (28, 25) (28, 15) (6, 20) (6, 15) (24, 5) (26, 5) (26, 8) (26, 14) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 25) (12, 16) (14, 29) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 7) (14, 2) (2, 0) (2, 17) (2, 14) (4, 0) (4, 21) (21, 0) (21, 18) (21, 19) (21, 4) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 15) (15, 11) (15, 28) (15, 6) (15, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (27, 21, 4)>
<27, (0, 29, 10)>
<18, (22, 21, 1)>
<22, (18, 11, 20)>
<17, (29, 1, 2)>
<29, (27, 17, 23)>
<9, (16, 23, 12)>
<3, (11, 10, 15)>
<11, (22, 17, 3)>
<5, (13, 26, 24)>
<13, (5, 25, 28)>
<1, (18, 17, 20)>
<20, (22, 1, 6)>
<23, (29, 9, 11)>
<8, (14, 26, 7)>
<25, (13, 12, 28)>
<6, (20, 15, 1)>
<12, (25, 16, 28)>
<7, (14, 16, 2)>
<4, (0, 21, 27)>
<10, (27, 3, 15)>

Therefore, there are [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
