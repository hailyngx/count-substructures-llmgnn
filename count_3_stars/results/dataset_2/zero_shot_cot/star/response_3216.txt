Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 27) (15, 1) (27, 15) (27, 0) (27, 21) (27, 2) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (1, 15) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 13) (21, 27) (21, 0) (21, 29) (26, 1) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 17) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 25) (29, 21) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 11) (10, 4) (10, 23) (10, 5) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 9) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 16) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 22) (4, 2) (22, 3) (22, 4) (22, 11) (22, 24) (25, 17) (25, 6) (16, 5) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 20) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (24, 9) (24, 13) (2, 27) (2, 4) (2, 13) (20, 26) (20, 16) (20, 18) (8, 0) (8, 24) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 7) (12, 14) (12, 18) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 2) (11, 26) (11, 29) (11, 22) (28, 7) (7, 9) (7, 28) (18, 20) (18, 12) (23, 29) (23, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll identify all the occurrences where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. This corresponds to the definition of a 3-star graph.

Here are the 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (15, 17, 22)>
<15, (3, 1, 27)>
<27, (15, 0, 21)>
<1, (15, 26, 6)>
<21, (27, 0, 29)>
<26, (1, 17, 11)>
<17, (3, 26, 29)>
<29, (21, 17, 23)>
<10, (4, 23, 5)>
<5, (10, 19, 16)>
<19, (5, 4, 9)>
<4, (10, 19, 22)>
<22, (3, 4, 11)>
<16, (5, 6, 24)>
<24, (22, 16, 8)>
<2, (27, 4, 13)>
<20, (26, 16, 18)>
<8, (0, 24, 13)>
<9, (19, 24, 7)>
<12, (14, 18)>
<13, (1, 24, 2)>
<11, (26, 29, 22)>
<7, (9, 28)>
<18, (20, 12)>
<23, (29, 10)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
