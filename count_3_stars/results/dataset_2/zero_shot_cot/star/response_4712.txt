Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 25) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (26, 10) (26, 11) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 24) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 10) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 27) (0, 11) (27, 0) (27, 14) (3, 25) (3, 8) (25, 22) (25, 3) (25, 12) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 17) (4, 22) (4, 8) (4, 23) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 20) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 10) (15, 10) (15, 2) (10, 26) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 15) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 12) (29, 20) (18, 8) (18, 28) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 24) (24, 6) (24, 19) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 0) (11, 8) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 17) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 14) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 16) (12, 9) (12, 25) (12, 20) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all unique occurrences where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (11, 13, 22)>
<1, (5, 9, 10)>
<2, (5, 14, 16)>
<3, (8, 12, 25)>
<4, (8, 22, 23)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (9, 24, 28)>
<7, (5, 7, 19)>
<8, (3, 4, 8)>
<10, (15, 21, 26)>
<11, (0, 8, 22)>
<12, (8, 12, 25)>
<14, (2, 14, 27)>
<15, (10, 15, 26)>
<16, (1, 14, 16)>
<17, (5, 16, 17)>
<18, (18, 19, 28)>
<19, (7, 18, 19)>
<20, (12, 20, 28)>
<21, (7, 10, 21)>
<22, (0, 13, 22)>
<23, (4, 17, 23)>
<24, (6, 19, 24)>
<25, (3, 12, 25)>
<26, (10, 11, 26)>
<27, (0, 14, 27)>
<28, (6, 18, 28)>
<29, (20, 28, 29)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [28]
