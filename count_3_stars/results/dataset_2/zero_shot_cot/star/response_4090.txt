Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 8) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 8) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 13.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 11.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 13.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 6.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For Node 0: <0, (3, 4, 13)>
- For Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 10)>
- For Node 6: <6, (4, 9, 11)>
- For Node 7: <7, (5, 8, 13)>
- For Node 12: <12, (5, 8, 6)>
- For Node 14: <14, (2, 4, 8)>

As there is one 3-star for each of the identified nodes, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
