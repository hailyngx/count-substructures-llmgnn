Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 23) (9, 6) (9, 21) (14, 28) (14, 29) (17, 11) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 26) (23, 6) (23, 8) (23, 18) (23, 7) (23, 28) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 27) (2, 4) (18, 23) (18, 2) (18, 28) (18, 25) (15, 20) (15, 16) (15, 12) (15, 4) (20, 8) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 16) (20, 19) (24, 26) (24, 11) (26, 8) (26, 24) (26, 25) (28, 14) (28, 23) (28, 18) (16, 15) (16, 20) (21, 9) (21, 0) (21, 27) (12, 2) (12, 15) (12, 29) (12, 3) (11, 17) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 7) (19, 20) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 13) (22, 20) (22, 19) (1, 11) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 10) (29, 14) (29, 12) (29, 1) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 11) (7, 5) (0, 21) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 10) (4, 2) (4, 15) (4, 19) (27, 2) (27, 21) (27, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 13) (5, 7) (13, 19) (13, 27) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph. Here is the list of unique 3-stars found: 

<6, (9, 7, 23)>
<14, (28, 29, 12)>
<17, (11, 24, 1)>
<8, (23, 20, 26)>
<18, (23, 2, 28)>
<15, (20, 16, 12)>
<21, (9, 0, 27)>
<4, (2, 15, 19)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
