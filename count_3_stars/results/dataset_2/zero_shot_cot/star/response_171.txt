Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by finding the number of times a node is at the center of a 3-star. 

Looking at the edges of the graph, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 are at the center of some 3-stars. Let's count the number of unique 3-stars for each central node:

- Node 1: (1, 6, 7), (1, 6, 8), (1, 2, 9), (1, 7, 8) [4 unique 3-stars]
- Node 2: (2, 4, 8), (2, 4, 5), (2, 1, 3) [3 unique 3-stars]
- Node 3: (3, 5, 7), (3, 2, 0) [2 unique 3-stars]
- Node 4: (4, 6, 8), (4, 6, 7), (4, 2, 0), (4, 7, 3) [4 unique 3-stars]
- Node 5: (5, 9, 2), (5, 8, 3), (5, 8, 9), (5, 3, 7) [4 unique 3-stars]
- Node 8: (8, 0, 4), (8, 4, 2), (8, 0, 1), (8, 1, 5) [4 unique 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21]. 

So, the final answer is [21]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 9, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 6)>
<1, (6, 8, 7)>
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 2)>
<2, (1, 3, 2)>
<3, (5, 7, 3)>
<3, (2, 0, 3)>
<4, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (6, 7, 4)>
<4, (2, 0, 4)>
<4, (7, 3, 4)>
<5, (9, 2, 5)>
<5, (8, 3, 5)>
<5, (8, 9, 5)>
<5, (3, 7, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 8)>
<8, (4, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 8)>
