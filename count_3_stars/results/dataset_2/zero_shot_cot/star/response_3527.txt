Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 17) (6, 3) (6, 5) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 13) (7, 19) (7, 10) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 18) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 2) (5, 15) (5, 6) (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 12) (2, 19) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18) (14, 1) (14, 18) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (18, 1) (18, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. <2, (9, 12, 17)>
2. <5, (6, 9, 15)>
3. <8, (0, 12, 13)>
4. <10, (5, 17, 18)>
5. <13, (0, 8, 18)>

There are 5 unique 3-stars found in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
