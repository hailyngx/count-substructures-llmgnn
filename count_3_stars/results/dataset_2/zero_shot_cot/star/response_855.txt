Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify unique sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go through the nodes one by one.

Nodes connected to 3 other nodes:
- Node 0: (0, 5), (0, 9), (0, 13)
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 11), (1, 2)
- Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 5), (4, 9), (4, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 10)
- Node 11: (11, 4), (11, 1), (11, 13)

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 9, 13)>
<1, (3, 11, 2)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (5, 4, 10)>
<11, (4, 1, 13)>

There are a total of [5] 3-stars in the given graph.
