Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 27) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 23) (3, 29) (17, 29) (17, 18) (17, 21) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 22) (0, 3) (0, 25) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 21) (11, 24) (11, 18) (28, 27) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 19) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 21) (23, 3) (23, 25) (26, 10) (26, 8) (16, 12) (16, 8) (16, 18) (16, 6) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 22) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 20) (8, 26) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 27) (25, 29) (25, 0) (25, 23) (25, 8) (22, 29) (22, 10) (22, 20) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 16) (9, 1) (9, 14) (9, 24) (19, 12) (19, 20) (19, 6) (27, 1) (27, 28) (27, 8) (6, 0) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 15) (15, 6) (15, 13) (20, 24) (20, 22) (20, 19) (20, 5) (13, 1) (13, 15) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 20) (21, 17) (21, 14) (21, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Starting from the center node 1:
<1, (13, 9, 27)>
<1, (7, 13, 9)>
<1, (13, 15, 9)>
<1, (9, 14, 24)>

2. Moving on to the center node 3:
<3, (0, 29, 23)>
<3, (29, 17, 25)>
<3, (0, 25, 5)>

3. Lastly, exploring the center node 16:
<16, (6, 19, 8)>
<16, (6, 18, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
