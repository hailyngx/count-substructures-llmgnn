Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's analyze the connections of each node:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 9, 5, 3, 1
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 4, 8, 2, 0
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 6, 9, 1, 3
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 5, 2, 0
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 9, 7, 8, 1
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 6, 0, 3
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 9, 5, 2
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 4, 3, 8
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 9, 4, 7, 1
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, 0

Let's identify the 3-stars:
- From node 0: <0, (9, 5, 3)>
- From node 1: <1, (4, 8, 2)>
- From node 2: <2, (6, 9, 1)>
- From node 3: <3, (9, 7, 5)>
- From node 4: <4, (9, 7, 8)>
- From node 5: <5, (6, 0, 3)>
- From node 6: <6, (9, 5, 2)>
- From node 7: <7, (4, 3, 8)>
- From node 8: <8, (9, 4, 7)>
- From node 9: <9, (6, 8, 4)>, <9, (3, 7, 5)>

Therefore, there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
