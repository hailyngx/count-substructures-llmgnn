Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 9) (4, 27) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 22) (7, 17) (1, 19) (3, 20) (3, 26) (3, 22) (20, 3) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 14) (6, 28) (6, 24) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 10) (9, 27) (10, 9) (10, 27) (17, 7) (17, 29) (17, 2) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 15) (29, 9) (29, 17) (29, 5) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 2) (28, 23) (26, 3) (26, 28) (26, 27) (27, 4) (27, 9) (27, 10) (27, 26) (5, 29) (5, 24) (19, 1) (19, 20) (19, 15) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 18) (0, 16) (0, 23) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 18) (24, 21) (14, 11) (14, 25) (15, 4) (15, 12) (15, 19) (2, 17) (2, 28) (2, 13) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 18) (22, 7) (22, 3) (18, 12) (18, 8) (18, 24) (18, 13) (18, 21) (21, 8) (21, 24) (21, 18) (21, 23) (23, 28) (23, 0) (23, 21) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them and treating them as potential central nodes. 

Let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 11 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 16 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 4 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 7 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 20 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 25 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 6 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 9 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 10 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 17 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 12 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 29 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 28 has 5 edges connected. 
- Node 26 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 27 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 5 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 19 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 8 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 0 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 24 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 14 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 15 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 2 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 13 has 3 edges connected.
- Node 22 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 18 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 21 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 23 has 3 edges connected.

Based on the counts above, the nodes that can act as the center of a 3-star graph are: 7, 25, 17, 12, 29, 26, 5, 19, 8, 0, 14, 15, 2, 13, 22, and 23. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<7, (12, 22, 17)>
<25, (20, 14, 19)>
<29, (9, 17, 5)>
<26, (3, 27, 28)>
<5, (29, 24, 6)>
<19, (1, 15, 20)>
<8, (28, 18, 21)>
<0, (16, 23, 0)>
<14, (11, 25, 14)>
<15, (4, 12, 19)>
<2, (17, 28, 13)>
<13, (11, 18, 2)>
<22, (7, 3, 22)>
<23, (28, 0, 21)>
