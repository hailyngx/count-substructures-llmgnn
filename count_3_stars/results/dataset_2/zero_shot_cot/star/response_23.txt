Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 21) (2, 4) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 10) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 10) (12, 27) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 6) (27, 29) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 20) (27, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (22, 0) (26, 5) (26, 3) (24, 12) (24, 15) (6, 12) (6, 7) (6, 3) (21, 2) (21, 27) (21, 23) (21, 14) (28, 18) (28, 23) (5, 12) (5, 26) (5, 11) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 11) (0, 19) (15, 24) (19, 29) (19, 0) (19, 25) (23, 4) (23, 21) (23, 28) (3, 8) (3, 26) (3, 6) (3, 14) (14, 21) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 16) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 20) (1, 9) (20, 27) (20, 1) (20, 9) (20, 11) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 18) (25, 19) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 0) (11, 20) (16, 8) (16, 14) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 20) (18, 17) (18, 28) (18, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming the 3-star configurations. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can find the following 3-star configurations: 
<4, (2, 8, 23)>
<10, (13, 17, 29)>
<12, (6, 24, 27)>
<21, (2, 23, 27)>
<27, (12, 20, 29)>
<3, (8, 14, 26)>
<1, (9, 13, 20)>
<0, (11, 17, 19)>
<5, (11, 12, 26)>

Counting these unique 3-star configurations, we have found a total of [9] 3-stars.
