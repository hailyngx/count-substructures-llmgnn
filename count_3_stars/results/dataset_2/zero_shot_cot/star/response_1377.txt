Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 6) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 25) (15, 14) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 29) (17, 5) (7, 25) (12, 9) (12, 28) (12, 21) (0, 14) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 6) (22, 20) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 28) (20, 22) (20, 11) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 27) (25, 2) (6, 26) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 24) (21, 12) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (23, 10) (23, 29) (8, 0) (8, 19) (27, 25) (27, 21) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 26) (5, 17) (5, 4) (24, 6) (24, 18) (11, 1) (11, 20) (11, 19) (11, 4) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 13) (2, 0) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 13) (13, 28) (13, 2) (13, 4) (29, 26) (29, 10) (29, 23) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 24) (4, 21) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's determine the 3-star configurations:

1. <0, (8, 19, 28)>
2. <0, (2, 13, 28)>
3. <1, (11, 19, 28)>
4. <2, (0, 13, 25)>
5. <3, (6, 14, 15)>
6. <4, (5, 11, 13)>
7. <5, (4, 17, 26)>
8. <6, (3, 14, 26)>
9. <6, (21, 24, 27)>
10. <8, (0, 19, 28)>
11. <11, (1, 19, 20)>
12. <13, (2, 4, 28)>
13. <14, (0, 3, 6)>
14. <15, (3, 14, 25)>
15. <18, (10, 16, 24)>
16. <19, (8, 11, 2)>
17. <21, (4, 6, 12)>
18. <24, (6, 18, 27)>
19. <25, (2, 7, 15)>
20. <26, (5, 6, 29)>
21. <28, (0, 13, 19)>
22. <29, (10, 23, 26)>

Counting the unique 3-star configurations, we find there are [22] 3-stars in the given graph.
