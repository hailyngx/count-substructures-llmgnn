Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (14, 12) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 10) 

Response:
The center node of a 3-star must have degree 3. By examining the given edges, we can determine which nodes meet this condition. 

Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 5
- Node 12
- Node 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. We will consider all possible combinations of valid 3-stars based on the center nodes found above.

1. 3-star with 5 as the center:
<5, (2, 1, 4)>
<5, (13, 9, 1)>
<5, (2, 4, 1)>

2. 3-star with 12 as the center:
<12, (7, 14, 0)>
<12, (3, 6, 0)>

3. 3-star with 0 as the center:
<0, (11, 13, 3)>
<0, (12, 6, 3)>

Thus, there are a total of [7] 3-stars in the given graph.
