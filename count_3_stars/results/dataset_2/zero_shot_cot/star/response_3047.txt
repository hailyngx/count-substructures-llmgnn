Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 12) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 10) (0, 8) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 6) (19, 3) (19, 8) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 7) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 16) (6, 13) (6, 7) (6, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (12, 15) (12, 18) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 16) (4, 14) (4, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for each node that has exactly three neighbors connected to it. Let's analyze the graph step by step:

1. Node 0 has neighbors: 3, 15, 10, 8. It does not form a 3-star.
2. Node 1 does not have any neighbors.
3. Node 2 has neighbors: 8, 5. It does not form a 3-star.
4. Node 3 has neighbors: 15, 0, 14, 19, 5. It forms a 3-star: <3, (15, 0, 14)>.
5. Node 4 has neighbors: 14, 6. It does not form a 3-star.
6. Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 15, 2, 18, 7. It does not form a 3-star.
7. Node 6 has neighbors: 13, 7, 4. It does not form a 3-star.
8. Node 7 has neighbors: 8, 5, 6. It does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 8 has neighbors: 17, 2, 18, 0, 7. It forms a 3-star: <8, (17, 18, 0)>.
10. Node 9 has neighbors: 10, 14, 16. It does not form a 3-star.
11. Node 10 has neighbors: 11, 0, 9. It does not form a 3-star.
12. Node 11 has neighbors: 10, 13. It does not form a 3-star.
13. Node 12 has neighbors: 15, 18. It does not form a 3-star.
14. Node 13 has neighbors: 11, 17, 6. It does not form a 3-star.
15. Node 14 has neighbors: 3, 9, 4, 16. It does not form a 3-star.
16. Node 15 has neighbors: 3, 0, 12, 5. It does not form a 3-star.
17. Node 16 has neighbors: 14, 9. It does not form a 3-star.
18. Node 17 has neighbors: 13, 8, 18. It does not form a 3-star.
19. Node 18 has neighbors: 17, 2, 5, 12. It does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <3, (15, 0, 14)> and <8, (17, 18, 0)>. 
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
