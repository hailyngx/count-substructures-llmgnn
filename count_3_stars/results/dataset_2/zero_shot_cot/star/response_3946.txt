Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 25) (21, 15) (21, 1) (21, 14) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 20) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (12, 7) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 6) (28, 3) (28, 2) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 3) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 26) (14, 23) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 20) (18, 3) (18, 26) (25, 1) (25, 9) (25, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 9) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 22) (8, 0) (8, 9) (19, 22) (19, 6) (22, 17) (22, 19) (9, 25) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 23) (10, 15) (10, 28) (10, 6) (11, 15) (24, 27) (24, 5) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 23) (23, 14) (23, 9) (23, 5) (23, 16) (20, 4) (20, 26) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 23) (6, 2) (6, 27) (6, 19) (6, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find each occurrence of a 3-star pattern, which consists of a central node connected to three leaves.

Let's start by going through the given edges to identify the 3-stars:

1. Look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
2. For each such node, check if it forms a 3-star pattern by examining its neighbors.

Here are the identified 3-stars with their central nodes and leaf nodes:
<3, (15, 28, 17)>
<15, (3, 10, 21)>
<21, (1, 15, 14)>
<14, (3, 21, 0)>
<4, (13, 16, 20)>
<7, (12, 0, 13)>
<2, (6, 28, 0)>
<12, (7, 27, 6)>
<27, (12, 24, 6)>
<28, (3, 2, 10)>
<0, (7, 14, 8)>
<26, (1, 14, 18)>
<18, (3, 26, 0)>
<25, (1, 9, 5)>
<13, (4, 7, 9)>
<17, (3, 13, 22)>
<8, (0, 9, 8)>
<19, (22, 6, 5)>
<22, (17, 19, 9)>
<9, (25, 13, 8)>
<10, (15, 28, 6)>
<11, (15, 16, 3)>
<5, (25, 24, 23)>
<23, (14, 9, 5)>
<20, (4, 26, 16)>
<16, (15, 4, 13)>
<6, (2, 27, 19)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find 28 unique 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [28].
