Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 17) (7, 8) (18, 22) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 24) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 23) (27, 25) (27, 9) (27, 1) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 1) (20, 13) (20, 6) (26, 22) (26, 8) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 17) (17, 7) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 19) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 28) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (25, 27) (25, 8) (16, 0) (28, 3) (28, 13) (28, 10) (9, 27) (9, 15) (9, 21) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 2) (5, 21) (5, 14) (29, 7) (29, 24) (29, 21) (23, 12) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 21) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 5) (21, 29) (21, 13) (8, 7) (8, 26) (8, 25) (8, 6) (14, 5) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 9) (19, 17) (19, 10) (6, 0) (6, 20) (6, 8) (10, 28) (10, 19) (24, 22) (24, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star in the given graph.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, and 11.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 29, and 17.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 22, 15, and 12.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 18, 26, and 24.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 20, 16, and 15.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 20, and 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 17, 11, and 28.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 2.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 25, 9, and 1.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 0, 17, and 1.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 18, 9, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7, 26, and 25.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 21, and 14.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 7, 24, and 21.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 20, 28, and 21.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <4, (7, 12, 11)>
- <7, (4, 29, 17)>
- <18, (22, 15, 12)>
- <22, (18, 26, 24)>
- <0, (20, 16, 15)>
- <17, (7, 20, 1)>
- <3, (17, 11, 28)>
- <11, (4, 3, 2)>
- <27, (25, 9, 1)>
- <20, (0, 17, 1)>
- <21, (18, 9, 5)>
- <8, (7, 26, 25)>
- <5, (2, 21, 14)>
- <29, (7, 24, 21)>
- <13, (20, 28, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].
