Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 3) (26, 16) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 10) (18, 15) (22, 18) (22, 5) (22, 25) (0, 20) (0, 19) (0, 6) (20, 0) (20, 4) (20, 28) (17, 29) (17, 13) (29, 17) (29, 1) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 28) (8, 7) (28, 20) (28, 8) (28, 15) (1, 29) (1, 24) (1, 27) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 19) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 27) (2, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 25) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 6) (15, 18) (15, 28) (15, 14) (15, 12) (23, 25) (23, 16) (21, 27) (21, 12) (27, 1) (27, 7) (27, 21) (27, 11) (25, 22) (25, 13) (25, 14) (25, 23) (25, 16) (24, 1) (24, 7) (10, 18) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 27) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 20) (4, 11) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 25) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the nodes that form 3-star structures.

Looking at the edges provided, we can see that the nodes with degree 3 are: 5, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28.

Now, let's find the 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 5: <5, (8, 13, 22)>
- Node 8: <8, (5, 7, 28)>
- Node 13: <13, (5, 17, 25)>
- Node 15: <15, (14, 18, 12)>
- Node 16: <16, (26, 23, 25)>
- Node 18: <18, (22, 10, 14)>
- Node 20: <20, (0, 4, 28)>
- Node 22: <22, (18, 25, 5)>
- Node 25: <25, (13, 14, 16)>
- Node 28: <28, (20, 8, 15)>

Therefore, there are 9 unique 3-stars in the graph. 
So, the answer is [9].
