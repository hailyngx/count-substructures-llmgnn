Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 14) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 14) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars. 

Candidates: 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12

Now, for each of the candidates, we will check if they form a 3-star. A 3-star is formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes and those three nodes are not connected to each other. 

Let's go through each candidate:
- Candidate 1: <1, (3, 5, 13)>
- Candidate 3: <3, (1, 7, 12)>
- Candidate 4: <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- Candidate 7: <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- Candidate 9: <9, (1, 4, 14)>
- Candidate 10: No 3-star since all its neighbors are connected to each other.
- Candidate 11: No 3-star since all its neighbors are connected to each other.
- Candidate 12: <12, (2, 7, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
Unique 3-stars: <1, (3, 5, 13)>, <3, (1, 7, 12)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 14)>
