Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 16) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 6) (8, 17) (8, 6) (0, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 12) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (9, 13) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 13) (12, 1) (3, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 18) (13, 16) (13, 9) (13, 12) (18, 10) (18, 6) (18, 15) (18, 1) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars.

Step 1: Find nodes with degree 3 (potential centers of 3-stars)
- Node 4 has degree 5 (2, 7, 12, 15, 3)
- Node 14 has degree 4 (17, 11, 9, 19)
- Node 17 has degree 3 (14, 16, 8)
- Node 9 has degree 4 (14, 10, 19, 13)
- Node 18 has degree 4 (10, 6, 15, 1)
- Node 12 has degree 4 (4, 15, 13, 1)
- Node 1 has degree 3 (11, 12, 18)

Step 2: Identify 3-stars
- Let's consider each potential center identified in Step 1 and check if they are centers of 3-stars.

<14, (17, 11, 9)>
<4, (7, 12, 15)>
<9, (14, 10, 13)>
<12, (4, 15, 13)>
[4]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
