Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (12, 6) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify every node that acts as the center of a 3-star and the three nodes connected to it.

Let's list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 3)>
<5, (6, 13, 1)>
<4, (9, 11, 8)>
<13, (11, 8, 5)>
<11, (1, 13, 4)>
<8, (13, 4, 2)>
<1, (11, 5, 0)>
<2, (10, 8, 14)>
<0, (8, 14, 1)>
<14, (8, 5, 2)>
<7, (6, 14, 1)>
<3, (6, 9, 13)>
<10, (2, 11, 0)>
<12, (6, 14, 7)>

There are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
