Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 24) (26, 14) (26, 20) (26, 27) (3, 15) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 23) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 20) (7, 21) (7, 27) (21, 3) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 13) (0, 24) (0, 18) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 22) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 2) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 10) (4, 11) (4, 29) (4, 17) (22, 1) (22, 5) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 23) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 10) (29, 1) (29, 4) (29, 13) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 11) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 17) (23, 15) (23, 12) (23, 16) (10, 6) (10, 21) (10, 28) (10, 16) (13, 21) (13, 28) (13, 29) (13, 2) (13, 25) (20, 26) (20, 6) (20, 1) (25, 13) (24, 9) (24, 0) (18, 0) (18, 12) (18, 27) (27, 26) (27, 7) (27, 18) (17, 19) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes with three edges, which might be potential centers of 3-stars. Nodes with three edges are nodes 3, 6, 15, 21, 28, and 7. Now, we will check each of these nodes to see if they have exactly three edges connecting to new nodes. 

1. Node 3: (3, 15), (3, 21), (3, 28) -- Represents a 3-star <3, (15, 21, 28)>
2. Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 14), (6, 10) -- Represents a 3-star <6, (3, 14, 10)>
3. Node 15: (15, 3), (15, 1), (15, 23) -- Represents a 3-star <15, (3, 1, 23)>
4. Node 21: (21, 3), (21, 7), (21, 10) -- Represents a 3-star <21, (3, 7, 10)>
5. Node 28: (28, 3), (28, 8), (28, 13) -- Represents a 3-star <28, (3, 8, 13)>
6. Node 7: (7, 21), (7, 27), (7, 27) -- Represents a 3-star <7, (21, 27, 27)>

So we have found 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
