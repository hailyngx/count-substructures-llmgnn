Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Let's first check which nodes are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star.

Node 5 is connected with 4 other nodes (9, 6, 8, 7), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Node 9 is connected with 4 other nodes (5, 4, 3, 7), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Node 4 is connected with 6 other nodes (9, 7, 8, 1, 3, 2), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Node 7 is connected with 5 other nodes (5, 9, 4, 6, 7), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Node 1 is connected with 3 other nodes (4, 3, 6), satisfying the conditions of a 3-star. Let's find the leaves.

1. <1, (4, 3, 6)>

Node 3 is connected with 4 other nodes (9, 4, 1, 2), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Node 2 is connected with 4 other nodes (4, 3, 6, 0), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Node 8 is connected with 3 other nodes (5, 4, 6), satisfying the conditions of a 3-star. Let's find the leaves.

2. <8, (5, 4, 6)>

Node 6 is connected with 6 other nodes (5, 7, 1, 8, 2, 0), so it cannot be the center of a 3-star.

Node 0 is connected with 2 other nodes (6, 2), which is not enough to form a 3-star.

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are <1, (4, 3, 6)> and <8, (5, 4, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
