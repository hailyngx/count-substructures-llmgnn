Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. Count the degree of each node:
   - Node 0: degree = 2
   - Node 1: degree = 5
   - Node 2: degree = 5
   - Node 3: degree = 5
   - Node 4: degree = 5
   - Node 5: degree = 4
   - Node 6: degree = 3
   - Node 7: degree = 3
   - Node 8: degree = 4
   - Node 9: degree = 4
   - Node 10: degree = 4
   - Node 11: degree = 3
   - Node 12: degree = 5
   - Node 13: degree = 4
   - Node 14: degree = 5

2. Identify the 3-stars:
   - The 3-star patterns in this graph are: <5, (8, 1, 10)>, <4, (6, 13, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
