Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 11) (3, 6) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 10) (7, 8) (7, 19) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 9) (4, 18) (4, 2) (4, 15) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 18) (2, 4) (2, 6) (5, 14) (5, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 6) (19, 17) (19, 1) (19, 7) (19, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (9, 16) (9, 15) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 16) (6, 19) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. For node 1: (1, 10, 11), (1, 13, 8), (1, 19, 7), (1, 9, 12) -> <1, (10, 11, 13)>
2. For node 2: No 3-stars as it has only 2 connections.
3. For node 3: (3, 11, 8), (3, 6, 16) -> <3, (11, 8, 6)>
4. For node 4: (4, 18, 0), (4, 15, 12) -> <4, (18, 0, 15)>
5. For node 5: (5, 12, 9) -> <5, (12, 9, -)>
6. For node 6: (6, 19, 3) -> <6, (19, 3, -)>
7. For node 7: No 3-stars as it has only 2 connections.
8. For node 8: (8, 11, 3), (8, 13, 1), (8, 18, 4), (8, 7, 19) -> <8, (11, 3, 18)>
9. For node 9: (9, 1, 12), (9, 12, 5), (9, 16, 6), (9, 15, 4) -> <9, (1, 12, 16)>
10. For node 10: (10, 1, 11), (10, 16, 9) -> <10, (1, 11, 16)>
11. For node 11: (11, 3, 8), (11, 10, 1) -> <11, (3, 8, 10)>
12. For node 12: (12, 9, 5), (12, 15, 4) -> <12, (9, 5, 15)>
13. For node 13: (13, 1, 8) -> <13, (1, 8, -)>
14. For node 14: (14, 17, 18), (14, 5, 12) -> <14, (17, 18, 5)>
15. For node 15: (15, 12, 4) -> <15, (12, 4, -)>
16. For node 16: (16, 10, 9), (16, 6, 19) -> <16, (10, 9, 6)>
17. For node 17: (17, 14, 18), (17, 19, 7), (17, 8, 11) -> <17, (14, 18, 8)>
18. For node 18: (18, 14, 8), (18, 4, 0) -> <18, (14, 8, 4)>
19. For node 19: (19, 17, 7), (19, 1, 6) -> <19, (17, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].
