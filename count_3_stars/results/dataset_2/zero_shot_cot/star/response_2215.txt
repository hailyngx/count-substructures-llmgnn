Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 16) (9, 19) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 18) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 18) (10, 19) (17, 8) (17, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 11) (18, 16) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 12) (12, 2) (12, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 15) (7, 3) (7, 6) (15, 5) (15, 2) (15, 16) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 10) (19, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 19) 

Response:
Let's find all the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (9, 2, 15)>
2. <9, (5, 14, 16)>
3. <1, (11, 14, 19)>
4. <3, (7, 19, 18)>
5. <8, (4, 17, 0)>
6. <13, (11, 18, 4)>
7. <10, (19, 0, 16)>
8. <17, (8, 4, 2)>
9. <2, (5, 12, 15)>
10. <18, (3, 13, 16)>
11. <6, (5, 7, 0)>
12. <4, (8, 17, 12)>
13. <12, (2, 4, 17)>
14. <11, (1, 13, 14)>
15. <14, (9, 1, 11)>
16. <16, (9, 18, 15)>
17. <7, (3, 6, 19)>
18. <15, (5, 2, 16)>
19. <19, (9, 3, 10)>
20. <0, (8, 6, 19)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [20].
