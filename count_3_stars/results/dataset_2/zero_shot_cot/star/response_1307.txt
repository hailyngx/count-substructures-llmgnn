Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 0) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's analyze the given graph to count the number of 3-stars.

First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 9, 17, 19, 12
- Node 1: 16, 14
- Node 2: 7, 18, 14
- Node 3: 11, 7, 12
- Node 4: 7
- Node 5: 16, 8, 12
- Node 6: 16, 9, 19
- Node 7: 3, 4, 2
- Node 8: 11, 5
- Node 9: 16, 6, 18, 0
- Node 10: 17, 12
- Node 11: 3, 15, 8
- Node 12: 3, 10, 5, 0
- Node 13: 15, 14
- Node 14: 15, 2, 19, 1, 13
- Node 15: 11, 15, 13, 14
- Node 16: 1, 9, 5, 6
- Node 17: 10, 0
- Node 18: 15, 9, 2
- Node 19: 6, 14, 0

Now, we will count the number of unique 3-stars:
<0, (9, 17, 19)>
<1, (16, 14, 15)>
<2, (7, 18, 14)>
<3, (11, 7, 12)>
<5, (16, 8, 12)>
<6, (16, 9, 19)>
<9, (16, 6, 18)>
<12, (10, 5, 0)>
<14, (15, 19, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
