Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 11) (0, 16) (0, 12) (14, 4) (14, 6) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 19) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 12) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (12, 0) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) (17, 12) (17, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 17) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these identified nodes, check if they are connected to each other. If so, they form a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<3, (7, 9, 15)>
<7, (3, 15, 19)>
<9, (3, 8, 11)>
<15, (1, 5, 7)>
<16, (0, 12, 2)>
<12, (0, 15, 13)>
<11, (6, 9, 13)>
<2, (9, 16, 17)>

Counting these 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
