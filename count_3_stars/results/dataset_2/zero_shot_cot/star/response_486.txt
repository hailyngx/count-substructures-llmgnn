Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes connected to node 5 to see if there are any 3-stars involving node 5 as the center. We have the following edges connected to node 5: (5, 9), (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1). 

Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 5 as the center are:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 1)>

Next, let's identify the nodes connected to node 9 to see if there are any 3-stars involving node 9 as the center. We have the following edges connected to node 9: (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 0).

Therefore, the 3-stars involving node 9 as the center are:
<9, (5, 8, 3)>
<9, (5, 8, 0)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we have found 4 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
