Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we'll look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Starting with node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 4, 6, and 7. Since it is not connected to exactly three nodes, it is not a part of any 3-star.

Moving on to other nodes: 
- Node 1 is a part of the following 3-stars: <1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (6, 4, 2)>.
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to only two nodes.
- Node 3 is not part of any 3-star since it is connected to only three nodes and not exactly three.
- Node 4 is a part of the following 3-stars: <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 0, 3)>.
- Node 5 doesn't have exactly three connections, so it is not the center of any 3-star.
- Node 6 is a part of the following 3-star: <6, (5, 8, 1)>.
- Node 7 doesn't have exactly three connections, so it is not the center of any 3-star.
- Node 8 is a part of the following 3-star: <8, (5, 4, 6)>.
- Node 9 is a part of the following 3-star: <9, (5, 4, 3)>.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<1, (5, 9, 8)>, <1, (6, 4, 2)>, <4, (5, 8, 2)>, <4, (9, 0, 3)>, <6, (5, 8, 1)>, <8, (5, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 4, 3)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
