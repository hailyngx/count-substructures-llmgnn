Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars by looking at nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (9, 6, 0)>
<9, (5, 8, 1)>
<4, (3, 7, 6)>
<7, (5, 9, 11)>
<1, (9, 3, 10)>
<3, (4, 1, 13)>
<8, (9, 13, 6)>
<13, (3, 8, 10)>
<10, (5, 1, 13)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (11, 14, 0)>
<0, (5, 13, 6)>
<14, (1, 11, 2)>
<12, (3, 0, 14)>

Now we count the number of unique 3-stars:
