Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern.

Let's go step by step:
1. Identify all nodes that have exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of 3-stars.
2. For each potential center node, check if the nodes connected to it share no other connections among themselves. If they do not share any other connections, then we have found a 3-star.

Let's go ahead and find the 3-stars in the given graph:

The potential center nodes with exactly 3 connected edges: 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, 6, 2, 0, 1, 3.

List of 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 6, 3)>
<7, (9, 0, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 2)>
<6, (4, 2, 0)>
<2, (5, 8, 6)>
<0, (7, 6, 1)>
<1, (5, 8, 0)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
