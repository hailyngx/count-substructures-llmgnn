Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 22) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 1) (2, 12) (2, 21) (2, 11) (2, 0) (29, 7) (29, 27) (29, 3) (6, 10) (6, 23) (28, 21) (28, 16) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 8) (21, 15) (4, 12) (18, 17) (18, 3) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 27) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 8) (17, 18) (17, 16) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 27) (16, 28) (16, 13) (16, 17) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (15, 21) (15, 14) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 23) (23, 6) (23, 11) (23, 12) (8, 21) (8, 26) (8, 20) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 7) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 23) (7, 29) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 25) (7, 14) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 22) (0, 2) (10, 6) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 22) (22, 5) (22, 25) (22, 14) (22, 24) (3, 29) (3, 18) (3, 24) (24, 9) (24, 22) (24, 3) (27, 29) (27, 13) (27, 20) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to a central node by exactly three edges, which are the leaves of a 3-star.

1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 22, and 11.
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 24, and 1.
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 12, 21, and 11.
4. Node 21 is connected to nodes 2, 28, and 12.
5. Node 26 is connected to nodes 13, 25, and 8.
6. Node 16 is connected to nodes 28, 13, and 17.
7. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 8.
8. Node 23 is connected to nodes 6, 11, and 12.
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 21, 26, and 20.
10. Node 7 is connected to nodes 29, 1, and 19.
11. Node 22 is connected to nodes 5, 25, and 14.
12. Node 3 is connected to nodes 29, 18, and 24.
13. Node 27 is connected to nodes 29, 13, and 20.

There are no more nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Therefore, the 3-stars in the given graph are:
<5, (9, 22, 11)>
<9, (5, 24, 1)>
<2, (12, 21, 11)>
<21, (2, 28, 12)>
<26, (13, 25, 8)>
<16, (28, 13, 17)>
<1, (9, 11, 8)>
<23, (6, 11, 12)>
<8, (21, 26, 20)>
<7, (29, 1, 19)>
<22, (5, 25, 14)>
<3, (29, 18, 24)>
<27, (29, 13, 20)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].
