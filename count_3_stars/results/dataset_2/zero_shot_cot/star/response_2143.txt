Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (22, 23) (22, 4) (22, 3) (23, 22) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 20) (4, 17) (4, 26) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 29) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 11) (26, 0) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 13) (17, 4) (17, 2) (20, 4) (20, 1) (20, 14) (20, 24) (3, 22) (3, 21) (21, 3) (21, 24) (7, 9) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 11) (6, 10) (6, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 28) (11, 26) (11, 25) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 24) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 10) (24, 5) (24, 20) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 13) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 19) (0, 26) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 12) (29, 18) (29, 16) (29, 13) (29, 12) (13, 28) (13, 24) (13, 29) (19, 9) (19, 25) (19, 2) (19, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 16) (16, 18) (16, 29) (16, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars. Then, we will check if there are edges between the neighbors of these potential centers to confirm the presence of 3-stars.

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5
- Node 4
- Node 26
- Node 14
- Node 24
- Node 3
- Node 21
- Node 20
- Node 17
- Node 29
- Node 13
- Node 12

Let's now count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 5: (5, 2, 17), (5, 8, 28), (5, 14, 20), (5, 24, 21)
- Node 4: (4, 17, 2), (4, 20, 14), (4, 22, 3), (4, 18, 29), (4, 26, 11)
- Node 26: (26, 4, 22), (26, 28, 13)
- Node 14: (14, 5, 20), (14, 11, 24), (14, 12, 1), (14, 10, 6)
- Node 24: (24, 11, 14), (24, 5, 20), (24, 21, 3), (24, 13, 29)
- Node 3: (3, 22, 4), (3, 21, 24)
- Node 21: (21, 24, 3)
- Node 20: (20, 4, 17), (20, 14, 5), (20, 24, 1)
- Node 17: (17, 4, 2)
- Node 29: (29, 18, 4), (29, 13, 24), (29, 16, 10), (29, 12, 14)
- Node 13: (13, 28, 26), (13, 24, 29), (13, 29, 12)
- Node 12: (12, 14, 1), (12, 29, 13)
