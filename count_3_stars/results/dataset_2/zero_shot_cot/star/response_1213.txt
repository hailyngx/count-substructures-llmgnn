Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 20) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 22) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 14) (27, 13) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 24) (6, 9) (6, 22) (10, 26) (10, 19) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 26) (0, 19) (20, 11) (20, 0) (7, 25) (12, 16) (12, 21) (12, 18) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 13) (24, 28) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 0) (26, 24) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 17) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 25) (17, 28) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 21) (2, 4) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 17) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 21) (23, 21) (23, 29) (29, 15) (29, 23) (8, 0) (8, 24) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 4) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 18) (21, 23) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 13) (22, 11) (22, 16) (22, 6) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 2) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and its connected leaves for each potential 3-star.

Let's go step-by-step:
1. Identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 5 has 4 connections: 9, 19, 2, and 1.
   - Node 9 has 3 connections: 5, 6, and 24.
   - Node 12 has 3 connections: 16, 21, and 18.
   - Node 15 has 4 connections: 26, 25, 29, and 1.
   - Node 17 has 4 connections: 16, 19, 25, and 28.
   - Node 20 has 4 connections: 11, 0, 26, and 28.
   - Node 22 has 3 connections: 11, 16, and 6.
   - Node 24 has 5 connections: 9, 26, 8, 13, and 28.
   - Node 25 has 4 connections: 15, 7, 17, and 1.
   - Node 26 has 4 connections: 15, 10, 0, and 24.

2. For each node identified above, check if it forms a 3-star:
   - Node 5: <5, (9, 19, 2)> and <5, (9, 19, 1)>
   - Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 24)>
   - Node 12: <12, (16, 21, 18)>
   - Node 15: <15, (26, 25, 29)> and <15, (26, 25, 1)>
   - Node 17: <17, (16, 19, 25)> and <17, (16, 19, 28)>
   - Node 20: <20, (11, 0, 26)> and <20, (11, 0, 28)>
   - Node 22: <22, (11, 16, 6)>
   - Node 24: <24, (9, 26, 8)>, <24, (9, 26, 13)>, and <24, (9, 26, 28)>
   - Node 25: <25, (15, 26, 29)> and <25, (15, 26, 1)>
   - Node 26: <26, (15, 10, 0)> and <26, (15, 10, 24)>

Count of 3-stars: [16]
Unique 3-stars: 
<5, (9, 19, 2)>, <5, (9, 19, 1)>, <9, (5, 6, 24)>, <12, (16, 21, 18)>, <15, (26, 25, 29)>, <15, (26, 25, 1)>, <17, (16, 19, 25)>, <17, (16, 19, 28)>, <20, (11, 0, 26)>, <20, (11, 0, 28)>, <22, (11, 16, 6)>, <24, (9, 26, 8)>, <24, (9, 26, 13)>, <24, (9, 26, 28)>, <25, (15, 26, 29)>, <26, (15, 10, 0)>, <26, (15, 10, 24)>
