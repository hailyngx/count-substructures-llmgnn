Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-star structures in the graph:

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 6, 1)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 8, 2)>
3. Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (8, 0, 1)>
4. Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (9, 4, 7)>
5. Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 4, 7)>
6. Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (5, 7)>
7. Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (9, 4, 3)>
8. Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (5, 8, 6)>
9. Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 4)>
10. Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (9, 4, 2)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
