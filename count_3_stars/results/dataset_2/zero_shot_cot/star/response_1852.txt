Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 20) (16, 11) (16, 8) (9, 29) (9, 21) (9, 17) (9, 1) (26, 6) (20, 11) (20, 25) (20, 13) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 22) (15, 23) (15, 0) (15, 24) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 9) (29, 28) (29, 22) (29, 18) (29, 10) (22, 25) (22, 29) (22, 8) (3, 23) (21, 9) (21, 13) (27, 25) (27, 5) (0, 15) (0, 10) (0, 17) (10, 29) (10, 0) (10, 18) (2, 12) (12, 25) (12, 2) (12, 5) (24, 11) (24, 15) (24, 28) (6, 26) (6, 23) (5, 27) (5, 12) (5, 17) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 8) (17, 9) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 19) (13, 20) (13, 21) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 14) (7, 8) (14, 13) (14, 23) (23, 15) (23, 3) (23, 6) (23, 13) (23, 14) (4, 13) (4, 19) (19, 20) (19, 17) (19, 4) (18, 11) (18, 29) (18, 10) (8, 16) (8, 25) (8, 22) (8, 1) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential central nodes for the 3-stars.

The nodes with three edges connected to them are:
- Node 11
- Node 16
- Node 9
- Node 26
- Node 20
- Node 25
- Node 15
- Node 28
- Node 22
- Node 3
- Node 21
- Node 27
- Node 0
- Node 10
- Node 2
- Node 6
- Node 1
- Node 5
- Node 13
- Node 7
- Node 14
- Node 4
- Node 19
- Node 18
- Node 8

Next, let's check each of these nodes and their connected nodes to see if they form 3-stars. 

After checking, we find the following 3-stars in the graph:
<3, (23, 6, 14)>
<9, (29, 21, 17)>
<10, (29, 0, 18)>
<13, (20, 21, 4)>
<16, (11, 8, 7)>
<18, (11, 29, 10)>
<19, (20, 17, 4)>
<21, (9, 13, 1)>
<22, (25, 29, 8)>
<29, (9, 28, 22)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
