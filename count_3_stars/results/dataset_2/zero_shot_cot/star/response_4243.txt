Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

<[1, (2, 7, 0)]>
<[3, (8, 5, 0)]>
<[4, (6, 9, 5)]>
<[5, (3, 8, 4)]>
<[6, (4, 2, 7)]>
<[9, (8, 4, 6)]>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
