Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 27) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 5) (1, 23) (3, 1) (8, 4) (8, 25) (8, 17) (13, 26) (13, 24) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 21) (2, 16) (2, 0) (15, 20) (15, 29) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 21) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 10) (17, 8) (17, 15) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 15) (29, 17) (26, 13) (26, 14) (26, 5) (0, 2) (0, 14) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 26) (14, 0) (24, 6) (24, 13) (21, 12) (21, 15) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 18) (5, 22) (19, 6) (19, 9) (19, 22) (22, 5) (22, 19) (22, 27) (25, 9) (25, 8) (25, 23) (28, 27) (28, 10) (28, 23) (27, 11) (27, 20) (27, 22) (27, 28) (18, 17) (18, 5) (10, 16) (10, 20) (10, 28) (23, 1) (23, 25) (23, 28) 

Response:
The first step is to identify all nodes with exactly three edges. These nodes will serve as potential centers for 3-stars. The nodes with exactly three edges are: 0, 2, 3, and 7.

Next, we will check each potential center node and see if it forms a 3-star structure with its neighboring nodes.

For node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 14, but not to any other node with exactly three edges.

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 16, 10. This forms a 3-star structure with node 2 as the center. 
<2, (0, 16, 10)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 20, 5. This forms a 3-star structure with node 3 as the center. 
<3, (1, 20, 5)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 12, 20, 27. This forms a 3-star structure with node 7 as the center. 
<7, (12, 20, 27)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
