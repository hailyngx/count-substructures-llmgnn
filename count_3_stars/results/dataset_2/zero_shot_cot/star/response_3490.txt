Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5. These are nodes 1, 2, 3, and 9.
Now, let's check for each of these nodes if they form a 3-star with node 5:

1. Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 2), and (1, 0) - Does not form a 3-star with node 5.
2. Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 6), and (2, 1) - Forms a 3-star <2, (5, 6, 1)>.
3. Node 3: (3, 5), (3, 7), and (3, 0) - Does not form a 3-star with node 5.
4. Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 4), and (9, 0) - Does not form a 3-star with node 5.

So, there is 1 unique 3-star in the graph: <2, (5, 6, 1)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
