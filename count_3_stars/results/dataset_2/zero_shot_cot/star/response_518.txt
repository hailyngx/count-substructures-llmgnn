Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

First, we'll find the central nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 9 has 8 edges
- Node 4 has 5 edges
- Node 7 has 6 edges
- Node 1 has 4 edges
- Node 3 has 4 edges
- Node 8 has 4 edges
- Node 2 has 4 edges
- Node 0 has 5 edges
- Node 6 has 2 edges

Next, we'll list the 3-stars:
<5, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (9, 7, 0)>
<8, (4, 9, 2)>
<2, (9, 4, 8)>
<0, (9, 7, 3)>
