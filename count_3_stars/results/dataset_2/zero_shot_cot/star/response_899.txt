Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each node that acts as a center in a 3-star. A 3-star consists of a center connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (7, 9, 0)>
<7, (4, 3, 8)>
<1, (3, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<8, (7, 9, 5)>
<5, (4, 1, 8)>
<6, (3, 8, 5)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (4, 1, 8)>
<2, (4, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
