Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-star configurations. Remember, a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<2, (8, 1, 0)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<0, (6, 4, 3)>
<7, (9, 8, 1)>
<1, (6, 2, 7)>
<3, (9, 0, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: 
[6]
