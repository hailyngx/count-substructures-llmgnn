Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 19) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 17) (29, 11) (29, 13) (29, 5) (7, 21) (7, 18) (7, 8) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 3) (21, 18) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 4) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 21) (18, 4) (28, 11) (28, 5) (28, 23) (3, 11) (3, 21) (3, 4) (3, 20) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 5) (20, 3) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 27) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 0) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 22) (19, 16) (19, 5) (19, 14) (0, 15) (0, 25) (10, 2) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 23) (14, 19) (26, 11) (26, 25) (25, 0) (25, 26) (27, 20) (27, 24) (27, 9) (6, 23) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 9) (23, 28) (23, 10) (23, 6) (23, 9) (9, 27) (9, 12) (9, 23) (22, 16) (22, 5) (22, 12) (24, 27) (24, 12) (13, 29) (13, 20) (13, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to node 11, as these are the potential leaves of any 3-stars involving node 11:

- Nodes directly connected to node 11: 16, 28, 3, 26, 29

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars involving node 11. These will have node 11 as the center and three other nodes as leaves:

- 3-star with center 11: <11, (16, 29, 28)> [1]
- 3-star with center 11: <11, (3, 21, 4)> [2]
- 3-star with center 11: <11, (26, 25, 0)> [3]
- 3-star with center 11: <11, (29, 13, 20)> [4]

Therefore, there are four unique 3-stars involving the center node 11, resulting in a total of [4] 3-stars in the given graph.
