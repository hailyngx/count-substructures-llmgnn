Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

We can first identify the nodes with 3 neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 5 has neighbors 9, 6, 2, 8, and 0.
- Node 9 has neighbors 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 6 has neighbors 5, 9, and 2.
- Node 4 has neighbors 7, 8, 0, and 1.
- Node 7 has neighbors 4, 3, 2, and 8.
- Node 1 has neighbors 4, 3, and 0.
- Node 3 has neighbors 7, 1, and 8.
- Node 8 has neighbors 5, 9, 4, 7, and 3.
- Node 0 has neighbors 5, 4, and 1.
- Node 2 has neighbors 5, 6, 4, 7, and 1.

From the nodes above, we see that nodes 5, 9, 6, 8, 3, and 2 have exactly three neighbors each. 

Next, we list all unique 3-stars <center, leaves>:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (5, 9, 2)>
<8, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (7, 1, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
