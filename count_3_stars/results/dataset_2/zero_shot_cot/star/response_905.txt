Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique instances of a central node connected to three other nodes.

Let's list out the 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (6, 3, 1)>
<1, (9, 3, 5)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (6, 1, 5)>
<5, (6, 1, 8)>
<0, (6, 3, 7)>
<2, (6, 9, 4)>
<7, (6, 0, 2)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph.
So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
