Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 29) (15, 17) (6, 14) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 10) (9, 7) (25, 19) (25, 8) (25, 18) (8, 25) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 27) (22, 3) (22, 9) (22, 28) (23, 26) (23, 16) (23, 20) (27, 13) (27, 18) (27, 14) (27, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 28) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 1) (24, 26) (24, 16) (24, 10) (24, 20) (26, 23) (26, 24) (26, 0) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 20) (28, 22) (28, 4) (28, 11) (28, 2) (18, 25) (18, 27) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 24) (16, 10) (21, 12) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 19) (29, 15) (29, 1) (14, 6) (14, 27) (20, 23) (20, 24) (20, 11) (20, 1) (2, 7) (2, 28) (2, 0) (19, 25) (19, 1) (17, 15) (17, 9) (0, 4) (0, 26) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 16) (5, 4) (5, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 8, 10, and 28
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 9, 12, and 27
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 7, 17, and 22
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 3, 17, and 29
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 8, 10, and 24
- Node 20: Connected to nodes 1, 11, and 23
- Node 23: Connected to nodes 16, 20, and 26
- Node 24: Connected to nodes 10, 16, and 26
- Node 25: Connected to nodes 8, 18, and 19
- Node 26: Connected to nodes 0, 23, and 24
- Node 27: Connected to nodes 7, 13, and 14
- Node 28: Connected to nodes 2, 4, and 22

2. Assemble the unique 3-stars:
- <4, (8, 10, 28)>
- <7, (9, 12, 27)>
- <9, (7, 17, 22)>
- <15, (3, 17, 29)>
- <16, (8, 10, 24)>
- <20, (1, 11, 23)>
- <23, (16, 20, 26)>
- <24, (10, 16, 26)>
- <25, (8, 18, 19)>
- <26, (0, 23, 24)>
- <27, (7, 13, 14)>
- <28, (2, 4, 22)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars:
