Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible combinations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes in a star pattern.

- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 4, and 8: <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 8: <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 2, and 7: <3, (1, 2, 7)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 3, and 7: <1, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 6, and 9: <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 4: <2, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 2, 5, and 6: <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 3, and 5: <7, (1, 3, 5)>

So, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
