Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 26) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 23) (16, 26) (15, 27) (15, 6) (15, 25) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 1) (20, 27) (20, 25) (20, 23) (25, 15) (25, 20) (25, 12) (25, 10) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 25) (12, 7) (12, 29) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 10) (1, 27) (1, 19) (26, 11) (26, 16) (26, 22) (21, 0) (28, 14) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 10) (22, 24) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 29) (19, 1) (19, 22) (23, 16) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 0) (2, 11) (2, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (14, 28) (14, 3) (14, 8) (24, 15) (24, 22) (24, 29) (0, 21) (0, 23) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 17) (9, 10) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 23) (29, 24) (10, 25) (10, 7) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 9) (6, 15) (6, 4) (6, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the potential 3-stars in the given graph. Since a 3-star has a center connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes with three edges that form a triangle.

Upon examining the provided edges, we can form the following list of potential 3-stars:

<11, (16, 13, 26)>
<16, (11, 23, 26)>
<15, (27, 6, 25)>
<27, (15, 20, 1)>
<12, (25, 7, 29)>
<18, (7, 4, 10)>
<1, (27, 19, NOT A 3-STAR)>
<26, (11, 16, 22)>
<22, (26, 19, 10)>
<3, (17, 14, 29)>
<2, (11, 5, NOT A 3-STAR)>
<14, (28, 3, 8)>
<24, (15, 22, 29)>
<0, (21, 23, 6)>
<9, (7, 17, 10)>
<29, (12, 3, 23)>

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. 

[The total number of 3-stars is 9, denoted as []]

The unique 3-stars are:
<11, (16, 13, 26)>
<16, (11, 23, 26)>
<15, (27, 6, 25)>
<27, (15, 20, 1)>
<12, (25, 7, 29)>
<18, (7, 4, 10)>
<26, (11, 16, 22)>
<22, (26, 19, 10)>
<3, (17, 14, 29)>
