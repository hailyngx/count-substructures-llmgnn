Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 6) (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 17) (18, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 2) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 6) (19, 7) (19, 14) (19, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (6, 16) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 12) (0, 19) (0, 10) (0, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 19) (9, 18) (9, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 17) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-star configurations. Since a 3-star has one central node and three leaves connected to it, we can look for nodes with exactly three incident edges.

Nodes with 3 incident edges: {2, 5, 6, 8, 15, 16}

Next, we identify the edges that form 3-stars:

<2, (11, 13, 3)>
<5, (11, 1, 4)>
<6, (8, 12, 16)>
<8, (6, 17, 10)>
<15, (16, 3, 6)>
<16, (11, 15, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
