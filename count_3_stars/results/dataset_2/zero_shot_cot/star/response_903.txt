Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all possible 3-stars.

1. Node 5: <5, (9, 4, 7)>
2. Node 9: <9, (5, 6, 4)>
3. Node 6: <6, (9, 7, 3)>
4. Node 4: <4, (5, 9, 7)>
5. Node 7: <7, (5, 9, 6)>
6. Node 2: No 3-star centered at node 2.
7. Node 8: No 3-star centered at node 8.
8. Node 0: No 3-star centered at node 0.
9. Node 1: No 3-star centered at node 1.
10. Node 3: <3, (6, 4, 2)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
