Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes with degree 3. These nodes will be the center nodes of the 3-stars.
Nodes with degree 3: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

Next, for each center node, we check the neighbors to determine the 3-stars. We will list the unique 3-stars found: 
<0, (9, 4, 8)>
<2, (6, 3, 7)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<8, (1, 3, 4)>
  
Counting the number of 3-stars found: 5
