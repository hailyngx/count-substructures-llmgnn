Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first list the 3-stars present in the graph:

<6, (5, 14, 12)>
<9, (10, 1, 7)>
<5, (6, 13, 2)>
<2, (5, 10, 3)>
<8, (10, 11, 7)>
<3, (2, 11, 4)>
<11, (2, 8, 3)>
<13, (6, 5, 10)>
<4, (3, 11, 0)>
<12, (6, 5, 8)>
<0, (6, 11, 4)>
<10, (9, 2, 13)>
<14, (6, 13, 1)>
<1, (9, 12, 14)>
<7, (9, 8, 14)>

By listing out the unique 3-stars, we can see that there are a total of <15> 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [<15>].
