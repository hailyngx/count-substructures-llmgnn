Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star can be formed when a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

From the given edges, we can find the following 3-stars:
<6, (9, 8, 0)>
<9, (6, 8, 4)>
<4, (9, 7, 5)>
<7, (4, 0, 3)>
<1, (3, 2, 5)>
<3, (4, 7, 1)>
<2, (9, 7, 1)>
<8, (6, 9, 1)>
<0, (6, 7, 3)>
<5, (4, 1, 8)>

Now, we can count the number of unique 3-stars: [10].
