Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 27) (25, 28) (25, 11) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 20) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 28) (13, 6) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 2) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 7) (20, 8) (20, 0) (20, 26) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 22) (12, 7) (12, 5) (14, 0) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 29) (18, 4) (18, 27) (18, 21) (18, 17) (26, 20) (28, 25) (28, 13) (10, 3) (10, 2) (15, 9) (15, 2) (15, 29) (15, 17) (11, 25) (11, 23) (11, 5) (11, 21) (16, 19) (19, 22) (19, 16) (27, 25) (27, 18) (27, 17) (1, 13) (29, 4) (29, 15) (5, 23) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 24) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 24) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 15) (2, 6) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 9) (17, 21) (24, 5) (24, 9) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 17) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify and count these 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Nodes with exactly three neighbors:
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 7, 10, 4, and 8 -> Forms 3-stars <3, (25, 7, 8)>, <3, (25, 10, 4)>, and <3, (7, 8, 4)>
   - Node 25 is connected to nodes 3, 27, 28, 11, and 8 -> Forms 3-stars <25, (3, 28, 11)>, <25, (27, 28, 11)>, and <25, (3, 27, 8)>
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 13, 20, 7, 1, and 20 -> Forms 3-stars <8, (3, 13, 20)> and <8, (3, 20, 7)>

2. Count of 3-stars found:
   - Total 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (25, 7, 8)>
<3, (25, 10, 4)>
<3, (7, 8, 4)>
<25, (3, 28, 11)>
<25, (27, 28, 11)>
