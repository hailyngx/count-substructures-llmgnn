Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 3) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 15) (18, 13) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 17) (8, 7) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 5) (0, 7) (0, 17) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 10) (13, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 8) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 16) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 19) (16, 1) (16, 17) (15, 6) (15, 9) (15, 18) (12, 6) (12, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 5) (19, 1) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
The 3-stars are:
<2, (6, 10, 11)>
<9, (6, 15, 3)>
<1, (11, 14, 16)>
<17, (1, 3, 0)>
<18, (4, 15, 10)>
Thus, the final answer is [5].
