Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's analyze the graph:

- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 8.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: [10]
