Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 5) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this network are: 
<8, (1, 7, 13)>
<13, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (2, 9, 14)>
<11, (2, 6, 9)>
<12, (5, 6, 10)>
<1, (7, 8, 13)>
<6, (7, 11, 12)>
<0, (9, 10, 13)>
<10, (0, 4, 12)>
<14, (5, 7, 14)>
<2, (3, 9, 11)>
<5, (7, 12, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
