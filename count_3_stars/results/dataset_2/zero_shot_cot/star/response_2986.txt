Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (9, 0, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 1)>
<1, (5, 4, 6)>
<3, (5, 4, 6)>
<8, (6, 2, 0)>
<2, (7, 8, 0)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars present in the graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
