Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 22) (16, 23) (16, 9) (13, 11) (13, 15) (22, 16) (22, 3) (12, 20) (12, 10) (12, 23) (27, 21) (27, 9) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 23) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 7) (28, 17) (28, 25) (29, 20) (29, 5) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 21) (15, 13) (15, 20) (15, 2) (20, 12) (20, 29) (20, 15) (20, 17) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 17) (17, 28) (17, 20) (17, 24) (3, 11) (3, 22) (3, 8) (5, 11) (5, 29) (5, 0) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 25) (19, 10) (7, 26) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 24) (6, 25) (6, 4) (21, 27) (21, 14) (21, 18) (8, 11) (8, 3) (18, 0) (18, 21) (18, 10) (18, 25) (23, 16) (23, 12) (23, 1) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 10) (4, 19) (4, 6) (9, 16) (9, 27) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (25, 28) (25, 19) (25, 6) (25, 18) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes in the given graph. The central nodes will have degree 3 since they are connected to exactly three other nodes.

The central nodes are: 11, 16, 12, 1, 26, 20, 17, 3, 5, 0, 15, 24, 6, 21, 18, and 10.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph. Here we list the unique 3-stars found:

<11, (16, 3, 13)>
<16, (11, 22, 23)>
<12, (20, 10, 23)>
<1, (26, 6, 23)>
<26, (1, 24, 7)>
<20, (12, 29, 15)>
<17, (28, 20, 24)>
<3, (11, 22, 8)>
<5, (11, 29, 0)>
<0, (7, 18, 5)>
<15, (13, 20, 2)>
<24, (26, 6, 17)>
<6, (1, 24, 4)>
<21, (27, 14, 18)>
<18, (0, 21, 10)>
<10, (19, 18, 2)>
