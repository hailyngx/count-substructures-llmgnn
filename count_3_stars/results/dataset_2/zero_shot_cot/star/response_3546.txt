Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 29) (7, 6) (7, 19) (21, 7) (21, 5) (21, 15) (20, 13) (20, 4) (25, 3) (25, 9) (25, 16) (25, 12) (3, 25) (3, 22) (3, 18) (12, 25) (12, 27) (12, 24) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 9) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 20) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 18) (1, 26) (1, 5) (1, 0) (26, 1) (26, 22) (26, 11) (22, 3) (22, 26) (22, 29) (11, 26) (4, 20) (4, 19) (6, 7) (6, 24) (6, 0) (24, 12) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 10) (15, 21) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 7) (19, 4) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 0) (5, 21) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 23) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 10) (29, 7) (29, 22) (29, 0) (9, 25) (9, 27) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 17) (17, 24) (17, 2) (17, 23) (17, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (10, 8) (10, 24) (10, 23) (14, 12) (14, 15) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 29) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star separately. Let's go step-by-step:

1. From the given edges, find all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes can potentially be the centers of the 3-stars. 
Based on the edges provided, the following nodes fit this criterion:
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 21, 29, and 6
- Node 21: Connected to nodes 7, 5, and 15
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 25, 27, and 24
- Node 26: Connected to nodes 1, 22, and 11

2. For each potential center node identified in the previous step, check if they form a 3-star.
Let's check each potential 3-star:
- 3-star with center node 7: <7, (21, 29, 6)>
- 3-star with center node 21: <21, (7, 5, 15)>
- 3-star with center node 12: <12, (25, 27, 24)>
- 3-star with center node 26: <26, (1, 22, 11)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [4]
Unique 3-stars found:
<7, (21, 29, 6)>
<21, (7, 5, 15)>
<12, (25, 27, 24)>
<26, (1, 22, 11)>
