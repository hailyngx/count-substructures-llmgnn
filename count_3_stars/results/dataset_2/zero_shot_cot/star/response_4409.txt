Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 15) (22, 13) (22, 19) (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 3) (26, 8) (0, 10) (27, 25) (27, 10) (27, 17) (27, 5) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 23) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 12) (21, 17) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 26) (8, 23) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 18) (23, 7) (23, 8) (23, 14) (2, 14) (18, 6) (18, 25) (18, 29) (28, 29) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 17) (29, 24) (17, 27) (17, 21) (17, 6) (17, 29) (24, 26) (24, 29) (24, 4) (24, 1) (24, 5) (20, 19) (20, 16) (25, 27) (25, 18) (5, 26) (5, 27) (5, 24) (4, 24) (4, 12) (4, 15) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 21) (12, 4) (19, 22) (19, 20) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 16) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 24) (1, 14) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 15) (3, 26) (3, 4) (16, 20) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 4) (15, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that have 3 edges, which would form a 3-star. We can observe the following nodes with 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 13 (connected to nodes 22, 8, and 1)
- Node 22 (connected to nodes 13, 19, and 27)
- Node 9 (connected to nodes 26, 6, and 8)
- Node 1 (connected to nodes 13, 7, and 24)
- Node 24 (connected to nodes 26, 5, and 4)
- Node 26 (connected to nodes 9, 8, and 5)
- Node 16 (connected to nodes 20, 10, and 27)
- Node 27 (connected to nodes 25, 10, and 5)
- Node 7 (connected to nodes 21, 6, and 1)
- Node 21 (connected to nodes 7, 12, and 17)
- Node 8 (connected to nodes 13, 9, and 23)
- Node 6 (connected to nodes 9, 7, and 17)
- Node 23 (connected to nodes 7, 8, and 14)
- Node 18 (connected to nodes 6, 25, and 29)
- Node 29 (connected to nodes 18, 28, and 17)
- Node 17 (connected to nodes 27, 21, and 6)
- Node 4 (connected to nodes 24, 12, and 15)
- Node 5 (connected to nodes 26, 27, and 24)
- Node 10 (connected to nodes 0, 27, and 16)
- Node 14 (connected to nodes 23, 2, and 15)
- Node 3 (connected to nodes 26, 4, and 15)

Next, let's count the number of unique 3-stars. 
Now we can count the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (13, 8, 24)>
- <4, (24, 12, 15)>
- <5, (26, 27, 24)>
- <6, (9, 7, 17)>
- <7, (21, 6, 1)>
- <8, (13, 9, 23)>
- <9, (26, 6, 8)>
- <10, (27, 16, 10)>
- <13, (22, 8, 1)>
- <14, (23, 2, 15)>
- <15, (13, 4, 14)>
- <16, (20, 27, 10)>
- <17, (27, 21, 6)>
- <18, (6, 25, 29)>
- <19, (22, 20, 16)>
- <22, (13, 19, 27)>
- <23, (7, 8, 14)>
- <24, (26, 5, 4)>
- <25, (27, 18, 29)>
- <26, (9, 8, 5)>
- <27, (25, 10, 5)>
- <29, (18, 28, 17)>

Therefore, there are 21 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
