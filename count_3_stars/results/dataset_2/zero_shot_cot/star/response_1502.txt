Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 27) (11, 5) (11, 12) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 14) (1, 16) (1, 21) (21, 1) (21, 4) (0, 27) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 2) (27, 11) (27, 0) (27, 13) (27, 23) (3, 10) (18, 5) (18, 29) (22, 12) (20, 0) (20, 14) (20, 28) (19, 26) (19, 4) (19, 24) (26, 19) (26, 28) (26, 25) (9, 24) (9, 14) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 10) (28, 23) (6, 15) (6, 4) (8, 16) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 7) (5, 11) (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 25) (12, 11) (12, 22) (12, 2) (12, 24) (12, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (15, 6) (15, 12) (15, 25) (4, 21) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 5) (29, 18) (29, 24) (10, 3) (10, 28) (10, 8) (24, 19) (24, 9) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 13) (23, 27) (23, 28) (25, 0) (25, 26) (25, 2) (25, 15) (17, 8) (17, 5) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 9) (14, 13) (13, 27) (13, 7) (13, 24) (13, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the possible 3-stars in the graph. 

1. 3-star with central node 0: <0, (27, 20, 25)>
2. 3-star with central node 1: <1, (16, 21, 4)>
3. 3-star with central node 2: <2, (12, 25, 0)>
4. 3-star with central node 3: <3, (10, 18, )>
5. 3-star with central node 4: <4, (21, 19, 6)>
6. 3-star with central node 5: <5, (11, 18, 17)>
7. 3-star with central node 6: <6, (15, 4, )>
8. 3-star with central node 7: <7, (13, 8, )>
9. 3-star with central node 8: <8, (16, 10, 17)>
10. 3-star with central node 9: <9, (24, 14, )>
11. 3-star with central node 10: <10, (3, 28, 8)>
12. 3-star with central node 11: <11, (27, 5, )>
13. 3-star with central node 12: <12, (22, 2, 15)>
14. 3-star with central node 13: <13, (27, 7, )>
15. 3-star with central node 14: <14, (16, 20, 9)>
16. 3-star with central node 15: <15, (6, 12, 25)>
17. 3-star with central node 16: <16, (1, 14, )>
18. 3-star with central node 17: <17, (8, 5, )>
19. 3-star with central node 18: <18, (5, 29, )>
20. 3-star with central node 19: <19, (26, 4, 24)>
21. 3-star with central node 20: <20, (0, 14, 28)>
22. 3-star with central node 21: <21, (1, 4, )>
23. 3-star with central node 22: <22, (12, , )>
24. 3-star with central node 23: <23, (27, 28, )>
25. 3-star with central node 24: <24, (19, 9, 13)>
26. 3-star with central node 25: <25, (2, 15, )>
27. 3-star with central node 26: <26, (19, 28, )>
28. 3-star with central node 27: <27, (11, 0, 13)>
29. 3-star with central node 28: <28, (20, 26, 23)>
30. 3-star with central node 29: <29, (18, 24, )>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
