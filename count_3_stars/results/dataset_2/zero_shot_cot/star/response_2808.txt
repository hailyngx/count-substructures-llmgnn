Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 5: <5, (9, 8, 1)>  
2. Node 9: <9, (5, 8, 4)>
3. Node 4: <4, (9, 7, 8)>
4. Node 7: <7, (5, 4, 0)>
5. Node 6: <6, (7, 2, 1)>
6. Node 8: <8, (9, 5, 4)>
7. Node 2: <2, (5, 6, 1)>
8. Node 0: <0, (4, 7, 3)>
9. Node 1: <1, (5, 6, 2)>
10. Node 3: <3, (9, 8, 0)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [10].
