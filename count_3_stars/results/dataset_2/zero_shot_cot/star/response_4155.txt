Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (10, 17) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 15) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 11) (15, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star, which consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's find all the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<0, (4, 6, 17)>
<1, (6, 9, 19)>
<2, (12, 15, 16)>
<3, (10, 12, 14)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (4, 16, 18)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (4, 7, 14)>
<8, (6, 10, 11)>
<9, (1, 13, 19)>
<10, (3, 8, 11)>
<11, (8, 10, 15)>
<12, (2, 13, 3)>
<13, (9, 12, 16)>
<14, (3, 7, 17)>
<15, (2, 11, 15)>
<16, (2, 13, 18)>
<17, (0, 14, 17)>
<18, (0, 16, 5)>
<19, (1, 9, 11)>

There are 20 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [20].
