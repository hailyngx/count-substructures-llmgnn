Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will identify each 3-star in the graph. 

Let's start by listing all unique 3-stars:

<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<3, (6, 4, 1)>
<4, (6, 7, 3)>
<5, (4, 7, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [5] 3-stars in the graph.
