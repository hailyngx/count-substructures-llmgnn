Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 14) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 17) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 18) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 7) (4, 2) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 19) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 19) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 6) (0, 3) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 16) (15, 17) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 14) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 16) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes are potential centers of 3-stars. 
Nodes with three edges: 1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 20

Now, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (4, 12, 19)>
<2, (4, 6, 13)>
<3, (0, 12, 16)>
<4, (1, 2, 12)>
<5, (7, 13, 14)>
<6, (7, 16, 2)>
<7, (6, 13, 11)>
<8, (2, 8, 14)>
<11, (7, 11, 17)>
<12, (4, 12, 19)>
<13, (5, 7, 15)>
<14, (5, 8, 19)>
<16, (1, 3, 6)>
<17, (10, 11, 15)>
<18, (11, 17, 18)>
<19, (4, 12, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
