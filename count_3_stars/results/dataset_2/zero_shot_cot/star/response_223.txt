Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (2, 4, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 7)>

As we can see, there are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
