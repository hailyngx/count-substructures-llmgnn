Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 26) (22, 19) (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 1) (26, 22) (26, 9) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 27) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 27) (17, 11) (5, 0) (5, 27) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 28) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 25) (28, 10) (28, 27) (28, 15) (29, 7) (4, 14) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 25) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 4) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 8) (21, 14) (21, 10) (21, 12) (2, 3) (2, 24) (12, 14) (12, 21) (12, 25) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 15) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (15, 28) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 24) (7, 29) (20, 26) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 0) (24, 17) (24, 2) (24, 15) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (23, 17) (23, 25) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 25) (16, 8) (25, 11) (25, 4) (25, 12) (25, 23) (25, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 11 is connected to nodes 1, 26, and 17. <11, (1, 26, 17)>
2. Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 17, and 21. <14, (4, 17, 21)>
3. Node 17 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 27. <17, (11, 14, 27)>
4. Node 21 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 14. <21, (10, 12, 14)>
5. Node 26 is connected to nodes 9, 22, and 27. <26, (9, 22, 27)>
6. Node 27 is connected to nodes 4, 17, and 28. <27, (4, 17, 28)>
7. Node 28 is connected to nodes 10, 15, and 27. <28, (10, 15, 27)>
8. Node 25 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 23. <25, (8, 12, 23)>
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 25. <8, (1, 3, 25)>
10. Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 9, and 11. <1, (8, 9, 11)>
11. Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 19. <3, (2, 8, 19)>
12. Node 15 is connected to nodes 18, 19, and 28. <15, (18, 19, 28)>
13. Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 18, and 21. <10, (11, 18, 21)>
14. Node 4 is connected to nodes 14, 25, and 27. <4, (14, 25, 27)>
15. Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 15, and 10. <18, (9, 15, 10)>
16. Node 15 is connected to nodes 18, 19, and 24. <15, (18, 19, 24)>
17. Node 12 is connected to nodes 14, 21, and 25. <12, (14, 21, 25)>
18. Node 19 is connected to nodes 3, 15, and 22. <19, (3, 15, 22)>
19. Node 21 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 14. (repeated) - Already counted
20. Node 22 is connected to nodes 19, 26, and 6. <22, (19, 26, 6)>
21. Node 23 is connected to nodes 17, 25, and 7. <23, (17, 25, 7)>
22. Node 24 is connected to nodes 15, 17, and 2. <24, (15, 17, 2)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars: [22]
