Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 12) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0: 2, 8, 13
Node 1: 5, 4, 12, 14
Node 2: 6, 8, 7
Node 3: 7, 4, 14
Node 4: 10, 1, 3
Node 5: 9, 12, 1, 11, 7
Node 6: 14, 2, 13
Node 7: 5, 11, 2, 8, 3, 14
Node 8: 10, 2, 0, 7, 12
Node 9: 5, 10, 12
Node 10: 9, 11, 8, 4
Node 11: 5, 10, 7, 13, 12
Node 12: 5, 9, 11, 8, 1
Node 13: 6, 11, 0
Node 14: 6, 1, 3, 7

Next, let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors connected to it: {9, 12, 1, 11, 7}. This forms a 3-star <5, (9, 12, 1)>.
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors connected to it: {5, 11, 2, 8, 3, 14}. This forms two 3-stars: <7, (5, 11, 2)> and <7, (5, 14, 3)>.
- Node 12 has 5 neighbors connected to it: {5, 9, 11, 8, 1}. This forms a 3-star <12, (5, 9, 11)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars found are <5, (9, 12, 1)>, <7, (5, 11, 2)>, and <12, (5, 9, 11)>.
