Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 0) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <0, (8, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 12, 11)>
- <2, (8, 5, 10)>
- <6, (9, 12, 4)>
- <7, (4, 11, 14)>
- <9, (6, 11, 14)>
- <10, (3, 13, 7)>
- <13, (3, 8, 10)>
- <14, (9, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [9].
