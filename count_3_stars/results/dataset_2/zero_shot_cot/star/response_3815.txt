Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 7) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 13) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (3, 8, 11)>
<1, (12, 13, 14)>
<2, (0, 13, 4)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 12)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (0, 10, 12)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (13, 14, 9)>
<10, (0, 7, 14)>
<11, (1, 13, 0)>
<12, (1, 5, 7)>
<13, (1, 2, 11)>
<14, (1, 9, 10)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 15.]
