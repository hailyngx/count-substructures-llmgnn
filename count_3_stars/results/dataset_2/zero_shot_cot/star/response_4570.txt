Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 15) (16, 6) (4, 18) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 17) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 14) (8, 10) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (5, 17) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 17) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 16) (15, 18) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 0) (17, 11) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 18) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs, we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by analyzing each node:

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 10, 3 (Degree: 3)
2. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 2 (Degree: 3)
3. Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 1, 14 (Degree: 4)
4. Node 3 is connected to nodes 16, 7, 13, 19, 0 (Degree: 5)
5. Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 0 (Degree: 2)
6. Node 5 is connected to node 17 (Degree: 1)
7. Node 6 is connected to nodes 16, 9, 2 (Degree: 3)
8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 17 (Degree: 2)
9. Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 13 (Degree: 2)
10. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 18, 1 (Degree: 3)
11. Node 10 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 14 (Degree: 3)
12. Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 17 (Degree: 2)
13. Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 2, 19 (Degree: 3)
14. Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 12, 3, 1 (Degree: 4)
15. Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 2, 1 (Degree: 3)
16. Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 18 (Degree: 2)
17. Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 15, 6, 3 (Degree: 4)
18. Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 5, 18, 11 (Degree: 4)
19. Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 15, 17 (Degree: 4)

Now, let's identify the 3-star graphs. There are 8 3-stars in this graph. The 3-star configurations are as follows:
<0, (4, 10, 3)>
<1, (9, 13, 2)>
<2, (6, 12, 1)>
<3, (16, 7, 13)>
<6, (16, 9, 2)>
<9, (6, 18, 1)>
<10, (0, 8, 14)>
<13, (8, 12, 3)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [8].
