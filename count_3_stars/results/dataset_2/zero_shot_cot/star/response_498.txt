Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs in this graph can be found by counting the number of nodes that have exactly 3 neighboring nodes.

Let's list down the nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors:
- Node 0: (4, 7, 6)
- Node 1: (7, 8, 6)
- Node 2: (7, 9, 3)
- Node 3: (4, 5, 6)
- Node 4: (0, 5, 3)
- Node 5: (4, 3, 6)
- Node 6: (8, 0, 1)
- Node 7: (0, 9, 8)
- Node 8: (7, 6, 1)
- Node 9: (7, 0, 2)

This results in 10 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 6)>
<1, (7, 8, 6)>
<2, (7, 9, 3)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 3)>
<5, (4, 3, 6)>
<6, (8, 0, 1)>
<7, (0, 9, 8)>
<8, (7, 6, 1)>
<9, (7, 0, 2)>
