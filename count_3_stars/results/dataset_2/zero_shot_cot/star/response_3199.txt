Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<9, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<7, (9, 4, 12)>
<1, (4, 3, 14)>
<3, (7, 1, 6)>
<10, (12, 11, 14)>
<11, (13, 2, 10)>
