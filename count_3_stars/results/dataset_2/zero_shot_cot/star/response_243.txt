Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 0) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 6) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 18) (17, 11) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 7) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (3, 5) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 9) (11, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (2, 12) (2, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 2) (15, 8) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 13) (13, 19) (13, 15) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 5, node 9, and node 14 respectively:

For node 5: (5, 3), (5, 7)
For node 9: (9, 11), (9, 7), (9, 0)
For node 14: (14, 17), (14, 0), (14, 6)

Next, let's find the 3-stars centered at node 5, node 9, and node 14 respectively:

For node 5: <5, (3, 7)>
For node 9: <9, (11, 7, 0)>
For node 14: <14, (17, 0, 6)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [3].
