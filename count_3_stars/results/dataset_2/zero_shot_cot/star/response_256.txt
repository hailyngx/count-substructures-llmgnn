Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (4, 0, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 0)>
<5, (7, 6, 2)>
<6, (8, 5, 0)>
<2, (8, 5, 9)>
<0, (7, 6, 1)>
<1, (7, 0, 3)>

From the list above, we can see that there are total [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
