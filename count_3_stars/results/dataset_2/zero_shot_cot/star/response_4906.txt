Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 11) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 3) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 12) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 4) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 12) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 19) (6, 9) (4, 21) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 20) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (19, 23) (19, 26) (19, 24) (26, 22) (26, 19) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 18) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 25) (17, 21) (17, 20) (17, 16) (20, 2) (20, 17) (20, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 24) (18, 11) (18, 10) (0, 28) (0, 24) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 29) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 20) (12, 29) (24, 19) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 10) (29, 5) (29, 16) (29, 12) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 10) (25, 21) (25, 22) (25, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, and 24 which form a 3-star: <1, (5, 9, 7)>
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8, 14, 20 which form a 3-star: <2, (8, 14, 20)>
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 15, 27, 12 which form a 3-star: <3, (15, 27, 12)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 21 which does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only one other node.
- Node 5 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9 which does not form a 3-star as it is connected to only one other node.
- Node 7 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 8 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 9 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 18, 24, 13 which form a 3-star: <10, (18, 24, 13)>
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 15, 28, 18 which form a 3-star: <11, (15, 28, 18)>
- Node 12 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 13 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 14 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 15 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 17, 29 which form a 3-star: <16, (7, 17, 29)>
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 21, 20, 16 which form a 3-star: <17, (21, 20, 16)>
- Node 18 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 23, 26, 24 which form a 3-star: <19, (23, 26, 24)>
- Node 20 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 21 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 23, 26, 12 which form a 3-star: <22, (23, 26, 12)>
- Node 23 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 24 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 21, 22, 28 which form a 3-star: <25, (21, 22, 28)>
- Node 26 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 27 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 28 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.
- Node 29 is part of a 3-star identified earlier.

Count of 3-stars: [8]
