Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 23) (13, 7) (13, 18) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 27) (22, 12) (3, 17) (3, 23) (3, 8) (15, 26) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 24) (9, 26) (9, 17) (9, 16) (26, 15) (26, 9) (26, 14) (4, 24) (4, 2) (7, 13) (0, 20) (0, 10) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 21) (20, 23) (20, 11) (1, 20) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 14) (10, 0) (21, 13) (21, 20) (21, 18) (14, 22) (14, 26) (14, 1) (14, 18) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (12, 22) (12, 18) (16, 9) (16, 1) (16, 19) (11, 20) (11, 2) (6, 25) (6, 8) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 9) (5, 23) (5, 27) (23, 13) (23, 3) (23, 20) (23, 5) (27, 22) (27, 5) (27, 29) (27, 24) (29, 27) (29, 19) (29, 25) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 29) (18, 13) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 12) (24, 15) (24, 4) (24, 27) (25, 6) (25, 29) (25, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. 
We will then determine which of these connections form 3-stars.
Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:
<13, (18, 21, 7)>
<22, (2, 12, 27)>
<3, (17, 8, 23)>
<15, (8, 17, 26)>
<9, (17, 16, 26)>
<26, (9, 14, 15)>
<4, (2, 24, 15)>
<7, (13, 18, -)>
<0, (20, 19, 10)>
<20, (1, 21, 23)>
<1, (14, 16, 20)>
<10, (0, 19, -)>
<21, (13, 18, 20)>
<14, (1, 18, 26)>
<2, (1, 11, 22)>
<12, (18, -, 22)>
<16, (1, 19, 9)>
<11, (2, -, 20)>
<6, (8, 25, -)>
<5, (23, 27, -)>
<27, (22, 29, 5)>
<29, (19, 25, 27)>
<19, (0, 29, 16)>
<18, (12, 13, 14)>
<24, (4, 27, 15)>
<25, (6, 29, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 25)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [27]
