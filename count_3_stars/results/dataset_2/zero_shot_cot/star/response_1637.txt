Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are as follows:
<5, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<4, (5, 9, 7)>
<7, (4, 1, 0)>
<6, (9, 4, 3)>
<1, (9, 7, 3)>
<3, (5, 6, 1)>
<2, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (6, 1, 0)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
