Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Given the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges, let's first identify the nodes in the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

1. <0, (1, 3, 8)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 5)>
3. <2, (5, 6, 9)>
4. <3, (0, 4, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 3, 7)>
6. <5, (1, 2, 3)>
7. <6, (2, 7, 9)>
8. <7, (4, 6, 1)>
9. <8, (0, 3, 2)>
10. <9, (2, 6, 4)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
