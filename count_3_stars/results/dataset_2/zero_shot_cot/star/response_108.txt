Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three edges connecting them to three other nodes. Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 0)>

Since we have found 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph, the final answer is [9].
