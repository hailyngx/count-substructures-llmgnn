Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 22) (14, 18) (14, 20) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 27) (17, 15) (2, 12) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 7) (29, 5) (29, 11) (22, 14) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 3) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 6) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 6) (20, 14) (20, 21) (20, 28) (5, 29) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 27) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 0) (18, 14) (18, 19) (26, 2) (26, 10) (26, 4) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 24) (1, 8) (3, 22) (3, 10) (21, 20) (21, 19) (21, 4) (8, 1) (8, 12) (9, 4) (9, 11) (25, 0) (25, 11) (27, 17) (27, 5) (19, 17) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 21) (12, 2) (12, 8) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 7) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 25) (0, 16) (0, 24) (16, 0) (16, 13) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 13) (28, 20) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 24) (11, 29) (11, 9) (11, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in the given graph. 
From the edges listed, we find the following nodes connected to other nodes:

Center nodes: 14, 17, 2, 29, 22, 23, 15, 20, 5, 6, 18, 26, 1, 3, 21, 8, 9, 25, 27, 19, 12, 10, 0, 16, 4, 7, 24, 28, 13, 11

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
A 3-star consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Following are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (29, 23, 6)>
<4, (26, 21, 7)>
<1, (8, 24, 10)>
<6, (15, 1, 23)>
<16, (0, 13, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
