Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 17) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 18) (7, 18) (7, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 18) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (16, 0) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 17) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 2) (19, 3) (19, 15) (6, 17) (6, 2) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 8) (2, 5) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 10) (8, 15) (8, 17) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are part of any 3-star configuration. These are nodes that have exactly 3 incident edges.

Nodes with exactly 3 incident edges:
- Node 4: (4, 18)
- Node 7: (7, 18), (7, 13), (13, 7)
- Node 8: (8, 15), (8, 17), (17, 8)

Next, let's find the 3-star configurations that can be formed using the above nodes and their incident edges.

So, we have:
- <4, (18, 7, 13)>
- <7, (18, 4, 13)>
- <7, (13, 18, 8)>
- <8, (15, 17, 7)>
- <8, (17, 15, 13)>

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
