Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 15) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 0) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 17) (9, 3) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 10) (11, 17) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 7) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 11) (5, 18) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 0) (6, 3) (14, 8) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 5) (15, 4) (15, 17) 

Response:
Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Let's list them out:

<7, (12, 16, 19)>
<12, (7, 13, 1)>
<4, (18, 19, 10)>
<18, (4, 7, 5)>
<13, (12, 1, 0)>
<17, (8, 16, 15)>
<3, (9, 0, 6)>
<1, (12, 13, 11)>
<11, (17, 1, 19)>
<6, (0, 3, 14)>
<5, (18, 3, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique ones:

Total number of 3-stars: [10]
