Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 25) (5, 22) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 20) (9, 27) (6, 9) (6, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 24) (0, 5) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 9) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 7) (20, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 10) (24, 8) (24, 1) (24, 29) (26, 0) (26, 14) (26, 11) (26, 3) (17, 20) (17, 28) (17, 27) (17, 18) (16, 28) (16, 14) (28, 17) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 2) (10, 18) (21, 12) (14, 8) (14, 26) (14, 16) (3, 26) (3, 13) (7, 6) (7, 20) (7, 13) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 29) (1, 11) (1, 13) (29, 24) (29, 1) (29, 25) (29, 23) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 23) (22, 5) (22, 12) (27, 9) (27, 17) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 15) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 15) (12, 21) (12, 22) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 25) (23, 20) (23, 29) (23, 19) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to count the number of 3-stars.

Nodes with their degrees:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 0
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 3
- Node 10: degree 2
- Node 11: degree 4
- Node 12: degree 2
- Node 13: degree 4
- Node 14: degree 4
- Node 15: degree 3
- Node 16: degree 2
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 3
- Node 20: degree 5
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 2
- Node 23: degree 3
- Node 24: degree 3
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 4
- Node 27: degree 2
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

Now let's construct the 3-stars by considering the nodes' connectivity:

<0, (20, 13, 11)>
<1, (2, 24, 29)>
<2, (8, 1, 19)>
<3, (26, 13, 7)>
<5, (22, 25, 0)>
<6, (9, 7, 27)>
<8, (24, 14, 2)>
<14, (8, 26, 16)>
<15, (28, 25, 18)>
<17, (20, 27, 18)>
<18, (17, 10, 15)>
<20, (0, 9, 17)>
<24, (8, 1, 29)>
<25, (15, 29, 5)>
<26, (3, 0, 14)>
<28, (15, 16, 17)>
<29, (24, 1, 25)>
