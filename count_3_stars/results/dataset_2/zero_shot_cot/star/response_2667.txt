Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's go step-by-step:

1. First, identify the nodes that are central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 2.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 5.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 5, and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and no other node, but it doesn't have exactly three neighbors.
- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, and 7 do not have exactly three neighbors.

2. Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <4, (7, 8, 1)>
- <8, (4, 1, 2)>
- <1, (4, 3, 5)>
- <6, (7, 5, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
