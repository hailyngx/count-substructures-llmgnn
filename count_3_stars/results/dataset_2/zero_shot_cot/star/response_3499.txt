Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph: 

<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars.
