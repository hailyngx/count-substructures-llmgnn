Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 27) (4, 0) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 23) (7, 26) (21, 28) (21, 18) (21, 29) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 16) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 0) (1, 16) (1, 18) (26, 7) (26, 15) (26, 20) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 18) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 20) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 15) (23, 7) (23, 11) (23, 27) (17, 25) (17, 22) (25, 13) (25, 17) (25, 10) (22, 5) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 19) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 12) (18, 21) (18, 1) (18, 0) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (16, 13) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 15) (24, 16) (24, 3) (15, 26) (15, 11) (15, 16) (3, 19) (3, 2) (3, 24) (20, 26) (20, 14) (20, 12) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 20) (10, 6) (10, 28) (10, 25) (10, 2) (27, 9) (27, 8) (27, 23) (29, 4) (29, 21) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are directly connected to a node.

Node 0: 4, 6, 18, 14
Node 1: 16, 18
Node 2: 4, 10, 3
Node 3: 19, 2, 24
Node 4: 0, 29, 2
Node 5: 9, 6, 22
Node 6: 5, 8, 10, 0
Node 7: 23, 26
Node 8: 13, 6, 27
Node 9: 5, 11, 27
Node 10: 6, 2, 28, 25
Node 11: 9, 23, 15
Node 12: 28, 19, 20
Node 13: 8, 25, 16
Node 14: 0, 22, 20
Node 15: 26, 11, 16
Node 16: 1, 13, 24, 15
Node 17: 25, 22
Node 18: 21, 1, 0
Node 19: 22, 3, 12
Node 20: 26, 14, 12
Node 21: 28, 18, 29
Node 22: 5, 14, 17, 19
Node 23: 7, 11, 27
Node 24: 16, 3
Node 25: 13, 17, 10
Node 26: 7, 15, 20
Node 27: 9, 8, 23
Node 28: 21, 12, 10
Node 29: 4, 21

Next, let's identify the 3-star configurations.

<0, (4, 6, 18)>
<1, (16, 18, 0)>
<2, (4, 10, 3)>
<3, (19, 2, 24)>
<4, (0, 29, 2)>
<5, (9, 6, 22)>
<6, (5, 8, 10)>
<7, (23, 26, 15)>
<8, (13, 6, 27)>
<8, (13, 25, 16)>
<9, (5, 11, 27)>
<10, (6, 2, 28)>
<10, (6, 10, 25)>
<11, (9, 23, 15)>
<12, (28, 21, 29)>
<13, (8, 25, 17)>
<14, (0, 22, 20)>
<15, (26, 14, 20)>
<16, (1, 13, 24)>
<17, (25, 22, 19)>
<18, (21, 1, 0)>
<19, (22, 3, 12)>
<20, (26, 14, 12)>
<21, (28, 21, 29)>
<22, (5, 17, 19)>
<23, (27, 9, 11)>
<24, (16, 3, 15)>
<25, (10, 17, 13)>
<26, (20, 23, 15)>
<27, (23, 9, 27)>
<28, (21, 12, 10)>
