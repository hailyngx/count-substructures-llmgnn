Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (1, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars. 

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected with exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to 5, 7, 10, 11
- Node 2 is connected to 4, 6, 9, 14
- Node 3 is connected to 0, 5, 8, 9, 10
- Node 5 is connected to 3, 4, 6, 13, 14
- Node 6 is connected to 2, 5, 10, 14
- Node 9 is connected to 2, 3, 4, 11
- Node 10 is connected to 0, 6, 12, 13
- Node 11 is connected to 4, 9, 0
- Node 12 is connected to 7, 10, 8
- Node 13 is connected to 5, 10, 1
- Node 14 is connected to 2, 5, 6, 8

2. From the nodes identified above, find the unique 3-star patterns:
- <0, (3, 5, 10)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 14)>
- <6, (2, 5, 10)>
- <9, (2, 4, 11)>
- <10, (0, 6, 13)>
- <11, (4, 9, 0)>
- <12, (7, 10, 8)>
- <13, (5, 10, 1)>
- <14, (2, 6, 8)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars found:
- [10]
