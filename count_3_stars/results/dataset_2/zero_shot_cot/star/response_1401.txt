Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 22) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 6) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 22) (2, 1) (2, 24) (2, 28) (2, 0) (18, 20) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (19, 13) (26, 5) (26, 6) (26, 12) (26, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 28) (0, 23) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 28) (3, 16) (3, 8) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 27) (4, 26) (4, 24) (4, 14) (22, 20) (22, 17) (22, 6) (5, 25) (5, 11) (5, 26) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 25) (6, 26) (6, 22) (6, 1) (6, 12) (29, 7) (28, 2) (28, 0) (28, 7) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 27) (24, 2) (24, 7) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 27) (9, 10) (9, 23) (9, 12) (27, 16) (27, 8) (27, 24) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 16) (13, 14) (12, 26) (12, 6) (12, 9) (23, 0) (23, 9) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we need to count the number of 3-stars. Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
2. For each of these nodes, check if they are forming a 3-star configuration.

The <3-stars> in this graph are:
<0, (2, 7, 28)>
<2, (1, 18, 24)>
<7, (0, 24, 28)>
<24, (2, 4, 8)>
<8, (3, 15, 27)>
<15, (10, 20, 8)>
<10, (9, 15, 17)>
<9, (12, 23, 10)>
<12, (6, 9, 26)>
<26, (4, 5, 12)>
<5, (6, 11, 25)>
<11, (5, 13, 14)>
<13, (11, 14, 16)>
<14, (4, 11, 13)>
<4, (14, 22, 24)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
