Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 13 (connected to 22, 26, and 5) -> <13, (22, 26, 5)>
2. Node 22 (connected to 13, 10, and 21) -> <22, (13, 10, 21)>
3. Node 5 (connected to 13, 9, and 3) -> <5, (13, 9, 3)>
4. Node 9 (connected to 5, 8, and 21) -> <9, (5, 8, 21)>
5. Node 4 (connected to 23, 0, and 24) -> <4, (23, 0, 24)>
6. Node 3 (connected to 13, 25, and 23) -> <3, (13, 25, 23)>
7. Node 25 (connected to 3, 16, and 29) -> <25, (3, 16, 29)>
8. Node 21 (connected to 22, 9, and -) -> <21, (22, 9, -)>
9. Node 0 (connected to 4, 27, and 18) -> <0, (4, 27, 18)>
10. Node 27 (connected to 0, 18, and 6) -> <27, (0, 18, 6)>
11. Node 26 (connected to 13, 0, and 18) -> <26, (13, 0, 18)>
12. Node 18 (connected to 7, 0, and 27) -> <18, (7, 0, 27)>
13. Node 8 (connected to 22, 9, and 28) -> <8, (22, 9, 28)>
14. Node 29 (connected to 25, 6, and 20) -> <29, (25, 6, 20)>
15. Node 10 (connected to 22, 1, and 14) -> <10, (22, 1, 14)>
16. Node 15 (connected to 13, 8, and 23) -> <15, (13, 8, 23)>
17. Node 16 (connected to 25, 2, and 14) -> <16, (25, 2, 14)>
18. Node 1 (connected to 7, 10, and 19) -> <1, (7, 10, 19)>
19. Node 28 (connected to 8, 15, and -) -> <28, (8, 15, -)>
20. Node 11 (connected to 19, 2, and -) -> <11, (19, 2, -)>
21. Node 24 (connected to 4, 29, and 2) -> <24, (4, 29, 2)>
22. Node 19 (connected to 1, 11, and 17) -> <19, (1, 11, 17)>
23. Node 14 (connected to 10, 16, and -) -> <14, (10, 16, -)>
24. Node 2 (connected to 26, 16, and 11) -> <2, (26, 16, 11)>
25. Node 23 (connected to 4, 3, and 15) -> <23, (4, 3, 15)>
26. Node 12 (connected to 1, 17, and -) -> <12, (1, 17, -)>
27. Node 17 (connected to 19, 12, and -) -> <17, (19, 12, -)>
28. Node 6 (connected to 27, 29, and -) -> <6, (27, 29, -)>
29. Node 7 (connected to 18, 1, and -) -> <7, (18, 1, -)>
30. Node 20 (connected to 29, - , -) -> <20, (29, - , -)>

There are a total of 30 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the output is: [30].
