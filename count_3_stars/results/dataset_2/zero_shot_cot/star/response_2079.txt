Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 1.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 4, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have a total of [3] 3-stars in the given graph.
