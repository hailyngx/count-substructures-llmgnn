Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 2) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 9) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 6) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (10, 8) (10, 14) 

Response:
The central nodes in a 3-star cannot be leaves of another 3-star. Since the central node in a 3-star is connected to 3 leaves, let's look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

After going through the given edges, we find the following nodes with 3 connections:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 12.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 12, and 1.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 1, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 7, 2, and 0.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 11, 2, and 9.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8 and 14.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- 3-star with central node 4: <4, (7, 8, 12)>
- 3-star with central node 7: <7, (4, 11, 5)>
- 3-star with central node 8: <8, (4, 10, 12)>
- 3-star with central node 12: <12, (4, 8, 6)>
- 3-star with central node 6: <6, (3, 12, 1)>
- 3-star with central node 14: <14, (7, 1, 6)>
- 3-star with central node 5: <5, (7, 2, 0)>
- 3-star with central node 13: <13, (11, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
