Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 12) (26, 14) (26, 15) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 21) (5, 16) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 7) (2, 15) (29, 5) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 25) (4, 7) (4, 22) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (8, 16) (8, 21) (13, 12) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 17) (3, 6) (25, 29) (25, 3) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 27) (12, 20) (27, 12) (0, 28) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 11) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 24) (6, 1) (10, 11) (10, 23) (10, 28) (11, 4) (11, 20) (11, 10) (11, 18) (23, 10) (23, 15) (23, 16) (24, 6) (24, 17) (24, 28) (21, 5) (21, 8) (14, 26) (14, 4) (14, 28) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 1) (19, 2) (19, 18) (22, 4) (22, 28) (1, 6) (1, 18) (1, 16) (17, 3) (17, 24) (15, 26) (15, 2) (15, 23) (28, 0) (28, 10) (28, 24) (28, 14) (28, 22) (16, 5) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:

<3, (7, 25, 6)>
<4, (7, 14, 22)>
<5, (9, 6, 21)>
<5, (29, 2, 20)>
<6, (5, 3, 24)>
<10, (11, 28, 23)>
<12, (9, 13, 27)>
<15, (26, 2, 23)>
<16, (8, 21, 1)>
<28, (0, 10, 24)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
