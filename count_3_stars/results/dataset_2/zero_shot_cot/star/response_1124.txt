Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes of the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

[There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph.]

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
