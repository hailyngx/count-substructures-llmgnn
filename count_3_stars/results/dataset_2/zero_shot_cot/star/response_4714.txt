Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are in a 3-star configuration. 
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 9, 1, 4, and 3. This forms a 3-star with 5 as the center and leaves 9, 1, and 4: <5, (9, 1, 4)>
- Node 9 has edges with nodes 5, 6, 4, 1, and 7. This forms two 3-stars with 9 as the center: <9, (5, 6, 4)> and <9, (1, 7, 0)>
- Node 6 has edges with nodes 9, 1, and 0. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has edges with nodes 5, 9, 3, 1, and 2. This forms a 3-star with 4 as the center and leaves 5, 3, and 2: <4, (5, 3, 2)>
- Node 7 has edges with nodes 9, 0, 3, 2, and 8. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 2 has edges with nodes 4, 7, 8, and 3. This forms a 3-star with 2 as the center and leaves 4, 7, and 8: <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 7 and 2. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 9, 6, and 7. This does not form a 3-star.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 5, 9, 6, and 4. This forms a 3-star with 1 as the center and leaves 5, 9, and 4: <1, (5, 9, 4)>
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 5, 4, 7, and 2. This does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 4. 
So, the final answer is [4].
