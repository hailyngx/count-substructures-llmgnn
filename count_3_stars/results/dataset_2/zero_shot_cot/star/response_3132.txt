Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 26) (16, 5) (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 7) (27, 19) (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 18) (25, 3) (25, 18) (18, 3) (18, 25) (18, 22) (18, 0) (22, 18) (22, 9) (22, 24) (22, 8) (28, 9) (28, 13) (28, 20) (29, 15) (29, 1) (29, 5) (2, 0) (8, 22) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 18) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 1) (9, 22) (9, 28) (9, 8) (9, 17) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 26) (21, 17) (7, 27) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 26) (26, 16) (26, 21) (26, 7) (26, 12) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 12) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 20) (24, 22) (24, 7) (24, 17) (5, 16) (5, 15) (5, 29) (23, 10) (23, 13) (23, 12) (12, 8) (12, 26) (12, 1) (12, 23) (20, 28) (20, 10) (20, 13) (4, 15) (4, 13) (19, 27) (19, 7) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 24) (13, 28) (13, 23) (13, 20) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to identify all the 3-stars in the given graph. 
Let's start by listing all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as the potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 15, 18, 0, 22, 9, 26, 1, 12, 20, and 4.

Now, we will examine each of these potential centers and identify the 3-stars they are part of:

For node 15:
- <15, (27, 3, 29)>
- <15, (5, 3, 29)>
- <15, (4, 3, 29)>
- <15, (27, 5, 29)>
- <15, (5, 27, 29)>

For node 18:
- <18, (25, 3, 22)>
- <18, (0, 3, 22)>
- <18, (25, 0, 22)>

For node 0:
- <0, (2, 18, 14)>
- <0, (10, 18, 14)>

For node 22:
- <22, (9, 24, 8)>
- <22, (18, 24, 8)>
- <22, (9, 24, 7)>
- <22, (18, 24, 7)>

For node 9:
- <9, (28, 8, 17)>
- <9,(22, 28, 17)>
- <9, (22, 8, 17)>

For node 26:
- <26, (21, 16, 7)>
- <26,(12, 16, 7)>

For node 1:
- <1, (14, 29, 12)>

For node 12:
- <12, (23, 8, 1)>
- <12, (23, 26, 1)>
- <12, (23, 1, 8)>

For node 20:
- <20, (28, 10, 13)>
- <20, (10, 13, 4)>

For node 4:
- <4, (15, 13, 29)>
- <4, (13, 20, 29)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 39
Answer: [39]
