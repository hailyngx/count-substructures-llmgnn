Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (26, 9) (26, 13) (26, 16) (1, 21) (1, 2) (21, 1) (21, 0) (21, 22) (21, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 20) (18, 22) (18, 11) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 10) (15, 5) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 11) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 20) (17, 10) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 0) (28, 9) (28, 11) (28, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 3) (11, 18) (11, 27) (11, 28) (11, 14) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 7) (13, 0) (20, 6) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 19) (29, 15) (29, 7) (29, 16) (25, 24) (14, 11) (14, 3) (7, 13) (7, 29) (7, 5) (5, 15) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 23) (23, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 19) (2, 1) (2, 21) (2, 28) (24, 12) (24, 13) (24, 25) (0, 21) (0, 12) (0, 13) (16, 9) (16, 26) (16, 13) (16, 29) (19, 10) (19, 20) (19, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars by checking each node if it is the center of a 3-star.

The nodes with exactly 3 edges are:
- Node 0 (Connected to 21, 12, 13)
- Node 4 (Connected to 8, 5, 8)
- Node 7 (Connected to 13, 29, 5)

Therefore, we have three 3-stars:
<0, (21, 12, 13)>
<4, (8, 5, 8)>
<7, (13, 29, 5)>
