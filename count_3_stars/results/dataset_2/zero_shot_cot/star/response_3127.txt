Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 18) (15, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (9, 17) (9, 4) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 17) (12, 11) (19, 7) (19, 16) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 16) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 8) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 2) (14, 5) (14, 7) (8, 6) (8, 17) (8, 1) (8, 18) 

Response:
First, we observe that a 3-star must have a center node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find all the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (11, 17, 18)>
<1, (4, 8, 11)>
<2, (7, 13, 16)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 13, 14)>
<6, (7, 8, 16)>
<7, (2, 14, 19)>
<8, (1, 6, 17)>
<11, (0, 1, 12)>
<13, (2, 5, 16)>
<14, (5, 7, 19)>
<16, (2, 6, 19)>
<17, (0, 8, 9)>
<18, (0, 3, 7)>
<19, (7, 16, 14)>

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: [14]
