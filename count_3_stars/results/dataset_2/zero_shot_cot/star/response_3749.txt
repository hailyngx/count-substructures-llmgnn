Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 21) (13, 29) (22, 5) (22, 0) (22, 20) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 17) (9, 6) (9, 29) (3, 25) (3, 18) (25, 3) (0, 22) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (20, 22) (20, 29) (20, 1) (20, 23) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 17) (8, 4) (8, 19) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 27) (28, 23) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 17) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 28) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 21) (5, 13) (5, 22) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 16) (24, 18) (29, 13) (29, 9) (29, 20) (29, 27) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (18, 3) (18, 24) (18, 10) (18, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 19) (10, 18) (10, 2) (11, 0) (11, 24) (11, 14) (14, 11) (17, 6) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 18) (16, 1) (16, 24) (16, 15) (21, 13) (21, 26) (27, 28) (27, 29) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 10) (15, 16) (23, 20) (23, 28) 

Response:
Observing the graph, we can see that the following 3-stars exist:
<0, (10, 11, 12)>
<1, (16, 20, 26)>
<2, (7, 10, 19)>
<3, (18, 25, 24)>
<4, (8, 12, 17)>
<5, (13, 22, 5)>
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 12, 17)>
<8, (4, 8, 19)>
<9, (6, 9, 29)>
<10, (0, 10, 12)>
<11, (0, 11, 24)>
<12, (4, 7, 12)>
<13, (5, 13, 29)>
<16, (1, 16, 26)>
<17, (4, 7, 17)>
<18, (3, 10, 18)>
<19, (2, 8, 19)>
<20, (1, 20, 22)>
<21, (13, 21, 26)>
<22, (5, 13, 22)>
<23, (20, 23, 28)>
<24, (11, 16, 24)>
<25, (3, 18, 25)>
<26, (1, 21, 26)>
<27, (28, 29, 27)>
<28, (6, 23, 28)>
<29, (9, 13, 29)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we find that there are [29] 3-stars.
