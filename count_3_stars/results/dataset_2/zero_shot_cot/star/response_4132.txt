Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 3) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 12) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 9) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
First, identify the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as potential centers of 3-star graphs. Then, check if each of these nodes indeed forms a 3-star graph with the connected nodes.

Here are the steps to count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
   - Node 4, Node 1, Node 3, Node 10, Node 8, Node 5, Node 6, Node 0, Node 14, Node 2, Node 12

2. Determine the 3-stars:
   - 3-star involving Node 4: <4, (7, 10, 1)>
   - 3-star involving Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 13)>
   - 3-star involving Node 3: <3, (0, 11, 6)>
   - 3-star involving Node 10: <10, (5, 9, 13)>
   - 3-star involving Node 8: <8, (11, 5, 14)>
   - 3-star involving Node 5: <5, (8, 10, 1)>
   - 3-star involving Node 6: <6, (7, 3, 13)>
   - 3-star involving Node 0: <0, (3, -1, -1)>  (not a valid 3-star)
   - 3-star involving Node 14: <14, (13, 11, 8)>
   - 3-star involving Node 2: <2, (9, 13, -1)>  (not a valid 3-star)
   - 3-star involving Node 12: <12, (1, 9, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [9]

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
