Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 20) (3, 27) (15, 14) (15, 24) (0, 27) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 19) (27, 3) (27, 0) (27, 8) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 7) (2, 18) (2, 22) (2, 13) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 18) (18, 2) (18, 29) (18, 9) (18, 11) (18, 17) (26, 28) (26, 20) (28, 26) (28, 19) (28, 24) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 17) (6, 10) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 4) (8, 27) (8, 21) (8, 9) (8, 7) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 4) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 23) (17, 4) (14, 15) (14, 21) (14, 11) (16, 0) (16, 29) (16, 5) (22, 2) (22, 12) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 20) (7, 1) (7, 29) (7, 8) (23, 17) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 10) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 11) (4, 21) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 25) (12, 1) (12, 22) (19, 0) (19, 28) (19, 25) (24, 15) (24, 28) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 20, and 27.
   <3, (1, 20, 27)>

2. Node 15 is connected to nodes 14 and 24 but does not have a third connection.

3. Node 0 is connected to nodes 27, 16, and 29.
   <0, (27, 16, 29)>

4. Node 27 is already counted in the first 3-star.

5. Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 13, and 12.
   <1, (3, 13, 12)>

6. Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 22, and 13.
   <2, (18, 22, 13)>

7. Node 29 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 16.
   <29, (0, 7, 16)>

8. Node 18 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

9. Node 26 and 28 are connected to each other but do not form a 3-star.

10. Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 16, and 6.
    <5, (10, 16, 6)>

11. Node 13 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

12. Node 21 is connected to nodes 8, 14, and 4.
    <21, (8, 14, 4)>

13. Node 8 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

14. Node 9 is connected to nodes 18, 25, and 4.
    <9, (18, 25, 4)>

15. Node 17 is connected to nodes 18, 13, and 23.
    <17, (18, 13, 23)>

16. Node 14 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

17. Node 16 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

18. Node 22 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

19. Node 11 is connected to nodes 18, 14, and 20.
    <11, (18, 14, 20)>

20. Node 7 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

21. Node 23 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

22. Node 25 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

23. Node 20 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

24. Node 4 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

25. Node 10 is already counted in a previous 3-star.

In total, there are [12] unique 3-stars in the given graph, as listed above.
