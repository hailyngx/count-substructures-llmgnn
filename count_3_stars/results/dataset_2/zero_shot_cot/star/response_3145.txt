Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 19) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 19) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 6) (2, 13) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 19) (7, 18) (7, 0) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 12) (3, 5) (3, 12) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 11) (19, 9) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 0) (15, 13) (15, 0) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
There are 3-star patterns in the given graph. Let's find them:

<0, (1, 15, 19)>
<1, (0, 8, 12)>
<2, (13, 18, 7)>
<3, (5, 12, 6)>
<4, (9, 11, 14)>
<5, (3, 11, 10)>
<6, (17, 13, 11)>
<7, (18, 0, 7)>
<8, (1, 13, 0)>
<9, (14, 10, 4)>
<10, (5, 9, 10)>
<11, (6, 4, 5)>
<12, (3, 16, 1)>
<13, (2, 6, 15)>
<14, (9, 16, 19)>
<15, (13, 0, 15)>
<16, (14, 12, 16)>
<17, (6, 19, 17)>
<18, (7, 2, 18)>
<19, (0, 14, 19)>

Therefore, there are a total of [20] 3-star patterns in the graph.
