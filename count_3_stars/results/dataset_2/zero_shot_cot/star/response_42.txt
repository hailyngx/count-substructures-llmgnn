Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them, as they can potentially be central nodes of 3-stars.
   - Node 5 has 5 edges connected to it.
   - Node 9 has 5 edges connected to it.
   - Node 6 has 4 edges connected to it.
   - Node 4 has 3 edges connected to it.
   - Node 7 has 2 edges connected to it.
   - Node 2 has 5 edges connected to it.
   - Node 8 has 5 edges connected to it.
   - Node 1 has 4 edges connected to it.
   - Node 3 has 4 edges connected to it.
   - Node 0 has 4 edges connected to it.

Nodes 5, 9, 8, and 2 have exactly 3 edges connected to them and can be central nodes of 3-stars.

Now, let's find 3-stars using these central nodes:
   - For node 5: (5, 9, 6), (5, 9, 1), (5, 6, 8), (5, 6, 9), (5, 8, 6)
   - For node 9: (9, 5, 6), (9, 5, 1), (9, 6, 5), (9, 6, 4), (9, 6, 9)
   - For node 8: (8, 5, 6), (8, 6, 5), (8, 5, 1), (8, 5, 0), (8, 6, 4)
   - For node 2: (2, 7, 8), (2, 8, 7), (2, 8, 5), (2, 8, 0), (2, 8, 6)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14]. 

Unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<5, (9, 1, 6)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 6, 9)>
<9, (5, 1, 6)>
<9, (6, 4, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 4)>
<2, (7, 8, 5)>
<2, (8, 7, 2)>
<2, (8, 5, 0)>
<2, (8, 0, 5)>
