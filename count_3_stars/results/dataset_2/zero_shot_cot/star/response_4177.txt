Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's find all nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them. These nodes will serve as the centers of the 3-stars. 

Nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them: 5, 9, 4, 3, 2, 0

Next, for each of these nodes, let's find the neighboring nodes that are connected by an edge. These neighboring nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars.

1. Node 5: (9, 6, 2), (9, 8, 1), (9, 7, 0), (4, 7, 1), (7, 9, 5), (1, 4, 5), (8, 1, 5)
2. Node 9: (5, 2, 7), (5, 3, 7), (5, 7, 4), (2, 5, 9), (3, 0, 9), (7, 4, 9)
3. Node 4: (7, 1, 6), (1, 5, 4), (6, 7, 4)
4. Node 3: (9, 0, 6), (0, 7, 3), (6, 8, 3)
5. Node 2: (5, 9, 5)
6. Node 0: (7, 3, 8), (3, 6, 0), (8, 0, 7)

So, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<5, (9, 7, 0)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<3, (9, 0, 6)>
<0, (7, 3, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
