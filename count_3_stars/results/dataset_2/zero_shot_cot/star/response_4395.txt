Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three edges connected to them. These nodes would serve as the centers of 3-stars.

The nodes with three edges connected to them are: 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, 2.

Now, let's list out the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 8, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (5, 8, 3)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<4, (6, 8, 2)>
<8, (9, 5, 4)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
