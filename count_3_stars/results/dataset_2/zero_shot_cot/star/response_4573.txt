Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 0) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 18) (2, 13) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 1) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 15) (13, 2) (13, 15) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 15) (7, 5) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 5) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:
Since there are 20 nodes in total, each forming a 3-star with a center, there are 20 possible 3-stars in total.
Now, let's go through the list of edges to identify the unique 3-stars:

1. (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 16) <11, (1, 9, 16)>
2. (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 7) <6, (2, 18, 7)>
3. (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 0) <9, (11, 10, 0)>
4. (2, 6) (2, 16) (16, 4) <2, (6, 16, 4)>
5. (6, 12) (12, 1) (12, 5) <6, (12, 1, 5)>
6. (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 14) <4, (1, 8, 14)>
7. (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 9) <0, (1, 10, 9)>
8. (13, 2) (13, 15) (15, 14) <13, (2, 15, 14)>
9. (18, 1) (18, 2) (1, 11) <18, (1, 2, 11)>
10. (19, 7) (19, 15) (15, 14) <19, (7, 15, 14)>
  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
