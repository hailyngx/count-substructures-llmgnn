Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central nodes and their adjacent nodes. 

Let's go through each node in the graph and identify any 3-stars:
- Node 0: No 3-star (degree = 2)
- Node 1: No 3-star (degree = 4)
- Node 2: No 3-star (degree = 6)
- Node 3: No 3-star (degree = 5)
- Node 4: No 3-star (degree = 5)
- Node 5: <5, (2, 9, 13)> (3-star found)
- Node 6: No 3-star (degree = 3)
- Node 7: No 3-star (degree = 4)
- Node 8: No 3-star (degree = 2)
- Node 9: <9, (5, 12, 13)> (3-star found)
- Node 10: No 3-star (degree = 4)
- Node 11: No 3-star (degree = 6)
- Node 12: No 3-star (degree = 5)
- Node 13: No 3-star (degree = 4)
- Node 14: No 3-star (degree = 4)

Number of 3-stars: [2]
Unique 3-stars: <<5, (2, 9, 13)>, <9, (5, 12, 13)>]
