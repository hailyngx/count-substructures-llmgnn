Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 6) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node to see how many 3-star configurations it is part of.

Let's go through the nodes one by one:
- Node 0 is part of one 3-star: <0, (12, 13, 14)>
- Node 1 is part of one 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 11)>
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 3 is part of three 3-stars: <3, (10, 7, 14)>, <3, (4, 10, 12)>, <3, (7, 10, 12)>
- Node 4 is part of one 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 13)>
- Node 5 is not part of any 3-star.
- Node 6 is part of two 3-stars: <6, (1, 11, 14)>, <6, (2, 4, 13)>
- Node 7 is part of two 3-stars: <7, (3, 10, 12)>, <7, (9, 10, 12)>
- Node 8 is part of one 3-star: <8, (1, 9, 13)>
- Node 9 is part of two 3-stars: <9, (7, 14, 13)>, <9, (0, 8, 14)>
- Node 10 is part of two 3-stars: <10, (3, 7, 12)>, <10, (2, 5, 11)>
- Node 11 is part of two 3-stars: <11, (1, 6, 14)>, <11, (5, 10, 14)>
- Node 12 is part of one 3-star: <12, (0, 7, 13)>
- Node 13 is part of two 3-stars: <13, (4, 6, 2)>, <13, (0, 8, 12)>
- Node 14 is part of two 3-stars: <14, (3, 7, 9)>, <14, (0, 9, 11)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [16]. 
The unique 3-stars are <0, (12, 13, 14)>, <1, (5, 6, 11)>, <3, (10, 7, 14)>, <3, (4, 10, 12)>, <3, (7, 10, 12)>, <4, (2, 6, 13)>, <6, (1, 11, 14)>, <6, (2, 4, 13)>, <7, (3, 10, 12)>, <7, (9, 10, 12)>, <8, (1, 9, 13)>, <9, (7, 14, 13)>, <9, (0, 8, 14)>, <10, (3, 7, 12)>, <10, (2, 5, 11)>, <11, (1, 6, 14)>, <11, (5, 10, 14)>, <12, (0, 7, 13)>, <13, (4, 6, 2)>, <13, (0, 8, 12)>, <14, (3, 7, 9)>, <14, (0, 9, 11)>.
