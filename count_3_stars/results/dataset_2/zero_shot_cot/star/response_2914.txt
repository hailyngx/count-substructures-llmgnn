Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 17) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 7) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (18, 9) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 0) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 16) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 14) (14, 6) (14, 16) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 2) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 19) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<1, (15, 18, 7)>
<5, (19, 0, 15)>
<6, (4, 14, 16)>
<8, (13, 0, 7)>
<10, (13, 11, 16)>
<12, (11, 9, 17)>
<14, (6, 16, 4)>
<15, (1, 19, 17)>
<18, (9, 17, 1)>
<19, (15, 5, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
