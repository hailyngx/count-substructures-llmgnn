Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 14) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must have degree 3. 
From the given edges, we can identify the central nodes and find the corresponding leaves of each 3-star:

1. (8, 13, 5, 2) - With central node 8 and leaves 13, 5, 2.
2. (13, 10, 11, 5) - With central node 13 and leaves 10, 11, 5.
3. (10, 4, 11, 9) - With central node 10 and leaves 4, 11, 9.
4. (11, 1, 6, 4) - With central node 11 and leaves 1, 6, 4.
5. (4, 8, 10, 6) - With central node 4 and leaves 8, 10, 6.
6. (6, 13, 14, 0) - With central node 6 and leaves 13, 14, 0.
7. (1, 2, 5, 11) - With central node 1 and leaves 2, 5, 11.
8. (9, 13, 10, 0) - With central node 9 and leaves 13, 10, 0.

Therefore, there are a total of <8, (13, 5, 2)> <13, (10, 11, 5)> <10, (4, 11, 9)> <11, (1, 6, 4)> <4, (8, 10, 6)> <6, (13, 14, 0)> <1, (2, 5, 11)> <9, (13, 10, 0)> 3-stars in the graph.

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the graph.
