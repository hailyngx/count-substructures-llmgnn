Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 9) (16, 6) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 13) (7, 12) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 15) (5, 11) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (13, 18) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 9) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 13) (19, 18) (19, 13) (15, 12) (15, 14) (14, 2) (14, 15) (6, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (9, 16) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph.

Starting with node 1 as the center, the 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 11, 0)>

Moving on to node 2 as the center, the 3-star is:
<2, (12, 10, 14)>

The total count of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
