Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes (forming a 3-star pattern).

There are a few 3-stars in this graph:
<5, (6, 8, 3)>
<9, (2, 1, 0)>
<4, (8, 0, 3)>
<8, (5, 4, 2)>
<6, (5, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 8, 7)>
<1, (9, 2, 0)>
<3, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
<0, (9, 4, 1)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
