Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 15) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 18) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 15) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 18) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 1) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 14) (6, 10) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 16) (17, 19) (11, 13) (11, 15) (14, 8) (14, 3) (16, 10) (16, 17) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (19, 4) (19, 9) (19, 17) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 11) 

Response:
The central nodes with exactly three neighbors could form 3-stars. Let's identify all 3-stars in this graph:

<1, (4, 2, 5)>
<3, (8, 10, 14)>
<6, (10, 17, 0)>
<7, (4, 9, 19)>

There are a total of [4] 3-stars in the graph.
