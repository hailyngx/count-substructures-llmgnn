Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 2) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (7, 12, 0)>
<5, (8, 14, 4)>
<7, (4, 12, 0)>
<8, (5, 14, 11)>
<9, (7, 6, 3)>
<10, (6, 11, 0)>
<11, (8, 10, 3)>
<12, (4, 7, 0)>
<13, (8, 1, 3)>
<14, (4, 6, 8)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10].
