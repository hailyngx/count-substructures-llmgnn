Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <5, (6, 8, 1)>
2. <9, (4, 2, 1)>
3. <1, (5, 9, 3)>
4. <1, (9, 4, 8)>
5. <1, (3, 4, 8)>
6. <4, (9, 1, 3)>
7. <4, (1, 3, 8)>
8. <8, (5, 1, 4)>
9. <8, (1, 4, 2)>
10. <6, (5, 4, 7)>
11. <6, (4, 7, 0)>
12. <2, (9, 8, 7)>
13. <0, (4, 6, 7)>
14. <7, (9, 1, 6)>
15. <7, (1, 6, 0)>

As we can see, there are 15 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
