Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 1.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 0.

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- For node 0, we have a 3-star <0, (9, 2, 1)>.
- For node 1, we have a 3-star <1, (4, 7, 6)>.
- For node 3, we have a 3-star <3, (9, 4, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
