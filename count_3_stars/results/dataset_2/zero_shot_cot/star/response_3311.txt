Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 15) (4, 17) (8, 11) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 13) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 15) (1, 5) (1, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 12) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 13) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 17) (19, 9) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (16, 10) (16, 17) (17, 4) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 17) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 17) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars we find:

<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<2, (13, 15, 18)>
<3, (6, 12, 14)>
<4, (15, 17, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 17)>
<6, (3, 7, 12)>
<7, (6, 8, 11)>
<9, (0, 14, 19)>
<10, (12, 16, 17)>
<11, (7, 8, 12)>
<13, (2, 12, 14)>
<14, (3, 9, 13)>
<15, (2, 4, 7)>
<16, (10, 17, 12)>
<17, (4, 5, 16)>
<18, (2, 15, 13)>
<19, (9)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars:
