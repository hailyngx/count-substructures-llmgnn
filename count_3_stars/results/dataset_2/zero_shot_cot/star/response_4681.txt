Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars we first look for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. These nodes could be potential centers of 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can see that node 5, node 6, and node 8 have exactly three neighbors each. Let's examine the possible 3-stars for each of these potential central nodes:

For node 5:
- <5, (9, 6, 8)>
- <5, (9, 6, 7)>
- <5, (9, 6, 5)>
- <5, (9, 8, 7)>
- <5, (7, 6, 8)>

For node 6:
- <6, (5, 9, 8)>
- <6, (5, 9, 3)>
- <6, (5, 9, 2)>
- <6, (5, 9, 6)>
- <6, (3, 1, 8)>
- <6, (3, 1, 0)>
- <6, (3, 8, 0)>
- <6, (3, 8, 6)>
- <6, (8, 4, 0)>
- <6, (8, 4, 2)>
- <6, (8, 0, 3)>

For node 8:
- <8, (5, 9, 6)>
- <8, (5, 9, 3)>
- <8, (5, 9, 4)>
- <8, (5, 9, 2)>
- <8, (9, 4, 2)>
- <8, (9, 4, 8)>
- <8, (9, 2, 0)>
- <8, (9, 6, 5)>
- <8, (0, 6, 3)>
- <8, (0, 6, 2)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars gives us 14. 
Therefore, the final answer is [14].
