Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 3) (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 12) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 6) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 2) (1, 9) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 9) (18, 22) (18, 19) (4, 13) (4, 8) (4, 23) (4, 14) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 20) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 12) (14, 11) (14, 4) (5, 26) (5, 23) (19, 18) (19, 25) (19, 28) (19, 23) (20, 2) (20, 29) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 23) (29, 1) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 15) (25, 19) (25, 15) (10, 21) (10, 26) (26, 5) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 27) (6, 16) (6, 29) (6, 17) (17, 6) (17, 27) (23, 4) (23, 5) (23, 19) (23, 20) (23, 24) (12, 11) (12, 0) (15, 29) (15, 25) (15, 26) (15, 24) (28, 22) (28, 0) (28, 19) (9, 1) (9, 21) (9, 20) (9, 24) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 17) (3, 22) (3, 20) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 15) (24, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the nodes that have exactly three neighbors. 

The nodes with three neighbors in the given graph are:
- Node 22 (neighbors: 13, 18, 28)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 13, 8, 23)
- Node 16 (neighbors: 11, 0, 6)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 21, 29, 2)
- Node 21 (neighbors: 1, 10, 27)
- Node 29 (neighbors: 1, 20, 6)
- Node 20 (neighbors: 2, 29, 3)
- Node 19 (neighbors: 18, 25, 28)
- Node 26 (neighbors: 5, 10, 15)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 16, 29, 17)
- Node 17 (neighbors: 6, 27, 14)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

Total number of 3-stars: [11]

Unique 3-stars:
<22, (13, 18, 28)>
<4, (13, 8, 23)>
<16, (11, 0, 6)>
<1, (21, 29, 2)>
<21, (1, 10, 27)>
<29, (1, 20, 6)>
<20, (2, 29, 3)>
<19, (18, 25, 28)>
<26, (5, 10, 15)>
<6, (16, 29, 17)>
<17, (6, 27, 14)>
