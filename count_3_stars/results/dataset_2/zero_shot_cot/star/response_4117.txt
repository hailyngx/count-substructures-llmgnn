Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 27) (13, 22) (13, 3) (13, 9) (22, 11) (22, 13) (22, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 15) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 18) (21, 7) (21, 10) (23, 20) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 25) (3, 20) (3, 4) (25, 3) (25, 27) (1, 6) (1, 5) (26, 11) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 29) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 20) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 15) (24, 26) (24, 19) (24, 10) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 6) (19, 14) (19, 24) (19, 8) (19, 9) (27, 16) (27, 25) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 29) (5, 1) (5, 26) (5, 2) (0, 2) (10, 21) (10, 24) (28, 8) (28, 9) (2, 16) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 28) (9, 2) (20, 23) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 12) (12, 20) (15, 17) (15, 18) (15, 8) (29, 26) (29, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 22, and 26.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 17, and 27.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 25.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 3, and 18.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 14, 19, and 15.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 14, 24, and 9.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 11, 24, and 5.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 1, and 29.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 26, and 2.

Next, let's list down all unique 3-stars in the graph:
<11, (16, 22, 26)>
<16, (11, 17, 27)>
<22, (11, 13, 7)>
<3, (13, 14, 25)>
<4, (11, 3, 18)>
<8, (14, 19, 15)>
<19, (14, 24, 9)>
<26, (11, 24, 5)>
<6, (14, 1, 29)>
<5, (1, 26, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars gives us a total of [10].
