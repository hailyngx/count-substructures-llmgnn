Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 12) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 4) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 10) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graphs in the given graph:

1. <5, (9, 11, 13)>
2. <9, (5, 10, 11)>
3. <0, (10, 11, 3)>
4. <14, (6, 7, 13)>
5. <2, (1, 10, 0)>
6. <8, (0, 6, 12)>
7. <13, (5, 12, 14)>
8. <3, (0, 11, 6)>
9. <11, (5, 9, 0)>
10. <4, (14, 3, 6)>
11. <12, (9, 8, 13)>
12. <10, (5, 9, 0)>
13. <1, (0, 11, 2)>
14. <6, (14, 8, 3)>
15. <7, (5, 9, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [15] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
