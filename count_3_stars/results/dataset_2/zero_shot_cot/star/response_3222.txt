Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 9) (6, 14) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 13: <4, (7, 8, 13)>
2. Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 14: <7, (4, 6, 14)>
3. Node 13 can form a 3-star with nodes 1, 10, and 11: <13, (1, 10, 11)>
4. Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes 7, 3, and 14: <6, (7, 3, 14)>
5. Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 1, and 12: <8, (4, 1, 12)>
6. Node 5 can form a 3-star with nodes 10, 11, and 13: <5, (10, 11, 13)>
7. Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 0, 6, and 2: <3, (0, 6, 2)>
8. Node 12 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 11, and 14: <12, (3, 11, 14)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
