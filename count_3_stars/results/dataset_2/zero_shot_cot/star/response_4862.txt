Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given edges, the possibilities are nodes 0, 1, and 6. 

- For node 0: (0, 6), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 2), (0, 5)
- For node 1: (1, 6), (1, 2), (1, 9)
- For node 6: (6, 1), (6, 8), (6, 0)

Next, we identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <0, (6, 9, 8)>
2. <1, (6, 2, 9)>
3. <6, (1, 8, 0)>

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
