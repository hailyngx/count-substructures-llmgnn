Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 8) (13, 21) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 28) (22, 15) (15, 22) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 26) (27, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 23) (3, 6) (3, 19) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 12) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 4) (18, 20) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 29) (19, 14) (26, 27) (26, 19) (26, 20) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 0) (17, 9) (17, 21) (17, 7) (4, 2) (4, 25) (4, 6) (12, 8) (12, 18) (12, 25) (16, 21) (16, 24) (21, 13) (21, 17) (21, 16) (21, 29) (29, 19) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 7) (29, 11) (24, 16) (7, 5) (7, 17) (7, 29) (7, 14) (20, 2) (20, 18) (20, 26) (0, 1) (0, 11) (25, 8) (25, 1) (25, 4) (25, 12) (6, 27) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 11) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 23) (23, 9) (23, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 0) (11, 6) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 7) (14, 28) 

Response:
The total number of nodes in the graph is 30. Since each of the 30 nodes can potentially be the center of a 3-star, we will count all possible 3-stars and then eliminate duplicates.

There are a total of 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Now, we will count the instances of each unique 3-star.

Count of each 3-star:
- <13, (22, 8, 21)>: 2 occurrences
- <22, (13, 28, 15)>: 1 occurrence
- <15, (22, 27, 7)>: 1 occurrence
- <5, (8, 7, 14)>: 1 occurrence
- <9, (2, 17, 23)>: 1 occurrence
- <3, (6, 19, 4)>: 1 occurrence
- <18, (20, 12, 25)>: 1 occurrence
- <1, (29, 0, 25)>: 1 occurrence

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
