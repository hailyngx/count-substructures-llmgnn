Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 12) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 1) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:
1. First, find the degree of each node:
- Node 0 has degree 6
- Node 1 has degree 3
- Node 2 has degree 5
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 4
- Node 5 has degree 5
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 7 has degree 3
- Node 8 has degree 3
- Node 9 has degree 3
- Node 10 has degree 5
- Node 11 has degree 2
- Node 12 has degree 6
- Node 13 has degree 4
- Node 14 has degree 3

2. The number of 3-stars in the graph is given by the formula: sum(degree^2) - 2 * number of triangles.

3. Calculate the sum of the squares of the degrees:
6^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 5^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + 2^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 = 194

4. Calculate the number of triangles:
Since triangles are formed by cycles of length 3,
Number of triangles = 1/6 * sum(triangle's degree product)
= 1/6 * (6*3*9 + 3*4*9 + 4*5*9 + 5*5*3 + 3*3*6) = 107

5. Substitute the values into the formula to find the number of 3-stars:
194 - 2 * 107 = 194 - 214 = -20

Therefore, there are -20 3-stars in the graph.
