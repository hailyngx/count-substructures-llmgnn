Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 10) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes with exactly three neighbors to check for 3-stars. 

From the given edges, the nodes with exactly three neighbors are:
- Node 5 (Neighbors: 9, 13, 12)
- Node 9 (Neighbors: 5, 6, 8)
- Node 4 (Neighbors: 7, 12, 0)
- Node 7 (Neighbors: 5, 4, 10)
- Node 13 (Neighbors: 5, 9, 3)
- Node 12 (Neighbors: 5, 9, 4)
- Node 0 (Neighbors: 4, 1, 8)
- Node 10 (Neighbors: 7, 5, 2)
- Node 14 (Neighbors: 6, 13, 12)
- Node 2 (Neighbors: 8, 10, 11)
- Node 8 (Neighbors: 9, 7, 2)
- Node 6 (Neighbors: 9, 14, 13)
- Node 1 (Neighbors: 0, 12)
- Node 3 (Neighbors: 13)
- Node 11 (Neighbors: 2, 13)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
<5, (9, 13, 12)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (7, 12, 0)>
<7, (5, 4, 10)>
<13, (5, 9, 3)>
<12, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (4, 1, 8)>
<10, (7, 5, 2)>
<14, (6, 13, 12)>
<2, (8, 10, 11)>
<8, (9, 7, 2)>
<6, (9, 14, 13)>
