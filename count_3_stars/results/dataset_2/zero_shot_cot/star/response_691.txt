Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 19) (6, 7) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 15) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 12) (10, 18) (10, 1) (15, 13) (15, 18) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 4) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 2) (12, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 12) (18, 11) (18, 10) (18, 15) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 17) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's determine which nodes have exactly three connections:
- Node 0: Connected to nodes 14, 16, and 3
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 14, 10, and 12
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 3, 11, and 15
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 5, 19, and 16
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 6, 3, and 8
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 11, 10, and 15

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- There are 6 different 3-stars in the given graph.

So, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
- <0, (14, 16, 3)>
- <1, (14, 10, 12)>
- <2, (3, 11, 15)>
- <4, (5, 19, 16)>
- <7, (6, 3, 8)>
- <18, (11, 10, 15)>
