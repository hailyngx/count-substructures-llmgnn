Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (0, 17) (0, 4) (0, 2) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 19) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 19) (19, 8) (19, 9) (19, 11) (19, 16) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 13) (4, 11) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 4) (16, 12) (16, 19) (16, 6) (16, 10) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 15) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 18) (10, 16) (10, 2) (18, 12) (18, 6) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 15) (15, 2) (15, 17) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by examining the nodes that are directly connected to each node. Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to 3 other nodes, we need to find nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes.

Checking each node, we find the following 3-stars:
<0, (4, 2, 17)>
<1, (5, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 13, 0)>
<3, (1, 9, 8)>
<4, (12, 0, 13)>
<5, (1, 14, 3)>
<6, (7, 16, 18)>
<7, (12, 11, 6)>
<8, (3, 19, 9)>
<9, (3, 17, 19)>
<10, (16, 2, 15)>
<11, (7, 19, 4)>
<12, (7, 4, 16)>
<13, (2, 4, 0)>
<14, (5, 1, 3)>
<15, (17, 2, 15)>
<16, (12, 6, 10)>
<17, (0, 9, 15)>
<18, (6, 16, 12)>
<19, (8, 11, 16)>

There are 20 distinct 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [20].
