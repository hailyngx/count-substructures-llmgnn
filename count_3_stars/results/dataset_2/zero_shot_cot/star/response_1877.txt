Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 14) (3, 12) (15, 18) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (2, 7) (2, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 17) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 19) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 18) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 5) (18, 16) (17, 5) (17, 19) (19, 13) (19, 17) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are directly connected to each node. Here is the list of nodes directly connected to each node:

Node 0: 1, 6, 12, 14
Node 1: 0, 5, 9, 11
Node 2: 7, 12
Node 3: 12, 14
Node 4: 7, 12, 16
Node 5: 1, 13, 17, 18
Node 6: 0, 7
Node 7: 2, 4, 6
Node 9: 1, 10, 11, 14
Node 10: 9, 11, 18
Node 11: 1, 9, 10, 13, 14
Node 12: 0, 2, 3, 4
Node 13: 5, 11, 19
Node 14: 0, 3, 9, 11
Node 15: 16, 18
Node 16: 4, 15, 18
Node 17: 5, 19
Node 18: 5, 10, 15, 16
Node 19: 13, 17

Next, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (1, 6, 12)>
<0, (1, 12, 14)>
<0, (6, 7, 12)>
<0, (14, 9, 11)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 13, 17)>
<1, (9, 10, 11)>
<2, (7, 4, 12)>
<4, (7, 6, 16)>
<4, (12, 2, 0)>
<5, (1, 13, 17)>
<5, (13, 11, 19)>
<5, (18, 16, 15)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<9, (1, 11, 14)>
<9, (10, 18, 11)>
<10, (9, 11, 18)>
<11, (9, 1, 10)>
<12, (0, 2, 3)>
<12, (4, 2, 16)>
<13, (5, 11, 19)>
<14, (0, 9, 11)>
<15, (16, 18, 5)>
<16, (4, 12, 18)>
<17, (5, 13, 19)>
<18, (16, 10, 15)>

There are a total of [26] unique 3-stars in the graph.
