Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 10) (26, 14) (5, 9) (5, 28) (5, 20) (14, 26) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 15) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 6) (17, 21) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 8) (21, 17) (21, 7) (21, 23) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 28) (7, 23) (7, 13) (29, 17) (29, 8) (29, 3) (19, 7) (19, 25) (10, 26) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 28) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (25, 17) (25, 1) (25, 19) (27, 9) (3, 29) (3, 28) (28, 5) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 3) (28, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 4) (2, 20) (12, 10) (12, 0) (6, 17) (6, 0) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 23) (24, 16) (24, 4) (13, 7) (13, 28) (13, 16) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 6) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 8) (8, 1) (8, 29) (8, 18) (4, 11) (4, 24) (4, 20) (23, 1) (23, 21) (23, 7) (23, 16) (20, 5) (20, 2) (20, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that have exactly three incident edges, which form 3-stars around those nodes.

By examining the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<9, (26, 5, 11)>
<26, (9, 14, 10)>
<5, (9, 28, 20)>
<14, (26, 11, 15)>
<17, (29, 25, 6)>
<1, (25, 23, 8)>
<21, (17, 7, 23)>
<7, (21, 28, 13)>
<29, (17, 8, 3)>
<10, (26, 15, 12)>
<15, (14, 10, 0)>
<25, (17, 1, 19)>
<28, (5, 7, 3)>
<11, (9, 14, 18)>
<12, (10, 0, 6)>
<24, (16, 4, 13)>
<13, (7, 28, 16)>
<0, (15, 12, 6)>
<18, (14, 15, 11)>
<8, (1, 29, 18)>
<4, (11, 24, 20)>
<23, (1, 21, 7)>
<20, (5, 2, 4)>

There are 23 unique 3-stars found.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
