Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 15) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 2) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 18) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 17) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 15) (8, 19) (8, 9) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 16) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 15) (18, 5) (18, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (16, 7) (16, 10) (16, 9) (16, 14) (15, 7) (15, 19) (15, 12) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 16) (0, 11) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected as leaves to the center node in each 3-star.

From the given edges, we can see the following connections between nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to node 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8 and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 11, 17, and 17.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 12, 9, and 14.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 19, 18, and 13.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 16, 3, 15, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 19.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 16.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 2, and 16.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 10, 3, and 0.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 17, and 15.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 5, 17, and 2.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 18, and 16.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 19, and 12.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 9, and 14.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 13, 3, and 12.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 5 and 14.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 15.

Now, we can find the 3-stars in the graph. 

There are <4, (7, 9, 14)>, <7, (4, 3, 15)>, and <16, (7, 9, 14)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
