Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 5: <5, (9, 12, 3)>
- Node 9: <9, (5, 14, 1)>
- Node 10: <10, (5, 11, 8)>
- Node 11: <11, (10, 7, 4)>
- Node 7: <7, (10, 11, 12)>
- Node 12: <12, (5, 7, 2)>
- Node 2: <2, (7, 12, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (10, 2, 3)>
- Node 14: <14, (5, 9, 11)>
- Node 3: <3, (5, 7, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (12, 3, 4)>
- Node 1: <1, (9, 7, 2)>
- Node 13: <13, (12, 14, 0)>
- Node 0: <0, (13)>

Total number of 3-stars: [14]
