Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 0) (16, 18) (16, 9) (16, 10) (1, 21) (1, 0) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 9) (21, 12) (6, 17) (6, 25) (9, 16) (9, 21) (9, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 25) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (4, 12) (4, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (20, 29) (20, 3) (2, 8) (2, 28) (2, 25) (19, 13) (19, 26) (19, 23) (26, 19) (26, 7) (26, 17) (17, 6) (17, 26) (17, 29) (17, 22) (29, 20) (29, 17) (29, 27) (29, 12) (28, 11) (28, 2) (28, 5) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 26) (7, 25) (7, 23) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 2) (25, 7) (10, 16) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 24) (27, 29) (27, 3) (12, 21) (12, 4) (12, 29) (12, 18) (3, 20) (3, 27) (3, 14) (3, 22) (5, 15) (5, 28) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 24) (0, 11) (0, 1) (24, 10) (24, 14) (24, 22) (18, 16) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 12) (22, 17) (22, 3) (22, 24) (23, 19) (23, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern where the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
   - Node 18 has edges with nodes 16, 4, and 12.
   - Node 10 has edges with nodes 16, 15, and 24.
   - Node 12 has edges with nodes 21, 4, and 29.

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
   - <18, (16, 4, 12)>
   - <10, (16, 15, 24)>
   - <12, (21, 4, 29)>

3. Count the number of unique 3-stars: [3]
