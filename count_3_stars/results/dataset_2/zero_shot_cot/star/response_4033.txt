Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 13) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 28) (29, 24) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 26) (25, 3) (25, 16) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 14) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 27) (23, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 2) (13, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 11) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 0) (18, 19) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 21) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 1) (9, 22) (9, 14) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 28) (11, 14) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 0) (20, 3) (20, 18) (20, 17) (20, 12) (21, 18) (26, 3) (26, 23) (7, 19) (10, 14) (19, 18) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 1) (19, 27) (14, 22) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 10) (15, 19) (15, 12) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 17) (16, 25) (16, 4) (16, 5) (16, 17) (12, 23) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 15) (27, 23) (27, 19) (24, 29) (24, 5) (24, 18) (1, 28) (1, 19) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

1. From the provided edges, we identify the nodes that are connected to node 2: nodes 29, 13, 17. This forms a valid 3-star with node 2 as the center. 
So, we have found the 3-star <2, (29, 13, 17)>.

2. Next, let's identify the 3-star patterns around other nodes by checking the connections:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 11, 0.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 3, 16, (no more unique connection).
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 23, 9, 14.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 22, 26, 27.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 4, (no more unique connection).
- Node 13 is already accounted for in the first 3-star found.
- Node 4 is already accounted for in the first 3-star found.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 24.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 0, (no more unique connection).
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 19, 20, 24.
- Node 28 is already accounted for in the first 3-star found.
- Node 9 is already accounted for in the 3-star around node 22.
- Node 11 is already accounted for in the first 3-star found.
- Node 17 is already accounted for in the first 3-star found.
- Node 20 is already accounted for in the 3-star around node 3.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 18, (no more unique connection).
- Node 26 is already accounted for in the 3-star around node 23.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 19, (no more unique connection).
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 14, (no more unique connection).
- Node 19 is already accounted for in connections around other nodes.
- Node 14 is already accounted for in the 3-star around node 22.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 19, 12, (no more unique connection).
- Node 0 is already accounted for in connections around other nodes.
- Node 16 is already accounted for in the 3-star around node 3.
- Node 12 is already accounted for in connections around other nodes.
- Node 27 is already accounted for in the 3-star around node 23.
- Node 24 is already accounted for in connections around other nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 28, 19.

Based on the above analysis, there is only one unique 3-star in the given graph.
Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [1]. The unique 3-star found is <2, (29, 13, 17)>.
