Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which will form the leaves of a 3-star graph. Nodes with degree 3 fit this criteria, denoted as (node, ...).

The nodes with degree 3 are: (5, 4, 7, 0)

Next, we check if these nodes satisfy the 3-star graph condition by ensuring that they are connected to a common node (center) and not directly connected to each other. This common node will be the center of the 3-star graph.

1. For node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7) 
   <5, (9, 2, 4)>
   
2. For node 4: (4, 5), (4, 3)
   <4, (5, 3, 7)>
   
3. For node 7: (7, 5), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 2), (7, 0) 
   <7, (5, 3, 8)>
   
4. For node 0: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 7)
   <0, (1, 3, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [4]
Unique 3-stars: <<5, (9, 2, 4)>, <4, (5, 3, 7)>, <7, (5, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>]
