Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly 3 other nodes, forming a star-like structure.

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<4, (7, 6, 2)>
<7, (4, 3, 9)>
<1, (7, 9, 0)>
<3, (7, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<9, (7, 1, 3)>
<8, (4, 6, 2)>
<5, (3, 6, 2)>
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 5, 1)>

Count of 3-stars: [10]
