Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 18) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 19) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 4) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 10) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 5) (10, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be found by counting the number of nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go through the steps:

Step 1: Identify the nodes that satisfy the definition of a 3-star graph. 
From the given edges, we can determine the nodes and their connections:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 16, 18, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 18.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 13, 17, and 10.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 11, and 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 11.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 0, 16, and 17.

Step 2: Count the unique 3-stars. 
From the identified nodes, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (16, 18, 8)>
<3, (6, 19, 18)>
<5, (13, 17, 10)>
<7, (0, 11, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 11)>
<15, (0, 16, 17)>

Step 3: Calculate the total number of unique 3-stars.
The total number of unique 3-stars is 6.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
