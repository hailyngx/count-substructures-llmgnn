Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 15) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 13) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 9) (12, 2) (12, 7) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 15) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 6) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 4) (13, 18) (13, 0) (5, 4) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the nodes connected to it in a star pattern. 

First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 17, 18, 12, 19, and 14.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 17, 11, 14, and 4.

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 8, 0)>
<3, (1, 17, 4)>
<17, (3, 10, 8)>
<10, (17, 6, 9)>
<2, (17, 18, 12)>
<11, (7, 19, 15)>
<6, (10, 16, 14)>
<14, (2, 6, 15)>
<4, (3, 9, 5)>
<9, (10, 7, 4)>
<0, (1, 16, 13)>
<18, (2, 13, 0)>
<5, (4)>
<13, (18, 0)>
<19, (2, 11)>
<7, (12, 11, 9)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [16]
