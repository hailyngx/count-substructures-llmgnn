Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, identify the nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. These nodes can be the centers of 3-stars in the graph. 

Nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: 13, 5, 12, 3, 11, 4, 1, 10, 2

Next, count the number of 3-stars by considering each of these nodes as the center. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 13: <13, (3, 5, 1)>
- For node 5: <5, (4, 6, 12)>
- For node 12: <12, (2, 4, 10)>
- For node 3: <3, (6, 11, 9)>
- For node 11: <11, (4, 1, 3)>
- For node 4: <4, (5, 1, 11)>
- For node 1: <1, (13, 9, 11)>
- For node 10: <10, (5, 3, 12)>
- For node 2: <2, (5, 12, 14)>

Counting all these unique 3-stars, we find that there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
