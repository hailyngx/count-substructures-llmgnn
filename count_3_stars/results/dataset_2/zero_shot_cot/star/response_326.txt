Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

- Node 4 forms a 3-star: <4, (7, 6, 3)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star: <7, (4, 9, 5)>
- Node 6 forms a 3-star: <6, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star: <5, (7, 6, 1)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star: <2, (8, 9, 3)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star: <8, (6, 2, 1)>
- Node 0 forms a 3-star: <0, (5, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star: <9, (4, 7, 2)>
- Node 1 forms a 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 3 forms a 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 2)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [10].
