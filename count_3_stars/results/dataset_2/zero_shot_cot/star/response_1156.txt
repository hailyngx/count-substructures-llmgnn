Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's determine the 3-stars in the given graph.

We can identify 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. This means we are looking for nodes that have 3 neighbors connected to them.

After analyzing the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <4, (7, 0, 5)>
2. <7, (4, 0, 2)>
3. <6, (9, 5, 1)>
4. <9, (4, 6, 8)>
5. <5, (4, 6, 2)>
6. <0, (4, 7, 9)>
7. <8, (7, 6, 9)>
8. <1, (4, 6, 0)>
9. <2, (7, 5, 0)>
10. <3, (9, 5, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
