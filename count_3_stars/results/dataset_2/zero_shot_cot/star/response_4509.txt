Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 18) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 19) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (14, 15) (14, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to the center node to form 3-stars. We look for nodes with exactly 3 edges incident on them:
Nodes with 3 incident edges: 2, 4, 7, 13, 15, 16, 17

Now, we will find the 3-stars:
- For node 2: (2, 6, 1) (2, 6, 4) (2, 6, 19)
- For node 4: (4, 16, 2) (4, 16, 6)
- For node 7: (7, 3, 13) (7, 3, 16) (7, 13, 1)
- For node 13: (13, 7, 3) (13, 7, 0) (13, 7, 1)
- For node 15: (15, 3, 7) (15, 3, 14) (15, 3, 10)
- For node 16: (16, 7, 13) (16, 7, 4)
- For node 17: (17, 13, 11) (17, 13, 1) (17, 13, 12)

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get:
