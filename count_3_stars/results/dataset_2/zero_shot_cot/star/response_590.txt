Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (18, 10) (18, 15) (19, 13) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 18) (3, 0) (17, 4) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 16) (8, 5) (8, 11) (16, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 13) (9, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 6) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 15) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 11) 

Response:
Let's first identify all 3-stars in the given graph:

- <4, (7, 10, 14)>
- <7, (4, 5, 12)>
- <12, (7, 1, 6)>
- <0, (10, 3, 11)>
- <14, (4, 15, 13)>
- <18, (10, 15, 19)>
- <19, (13, 18, 0)>
- <3, (0, 11, 4)>
- <17, (4, 12, 16)>
- <5, (7, 1, 16)>
- <8, (5, 11, 1)>
- <16, (17, 5, 6)>
- <2, (17, 13, 4)>
- <9, (13, 2, 15)>
- <1, (4, 12, 5)>
- <11, (0, 8, 6)>
- <13, (14, 19, 2)>
- <15, (18, 13, 14)>
- <6, (12, 16, 11)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in total, so the answer is [19].
