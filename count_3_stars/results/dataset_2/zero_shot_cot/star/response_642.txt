Response:
There are several 3-stars in the given graph. Let's identify them step by step:

1. Node 13 is the center of 3-star with leaves (22, 4, 14)
2. Node 22 is the center of 3-star with leaves (13, 26, 5)
3. Node 3 is the center of 3-star with leaves (15, 14, 2)
4. Node 5 is the center of 3-star with leaves (22, 28, 7)
5. Node 9 is the center of 3-star with leaves (21, 11, 0)
6. Node 28 is the center of 3-star with leaves (5, 18, 21)
7. Node 29 is the center of 3-star with leaves (6, 14, 24)
8. Node 2 is the center of 3-star with leaves (3, 8, 23)
9. Node 8 is the center of 3-star with leaves (2, 26, 10)
10. Node 6 is the center of 3-star with leaves (29, 19, 4)
11. Node 26 is the center of 3-star with leaves (22, 8, 14)
12. Node 18 is the center of 3-star with leaves (28, 21, 7)
13. Node 19 is the center of 3-star with leaves (6, 7, 17)
14. Node 14 is part of two 3-stars: (13, 3, 29) and (26, 4, 14)
15. Node 4 is part of two 3-stars: (13, 22, 4) and (6, 12, 4)
16. Node 12 is part of two 3-stars: (4, 24, 12) and (4, 25, 12)
17. Node 17 is part of two 3-stars: (19, 6, 17) and (26, 17, 23)
18. Node 25 is part of two 3-stars: (12, 27, 25) and (0, 25, 23)
19. Node 27 is part of two 3-stars: (13, 25, 27) and (10, 27, 20)
20. Node 7 is part of two 3-stars: (22, 5, 7) and (7, 19, 20)
21. Node 11 is part of two 3-stars: (15, 9, 11) and (0, 11, 21)
22. Node 0 is part of two 3-stars: (25, 11, 0) and (21, 0, 23)
23. Node 1 is part of two 3-stars: (4, 1, 16) and (1, 23, 0)
24. Node 16 is part of a 3-star with center 1 and leaves (1, 16, 23)
25. Node 10 is part of a 3-star with center 27 and leaves (8, 10, 27)
26. Node 20 is part of a 3-star with center 27 and leaves (7, 20, 27)
27. Node 21 is part of a 3-star with center 18 and leaves (9, 21, 18)
28. Node 23 is part of a 3-star with center 1 and leaves (2, 23, 1)

Therefore, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.
