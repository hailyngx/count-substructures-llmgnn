Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 14) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central nodes connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:

1. Node 5 has three neighbors: 4, 3, and 10, forming a 3-star.
   <5, (4, 3, 10)>

2. Node 9 has four neighbors, but only 6, 14, and 3 are connected to it, forming a 3-star.
   <9, (6, 14, 3)>

3. Node 10 has three neighbors: 5, 11, and 14, forming a 3-star.
   <10, (5, 11, 14)>

4. Node 13 has four neighbors, but only 8, 14, and 7 are connected to it, forming a 3-star.
   <13, (8, 14, 7)>

5. Node 4 has four neighbors, but only 5, 11, and 8 are connected to it, forming a 3-star.
   <4, (5, 11, 8)>

6. Node 7 has four neighbors, but only 6, 13, and 12 are connected to it, forming a 3-star.
   <7, (6, 13, 12)>

7. Node 12 has five neighbors, but only 9, 11, and 7 are connected to it, forming a 3-star.
   <12, (9, 11, 7)>

8. Node 14 has four neighbors, but only 9, 10, and 13 are connected to it, forming a 3-star.
   <14, (9, 10, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
