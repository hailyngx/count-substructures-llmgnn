Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes in the graph. From the list of edges, we can see that nodes 5, 9, 4, 7, and 10 each have exactly 3 edges connected to them, making them potential central nodes.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph.

For node 5:
- <5, (9, 4, 0)>
- <5, (9, 4, 11)>
- <5, (9, 4, 10)>

For node 9:
- <9, (5, 4, 10)>

For node 4:
- <4, (5, 9, 11)>
- <4, (5, 9, 2)>
- <4, (5, 7, 12)>
- <4, (9, 2, 7)>
- <4, (7, 2, 12)>
- <4, (11, 13, 1)>

For node 7:
- <7, (4, 2, 10)>
- <7, (2, 8, 14)>

For node 10:
- <10, (5, 9, 7)>
- <10, (3, 14, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
