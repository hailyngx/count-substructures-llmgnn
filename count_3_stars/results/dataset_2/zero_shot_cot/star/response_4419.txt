Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (19, 12) (19, 9) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 12) (12, 19) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (18, 10) (0, 10) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 16) (7, 14) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 9) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 9) (9, 19) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 11) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 2) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 14) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the central nodes that have exactly three other nodes connected to them, forming a 3-star.

1. Central Node 0
2. Central Node 2
3. Central Node 8
4. Central Node 9
5. Central Node 10
6. Central Node 11
7. Central Node 12
8. Central Node 13
9. Central Node 15
10. Central Node 16
11. Central Node 17

Now, let's list down the unique 3-stars:

<0, (10, 9, 6)>
<2, (13, 17, 14)>
<8, (13, 5, 11)>
<9, (19, 0, 16)>
<10, (15, 0, 18)>
<11, (8, 1, 5)>
<12, (6, 19, 1)>
<13, (3, 17, 2)>
<15, (3, 10, 6)>
<16, (8, 7, 9)>
<17, (13, 2, 7)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
