Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 6) (27, 26) (27, 13) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 4) (17, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 2) (20, 5) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 13) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 8) (11, 24) (11, 21) (28, 14) (28, 24) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 20) (7, 0) (7, 26) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 23) (29, 9) (2, 20) (2, 12) (2, 6) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 24) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 26) (10, 28) (10, 26) (10, 8) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 12) (26, 10) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 13) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 23) (21, 11) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 4) (3, 0) (3, 18) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 22) (4, 21) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 20) (5, 21) (5, 8) (8, 22) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 5) (23, 1) (23, 16) (13, 27) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 16) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<15, (20, 1, 9)>
<27, (26, 13, 6)>
<14, (28, 19, 4)>
<9, (15, 22, 13)>
<22, (9, 4, 8)>
<11, (24, 21, 0)>
<28, (14, 24, 10)>
<0, (7, 3, 21)>
<7, (20, 0, 26)>
<1, (15, 16, 23)>
<29, (9, 5, 8)>
<2, (20, 12, 6)>
<18, (3, 0, 8)>
<19, (14, 17, 24)>
<12, (2, 21, 26)>
<10, (28, 26, 8)>
<16, (1, 13, 23)>
<21, (11, 12, 5)>
<3, (0, 4, 18)>
<4, (14, 22, 21)>
<5, (20, 21, 8)>
<8, (22, 10, 3)>
<23, (1, 16, 13)>
<13, (27, 9, 24)>
<6, (15, 2, 4)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [25].
