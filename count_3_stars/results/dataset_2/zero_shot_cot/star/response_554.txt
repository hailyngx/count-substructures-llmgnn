Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
The number of 3-star graphs can be counted by looking at the neighbors of each node. 

Let's count the number of 3-star graphs:
1. Node 5:
   - <5, (1, 4, 6)>
   - <5, (0, 1, 9)>

2. Node 9:
   - <9, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <9, (2, 3, 7)>

3. Node 4:
   - <4, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <4, (3, 7, 9)>

4. Node 7:
   - <7, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <7, (1, 2, 6)>

5. Node 6:
   - <6, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <6, (1, 5, 7)>

6. Node 2:
   - <2, (1, 3, 9)>
   - <2, (1, 3, 7)>

7. Node 8:
   - <8, (2, 0, 1)>
   - <8, (2, 0, 1)>

8. Node 1:
   - <1, (0, 2, 5)>
   - <1, (0, 2, 6)>

9. Node 3:
   - <3, (2, 4, 7)>
   - <3, (2, 4, 9)>

10. Node 0:
   - <0, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <0, (1, 2, 8)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-star graphs given above. So, the answer is [10].
