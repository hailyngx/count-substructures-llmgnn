Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 26) (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 25) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 19) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 13) (23, 19) (4, 1) (4, 9) (8, 11) (8, 1) (8, 0) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 28) (14, 24) (9, 16) (9, 22) (9, 4) (9, 10) (24, 14) (24, 26) (24, 12) (26, 16) (26, 0) (26, 24) (26, 5) (26, 20) (7, 20) (7, 17) (25, 21) (25, 22) (25, 28) (10, 21) (10, 9) (10, 28) (10, 29) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 15) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 24) (3, 16) (3, 28) (3, 29) (28, 14) (28, 25) (28, 10) (28, 3) (15, 5) (15, 19) (19, 27) (19, 23) (19, 15) (29, 10) (29, 3) (29, 6) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 18) (20, 26) (20, 7) (18, 5) (18, 17) (6, 2) (6, 29) (13, 11) (13, 23) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:
- From node 11: <11, (16, 13, 8)>
- From node 16: <16, (11, 3, 9)>
- From node 1: <1, (21, 14, 4)>
- From node 21: <21, (1, 10, 25)>
- From node 0: <0, (27, 14, 8)>
- From node 27: <27, (0, 19, -)>
- From node 22: <22, (23, 9, 25)>
- From node 23: <23, (22, 13, 19)>
- From node 4: <4, (1, 9, -)>
- From node 8: <8, (11, 1, 0)>
- From node 14: <14, (1, 28, 0)>
- From node 9: <9, (16, 22, 4)>
- From node 24: <24, (14, 26, 12)>
- From node 26: <26, (16, 0, 24)>
- From node 25: <25, (21, 22, 28)>
- From node 10: <10, (21, 9, 28)>
- From node 5: <5, (26, 2, 18)>
- From node 2: <2, (5, 6, 17)>
- From node 12: <12, (24, -, -)>
- From node 3: <3, (16, 28, 29)>
- From node 28: <28, (14, 25, 10)>
- From node 15: <15, (5, 19, -)>
- From node 19: <19, (27, 23, 15)>
- From node 29: <29, (10, 3, 6)>
- From node 17: <17, (7, 2, 18)>
- From node 20: <20, (26, 7, -)>
- From node 18: <18, (5, 17, -)>
- From node 6: <6, (2, 29, ->
- From node 7: <7, (20, 17, -)

Now count the total number of 3-stars: [28].
