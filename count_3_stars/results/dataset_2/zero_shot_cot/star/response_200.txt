Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 15) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 14) (2, 7) (2, 14) (18, 13) (18, 1) (0, 19) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (5, 14) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 5) (12, 6) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 1) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes with their adjacent nodes will form the 3-stars.

1. Node 11 is connected to nodes 16, 10, and 4. <11, (16, 10, 4)>
2. Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 1, and 15. <16, (11, 1, 15)>
3. Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 7, and 9. <4, (11, 7, 9)>
4. Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 2. <7, (4, 2, 2)>
5. Node 8 is connected to nodes 13, 19, and 14. <8, (13, 19, 14)>
6. Node 13 is connected to nodes 8, 19, and 18. <13, (8, 19, 18)>
7. Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 19. <10, (11, 6, 19)>
8. Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 14. It does not form a 3-star.
9. Node 18 is connected to nodes 13, 1, and 1. <18, (13, 1, 1)>
10. Node 14 is connected to nodes 8, 10, and 2. <14, (8, 10, 2)>
11. Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 4, and 8. <3, (11, 4, 8)>
12. Node 5 is connected to nodes 14, 19, and 15. <5, (14, 19, 15)>
13. Node 19 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 10. <19, (8, 13, 10)>
14. Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 15, and 1. <12, (6, 15, 1)>
15. Node 1 is connected to nodes 16, 18, and 9. <1, (16, 18, 9)>
16. Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 12, and 0. <6, (10, 12, 0)>
17. Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 1. It does not form a 3-star.
18. Node 15 is connected to nodes 16, 5, and 12. <15, (16, 5, 12)>
19. Node 17 is connected to node 8. It does not form a 3-star.
20. Node 0 is connected to node 19. It does not form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 16, represented as [16].
