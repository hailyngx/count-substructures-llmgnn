Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's examine the possible 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node: 4
   Connected nodes: 0, 5, 6
   Number of 3-star: 1
   <4, (0, 5, 6)>

2. Central node: 7
   Connected nodes: 0, 3, 6
   Number of 3-star: 1
   <7, (0, 3, 6)>

3. Central node: 8
   Connected nodes: 0, 3, 1
   Number of 3-star: 1
   <8, (0, 3, 1)>

4. Central node: 5
   Connected nodes: 4, 6, 2
   Number of 3-star: 1
   <5, (4, 6, 2)>

5. Central node: 0
   Connected nodes: 4, 7, 8
   Number of 3-star: 1
   <0, (4, 7, 8)>

6. Central node: 6
   Connected nodes: 4, 7, 5
   Number of 3-star: 1
   <6, (4, 7, 5)>

7. Central node: 1
   Connected nodes: 7, 8, 5
   Number of 3-star: 1
   <1, (7, 8, 5)>

8. Central node: 3
   Connected nodes: 7, 8, 6
   Number of 3-star: 1
   <3, (7, 8, 6)>

9. Central node: 9
   Connected nodes: 7, 0, 1
   Number of 3-star: 1
   <9, (7, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
