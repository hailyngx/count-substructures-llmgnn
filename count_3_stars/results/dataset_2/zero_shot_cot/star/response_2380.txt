Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node (node 5) in the given graph:
- Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 6 are connected to node 5.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph. We need to find all possible combinations of three nodes connected to the center node (5) to form 3-stars.

Counting the 3-stars:
- There are two 3-stars with center node 5: <5, (1, 2, 4)> and <5, (1, 2, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
The unique 3-stars found are: <<5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 6)>>.
