Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 26) (27, 0) (27, 14) (27, 1) (27, 6) (27, 8) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 7) (29, 19) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 24) (11, 21) (11, 20) (28, 16) (28, 5) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 22) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 23) (8, 27) (8, 24) (8, 25) (8, 12) (9, 20) (9, 12) (16, 28) (16, 22) (16, 18) (16, 23) (22, 1) (22, 16) (22, 10) (18, 16) (18, 7) (19, 29) (19, 20) (5, 29) (5, 28) (5, 26) (5, 21) (5, 3) (26, 0) (26, 5) (21, 11) (21, 5) (10, 0) (10, 22) (10, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 3) (6, 27) (6, 17) (24, 29) (24, 8) (24, 13) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 25) (12, 17) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 13) (13, 10) (13, 3) (13, 24) (13, 12) (14, 27) (14, 29) (14, 20) (14, 25) (4, 1) (25, 8) (25, 23) (25, 14) (20, 11) (20, 9) (20, 19) (20, 14) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (27, 10, 26)>
<27, (0, 14, 1)>
<17, (6, 12, 15)>
<29, (19, 5, 14)>
<1, (27, 15, 4)>
<15, (17, 1, 23)>
<8, (27, 24, 25)>
<16, (28, 22, 18)>
<22, (1, 16, 10)>
<5, (29, 28, 26)>
<26, (0, 5, 3)>
<21, (11, 5, 3)>
<10, (0, 22, 13)>
<3, (5, 7, 13)>
<7, (17, 18, 3)>
<24, (29, 8, 13)>
<23, (15, 16, 25)>
<12, (17, 8, 9)>
<13, (10, 3, 24)>
<14, (27, 29, 20)>
<25, (8, 23, 14)>
<20, (11, 9, 19)>

Count of 3-stars: [21]
