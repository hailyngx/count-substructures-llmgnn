Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 19) (9, 2) (9, 20) (9, 0) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 22) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 2) (7, 11) (7, 23) (7, 18) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 1) (28, 11) (28, 16) (26, 25) (26, 8) (26, 13) (4, 11) (4, 27) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (27, 4) (27, 25) (27, 5) (16, 28) (16, 3) (16, 2) (1, 12) (1, 4) (1, 15) (1, 20) (15, 1) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 29) (20, 23) (29, 20) (29, 0) (29, 22) (29, 14) (21, 10) (21, 24) (25, 26) (25, 27) (25, 23) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 29) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 18) (8, 26) (8, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 23) (24, 21) (24, 0) (24, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 27) (0, 9) (0, 29) (0, 24) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 24) (18, 13) (22, 10) (22, 29) (23, 7) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 19) (13, 26) (13, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the given graph:

<9, (2, 20, 0)>
<11, (7, 28, 4)>
<4, (11, 27, 5)>
<1, (12, 15, 20)>
<20, (9, 1, 29)>
<29, (20, 0, 22)>
<21, (10, 24, -)>
<12, (17, 14, -)>
<17, (12, 8, 18)>
<8, (26, 17, -)>
<19, (6, 3, 23)>
<24, (21, 0, 18)>
<25, (26, 27, 23)>
<14, (12, 29, 2)>
<16, (28, 3, 2)>
<15, (1, -)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [15]
