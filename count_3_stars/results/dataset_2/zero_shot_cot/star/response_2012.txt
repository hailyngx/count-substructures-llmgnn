Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 28) (6, 5) (6, 19) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 12) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 11) (4, 25) (4, 17) (18, 10) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 0) (5, 16) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 25) (0, 2) (0, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 13) (27, 9) (27, 10) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 21) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 11) (21, 16) (21, 19) (21, 12) (21, 14) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 29) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 19) (3, 18) (3, 24) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 20) (11, 25) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 12) (12, 15) (12, 21) (12, 24) (12, 22) (12, 14) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 22) (13, 20) (13, 1) (13, 29) (13, 14) (29, 10) (29, 23) (29, 13) (29, 14) (14, 21) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 29) (19, 6) (19, 21) (19, 24) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, thus forming a 3-star.

The nodes with three incident edges are: 1, 5, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, and 29.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars present in the graph.
After identifying and counting the 3-stars, we find that there are 7 unique 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<1, (15, 5, 28)>
<5, (6, 1, 22)>
<12, (15, 21, 24)>
<13, (20, 1, 29)>
<14, (21, 12, 29)>
<21, (16, 19, 14)>
<29, (13, 14, 23)>
