Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 1) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 11) (2, 22) (2, 29) (2, 6) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 5) (29, 24) (1, 13) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 23) (8, 16) (8, 26) (23, 8) (23, 26) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 15) (20, 13) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 14) (26, 8) (26, 23) (21, 13) (21, 28) (21, 18) (21, 17) (28, 0) (28, 21) (9, 22) (9, 25) (9, 27) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 27) (4, 11) (27, 9) (27, 4) (27, 17) (16, 29) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 18) (18, 21) (18, 16) (18, 11) (19, 17) (19, 6) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 24) (17, 21) (17, 27) (17, 19) (17, 7) (25, 9) (5, 29) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 6) (7, 9) (7, 17) (7, 5) (7, 24) (24, 29) (24, 14) (24, 12) (24, 7) (24, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 24) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes forming a 3-star configuration. 

From the given edges, we can observe the following nodes that fit the 3-star pattern:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 22, 29, and 6 forming <2, (22, 29, 6)>
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 27, and 11 forming <4, (3, 27, 11)>
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 22, 25, and 7 forming <9, (22, 25, 7)>
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 22, 18, and 4 forming <11, (22, 18, 4)>
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 21, 20, and 1 forming <13, (21, 20, 1)>
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 29, 8, and 0 forming <16, (29, 8, 0)>
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 21, 27, and 19 forming <17, (21, 27, 19)>
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 29, 14, and 7 forming <24, (29, 14, 7)>
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 8, 23, and 26 forming <26, (8, 23, 26)>

Let's count how many unique 3-stars are there in total [9].
