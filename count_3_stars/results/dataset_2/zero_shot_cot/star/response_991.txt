Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 7) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 12) 

Response:
There are 3-star graphs in this graph. Let's find them step by step:

1. Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 14, 12, 6.
   <0, (4, 7, 14)>
   <0, (4, 6, 12)>

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 2.
   <1, (5, 8, 2)>

3. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 5, 0, 14, 1, 6.
   <2, (5, 0, 14)>
   <2, (5, 1, 8)>
   <2, (0, 1, 6)>

4. Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 5, 4.
   <3, (5, 4, 0)>

5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 11, 6.
   <4, (0, 3, 6)>

6. Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 2, 8, 1, 10, 3.
   <5, (2, 8, 1)>
   <5, (2, 10, 3)>
   <5, (8, 10, 3)>

7. Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 4, 7, 0, 14, 2.
   <6, (4, 7, 0)>
   <6, (4, 0, 12)>
   <6, (7, 0, 12)>
   <6, (0, 14, 2)>
   <6, (7, 13, 14)>

8. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 5, 14, 10, 11, 1.
   <8, (5, 14, 10)>
   <8, (5, 10, 3)>
   <8, (14, 10, 12)>
   <8, (10, 11, 2)>
   <8, (10, 12, 14)>

9. Node 11 has 4 neighbors: 9, 4, 8, 2.
   <11, (9, 4, 8)>

10. Node 12 has 3 neighbors: 9, 0, 6.
    <12, (9, 0, 6)>

11. Node 14 has 4 neighbors: 8, 0, 6, 2.
    <14, (8, 0, 2)>

The number of 3-star graphs in this graph is [21].
