Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 21) (22, 9) (22, 27) (22, 17) (20, 25) (20, 15) (20, 2) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 13) (25, 21) (25, 14) (10, 15) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 22) (17, 24) (17, 9) (17, 27) (4, 13) (8, 29) (8, 15) (8, 11) (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 23) (21, 18) (21, 25) (21, 28) (21, 26) (28, 21) (28, 12) (9, 22) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 0) (9, 13) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 19) (3, 29) (11, 20) (11, 8) (11, 7) (27, 22) (27, 25) (27, 17) (27, 6) (1, 6) (1, 16) (6, 27) (6, 1) (6, 23) (24, 17) (23, 15) (23, 3) (23, 6) (26, 21) (26, 5) (26, 12) (5, 26) (7, 18) (7, 3) (7, 11) (0, 9) (2, 20) (2, 19) (19, 3) (19, 2) (12, 18) (12, 28) (12, 26) (12, 13) (13, 25) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 29) (16, 10) (16, 1) (16, 14) (29, 8) (29, 3) (29, 13) (14, 25) (14, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's start by listing all unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 17, 29)>  
<1, (6, 16, 29)>  
<2, (19, 20, 25)>  
<3, (7, 19, 23)>  
<4, (13, 25, 29)>  
<5, (14, 25, 26)>  
<6, (1, 23, 27)>  
<7, (3, 11, 18)>  
<8, (11, 15, 29)>  
<9, (0, 10, 22)>  
<10, (9, 15, 16)>  
<11, (7, 8, 20)>  
<12, (13, 18, 26)>  
<13, (4, 9, 12)>  
<14, (5, 16, 25)>  
<15, (8, 10, 20)>  
<16, (1, 10, 14)>  
<17, (9, 22, 24)>  
<18, (7, 12, 21)>  
<19, (2, 3, 29)>  
<20, (2, 11, 25)>  
<21, (18, 21, 28)>  
<22, (9, 17, 27)>  
<23, (3, 6, 15)>  
<24, (17, 26, 0)>  
<25, (4, 14, 20)>  
<26, (5, 12, 21)>  
<27, (6, 17, 22)>  
<28, (12, 21, 18)>  
<29, (1, 4, 8)>  

There are 29 unique instances of 3-stars in the given graph, therefore the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
