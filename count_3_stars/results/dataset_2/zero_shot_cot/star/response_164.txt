Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 6) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 10) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's find all the nodes that are directly connected to node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 12, and 1.

Now, let's check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star with 5 as the center:
- For node 9: (5, 9, 1), (5, 9, 12)
- For node 12: (5, 12, 9), (5, 12, 4)

Therefore, there are two unique 3-stars with center node 5: <5, (9, 1, 12)>, <5, (12, 9, 4)>.

Let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
Thus, the final answer is [2].
