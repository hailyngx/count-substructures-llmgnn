Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 20) (3, 16) (3, 5) (15, 6) (15, 5) (15, 4) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 4) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 10) (18, 7) (18, 21) (22, 27) (22, 18) (22, 23) (22, 10) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 4) (23, 27) (23, 22) (6, 15) (6, 28) (9, 20) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 12) (19, 27) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 4) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 14) (21, 18) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 11) (21, 24) (24, 26) (24, 21) (7, 18) (1, 25) (1, 29) (1, 10) (17, 5) (17, 2) (4, 15) (4, 0) (4, 25) (4, 19) (12, 28) (12, 21) (16, 3) (16, 29) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 13) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 1) (29, 1) (29, 16) (11, 19) (11, 21) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 2) (20, 5) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 25) (5, 17) (5, 20) (13, 14) (2, 27) (2, 17) (2, 14) (2, 20) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (27, 10, 4)>
<1, (25, 29, 10)>
<2, (27, 17, 14)>
<3, (20, 16, 5)>
<4, (15, 19, 4)>
<5, (15, 25, 17)>
<6, (15, 6, 28)>
<11, (19, 21, 11)>
<12, (28, 21, 12)>
<13, (14, 26, 13)>
<18, (22, 26, 18)>
<27, (22, 2, 27)>
