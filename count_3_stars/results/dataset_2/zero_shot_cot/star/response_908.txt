Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 27) (4, 15) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 3) (18, 11) (18, 25) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 20) (22, 12) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 21) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 23) (12, 22) (12, 5) (27, 4) (27, 10) (27, 20) (6, 24) (6, 20) (28, 3) (28, 0) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 26) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 19) (10, 7) (10, 27) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 2) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 14) (11, 8) (23, 3) (23, 11) (23, 9) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 8) (2, 22) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 25) (20, 22) (20, 27) (20, 6) (20, 29) (29, 20) (29, 26) (25, 18) (25, 17) (25, 2) (14, 22) (14, 11) (14, 26) (14, 16) (26, 5) (26, 29) (26, 14) (26, 16) (19, 13) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 28) (24, 6) (9, 10) (9, 23) (9, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 17) (8, 16) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 26) (16, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which can form a 3-star with the current node:

- Node 2: (2, 22), (2, 15), (2, 9), (2, 16), (2, 25)
- Node 3: (3, 21), (3, 1), (3, 28), (3, 23)
- Node 5: (5, 12), (5, 13), (5, 26)
- Node 7: (7, 21), (7, 0), (7, 10)
- Node 8: (8, 10), (8, 11), (8, 17), (8, 16)
- Node 11: (11, 18), (11, 23), (11, 14), (11, 8)
- Node 12: (12, 22), (12, 5)
- Node 13: (13, 5), (13, 17), (13, 19)
- Node 14: (14, 22), (14, 11), (14, 26), (14, 16)
- Node 15: (15, 4), (15, 10), (15, 2)
- Node 16: (16, 2), (16, 14), (16, 26), (16, 8)
- Node 20: (20, 22), (20, 27), (20, 6), (20, 29)
- Node 21: (21, 7), (21, 3)
- Node 22: (22, 2), (22, 14), (22, 20), (22, 12)
- Node 23: (23, 3), (23, 11), (23, 9)
- Node 25: (25, 18), (25, 17), (25, 2)
- Node 26: (26, 5), (26, 29), (26, 14), (26, 16)
- Node 27: (27, 4), (27, 10), (27, 20)
- Node 28: (28, 3), (28, 0)
- Node 29: (29, 20), (29, 26)

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars:

<2, (22, 15, 9)>
<3, (21, 1, 28)>
<5, (12, 13, 26)>
<7, (21, 0, 10)>
<8, (10, 11, 17)>
<11, (18, 23, 14)>
<12, (22, 5, 12)>
<13, (5, 17, 19)>
<14, (22, 11, 26)>
<15, (4, 10, 2)>
<16, (2, 14, 26)>
<20, (22, 27, 6)>
<21, (7, 3, 21)>
<22, (2, 14, 20)>
<23, (3, 11, 9)>
<25, (18, 17, 2)>
<26, (5, 29, 14)>
