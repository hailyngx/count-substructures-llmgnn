Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 4, node 7, and node 1, since these nodes could potentially form 3-stars. 
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 5, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 2, and 8.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. 
1. Consider node 4 as the center:
   - <4, (7, 5, 3)>
   - <4, (0, 5, 3)>

2. Consider node 7 as the center:
   - <7, (4, 9, 5)>

3. Consider node 1 as the center:
   - <1, (3, 6, 2)>
   - <1, (3, 8, 2)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
