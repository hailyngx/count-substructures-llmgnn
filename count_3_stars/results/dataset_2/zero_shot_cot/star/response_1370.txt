Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of the specified structure, which is a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 1, 0)>
<6, (5, 11, 12)>
<1, (9, 3, 11)>
<3, (1, 0, 11)>
<11, (6, 1, 3)>
<4, (1, 8, 13)>
<8, (5, 1, 10)>
<2, (4, 13, 14)>
<7, (11, 2, 5)>
<10, (11, 8, 0)>
<14, (4, 2, 13)>
<13, (4, 2, 14)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-stars: [13].
