Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can identify each 3-star by looking at nodes that are connected in a specific pattern:
1. The central node must have degree 3.
2. The leaves connected to the central node must not be connected to each other.

Let's list the unique 3-stars identified in the graph:

<4, (7, 8, 2)>
<6, (9, 4, 1)>
<7, (4, 8, 3)>
<8, (4, 7, 2)>
<9, (6, 4, 5)>

Now we can count the total number of 3-stars in the graph by counting the unique 3-stars listed above.
