Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<0, (7, 1, 6)>
<1, (9, 4, 2)>
<2, (9, 1, 6)>
<3, (9, 4, 8)>
<4, (9, 1, 8)>
<5, (7, 6, 0)>
<6, (7, 1, 0)>
<7, (5, 6, 0)>
<8, (9, 4, 3)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>

There are a total of 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph, so the final answer is [10].
