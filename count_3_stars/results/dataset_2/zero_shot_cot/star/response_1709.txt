Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 22) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 4) (26, 17) (15, 2) (15, 11) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 1) (14, 6) (14, 25) (17, 26) (17, 27) (17, 12) (3, 27) (3, 25) (3, 21) (3, 10) (3, 29) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 8) (22, 9) (22, 23) (22, 5) (23, 22) (23, 21) (23, 28) (23, 19) (20, 2) (20, 28) (21, 26) (21, 3) (21, 23) (21, 16) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 29) (0, 1) (16, 21) (16, 0) (1, 27) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 8) (8, 25) (8, 6) (8, 11) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 7) (19, 23) (19, 4) (4, 26) (4, 0) (4, 19) (10, 3) (10, 18) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 24) (24, 7) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 29) (12, 11) (18, 10) (5, 22) (5, 1) (5, 11) (29, 3) (29, 0) (29, 12) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 5) (13, 9) (13, 28) 

Response:
First, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential centers of 3-stars. The nodes that fit this criteria are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 18, 19, 20, 24, and 25.

Next, we will check each of these potential center nodes and see if they form 3-stars. 

Checking for 3-stars involving node 1:
- Node 1 has connections with nodes 27, 0, 6, and 5. This forms a 3-star: <1, (27, 0, 6)>. 

Checking for 3-stars involving node 2:
- Node 2 has connections with nodes 15, 20, and 7. However, they do not form a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 4:
- Node 4 has connections with nodes 26, 0, and 19. This forms a 3-star: <4, (26, 0, 19)>.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 5:
- Node 5 has connections with nodes 22, 1, and 11. However, they do not form a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 6:
- Node 6 has a connection with node 14, but it does not form a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 7:
- Node 7 has a connection with node 24, but it does not form a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 8:
- Node 8 has a connection with node 25, but it does not form a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 13:
- Node 13 has a connection with node 28, but it does not form a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 15:
- Node 15 has connections with nodes 2, 11, and 27. This forms a 3-star: <15, (2, 11, 27)>.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 18:
- Node 18 has a connection with node 10, but it does not form a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 19:
- Node 19 has connections with nodes 23, 4, and 11. This forms a 3-star: <19, (23, 4, 11)>.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 20:
- Node 20 has connections with nodes 2, 28, and 1. However, they do not form a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 24:
- Node 24 has a connection with node 7, but it does not form a 3-star.

Checking for 3-stars involving node 25:
- Node 25 has a connection with node 8, but it does not form a 3-star.

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (27, 0, 6)>, <4, (26, 0, 19)>, and <15, (2, 11, 27)>.
