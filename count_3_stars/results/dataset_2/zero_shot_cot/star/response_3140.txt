Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 16) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 17) (11, 2) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 15) (18, 4) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (7, 10) (7, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 14) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 2) (16, 9) (16, 17) (16, 14) (15, 4) (15, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 16) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (14, 19) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 6 since it has the highest degree (5) in the graph. The nodes connected to node 6 are: 9, 17, 2.

Next, let's look for 3-stars with 6 as the center node:
- 3-star 1: <6, (9, 16, 17)>
- 3-star 2: <6, (2, 11, 17)>
- 3-star 3: <6, (2, 13, 14)>
- 3-star 4: <6, (2, 12, 14)>
- 3-star 5: <6, (9, 16, 14)>
- 3-star 6: <6, (17, 11, 16)>

Next, let's identify the 3-stars with other center nodes:
- 3-star 7: <4, (1, 18, 13)>
- 3-star 8: <16, (9, 17, 14)>
- 3-star 9: <15, (4, 19, 14)>

Finally, count the total number of unique 3-stars: [9].
