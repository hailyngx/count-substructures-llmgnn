Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three edges. These nodes are good candidates for being the center of a 3-star since they can be connected to exactly three other nodes. 
The nodes with three edges are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 0: edges (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 2) form a 3-star. <0, (5, 6, 2)>
- For node 1: edges (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 2) form a 3-star. <1, (4, 6, 2)>
- For node 3: edges (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 8) form a 3-star. <3, (0, 2, 8)>
- For node 4: edges (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 1) form a 3-star. <4, (7, 8, 1)>
- For node 9: edges (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 7) form a 3-star. <9, (5, 8, 7)>

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
<0, (5, 6, 2)>, <1, (4, 6, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 1)>, <9, (5, 8, 7)>
