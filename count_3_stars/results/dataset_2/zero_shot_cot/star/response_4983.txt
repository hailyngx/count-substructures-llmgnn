Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 4, 14)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 8, 14)>
<3, (4, 11, 12)>
<4, (1, 9, 12)>
<5, (6, 7, 13)>
<6, (5, 9, 13)>
<7, (1, 5, 11)>
<8, (0, 2, 14)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<10, (11, 14, 7)>
<11, (3, 7, 13)>
<12, (3, 4, 9)>
<13, (5, 6, 11)>
<14, (0, 1, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [15]
