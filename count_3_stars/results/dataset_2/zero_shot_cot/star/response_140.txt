Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 6, 8, 3

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (6, 5, 1), (6, 3, 9), (6, 1, 8), (6, 5, 3) (Total: 4)
- Node 1: (0, 6, 8), (0, 5, 1), (0, 3, 9), (0, 1, 2) (Total: 4)
- Node 2: (4, 9, 8), (4, 6, 2), (4, 8, 3), (4, 2, 6) (Total: 4)
- Node 3: (8, 9, 3), (8, 3, 0), (8, 1, 0) (Total: 3)
- Node 4: (7, 5, 4), (7, 5, 1), (7, 8, 4), (7, 8, 2) (Total: 4)
- Node 5: (4, 7, 5), (4, 5, 1), (4, 5, 0) (Total: 3)
- Node 6: (0, 6, 9), (0, 6, 1), (0, 6, 2), (0, 6, 5) (Total: 4)
- Node 7: (4, 7, 5), (4, 7, 8) (Total: 2)
- Node 8: (2, 8, 3), (2, 8, 1), (2, 8, 9), (2, 8, 7) (Total: 4)
- Node 9: (8, 9, 3), (8, 9, 2), (8, 9, 6) (Total: 3)
