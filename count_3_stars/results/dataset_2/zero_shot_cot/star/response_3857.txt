Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:

<5, (9, 13, 3)>
<5, (9, 10, 7)>
<10, (0, 7, 14)>
<4, (11, 8, 12)>
<13, (6, 11, 0)>
<7, (8, 2, 10)>
<12, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (6, 10, 8)>
<3, (8, 12, 2)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph is [10].
