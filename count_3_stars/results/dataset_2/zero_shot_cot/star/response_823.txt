Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 18) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 2) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 18) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 12) (15, 6) (15, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 17) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 19) (5, 8) (5, 4) (17, 15) (17, 0) (17, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 6, node 9, and node 13 since they have degree 4, which indicates they are the central nodes of potential 3-stars.

For node 6: {9, 1, 15, 13}
For node 9: {6, 8, 18}
For node 13: {6, 8, 16, 2}

Next, let's check if any of these nodes are connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

Thus, the 3-stars in the graph are: 
<6, (9, 1, 15)>
<9, (6, 8, 18)>
<13, (8, 16, 2)>

Now, count the number of unique 3-stars and include them in brackets: [3].
