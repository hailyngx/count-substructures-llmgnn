Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 23) (9, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 2) (3, 21) (3, 22) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 17) (25, 16) (25, 12) (10, 17) (10, 4) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 21) (4, 10) (8, 3) (8, 5) (13, 26) (13, 20) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 20) (20, 13) (20, 5) (20, 11) (21, 3) (21, 17) (21, 0) (21, 11) (21, 29) (24, 26) (24, 18) (24, 19) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 21) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 22) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 22) (2, 28) (22, 3) (22, 7) (22, 2) (22, 27) (11, 20) (11, 21) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 6) (18, 24) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 1) (23, 9) (23, 18) (23, 1) (23, 28) (6, 14) (1, 18) (1, 23) (29, 21) (29, 12) (27, 22) (27, 16) (19, 9) (19, 17) (19, 24) (16, 25) (16, 10) (16, 27) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 29) (12, 28) (28, 2) (28, 23) (28, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to form 3-stars:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 15, 5, and 21.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 26, 5, and 22.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 21, 8, and 22.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 0, and 20.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 14, and 22.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 4, and 16.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 20, 21, and 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 25, 11, and 28.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 26, 20, and 11.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 25, 10, and 27.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 15, 10, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 24, 11, and 23.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 9, 17, and 24.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 3, 17, and 29.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 27.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 9, 18, and 1.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 26, 18, and 19.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 2, 23, and 12.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 21, 12, and 14.

To count the number of 3-stars, we can simply count the number of unique combinations mentioned above. Let's list down the unique 3-stars:

<0, (15, 5, 21)>
<2, (26, 5, 22)>
<3, (21, 8, 22)>
<5, (8, 0, 20)>
<7, (0, 14, 22)>
<10, (17, 4, 16)>
<11, (20, 21, 14)>
<12, (25, 11, 28)>
<13, (26, 20, 11)>
<16, (25, 10, 27)>
<17, (15, 10, 19)>
<18, (24, 11, 23)>
<19, (9, 17, 24)>
<21, (3, 17, 29)>
<22, (2, 7, 27)>
<23, (9, 18, 1)>
<24, (26, 18, 19)>
<28, (2, 23, 12)>
<29, (21, 12, 14)>

Therefore, there are a total of [19] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
