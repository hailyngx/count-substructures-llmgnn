Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 19) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 6) (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 6) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 18) (4, 3) (4, 18) (18, 17) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 16) (2, 12) (2, 7) (8, 11) (8, 6) (0, 15) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (16, 18) (16, 0) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 12) (13, 14) (6, 15) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 19) (11, 5) (11, 18) (11, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list the unique 3-stars present in the graph:

<3, (15, 7, 19)>
<15, (3, 10, 19)>
<18, (17, 4, 16)>
<2, (12, 7, 0)>
<0, (15, 9, 7)>
<12, (2, 13, 14)>
<14, (12, 13, ...)> (incomplete 3-star)

With the given edges, we have found 6 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
