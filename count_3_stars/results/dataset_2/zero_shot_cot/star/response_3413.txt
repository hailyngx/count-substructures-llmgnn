Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 28) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 12) (21, 16) (21, 4) (21, 25) (21, 15) (2, 3) (2, 15) (8, 25) (8, 7) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 27) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 22) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 20) (17, 12) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 28) (7, 8) (7, 25) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 13) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 7) (0, 7) (0, 29) (0, 23) (22, 11) (22, 27) (16, 21) (16, 15) (6, 8) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 4) (24, 5) (24, 6) (24, 10) (24, 15) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 28) (23, 0) (26, 27) (27, 3) (27, 22) (27, 26) (29, 0) (29, 10) (18, 11) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 13) (15, 9) (15, 21) (15, 2) (15, 16) (15, 24) (13, 1) (13, 20) (13, 7) (13, 12) (10, 24) (10, 29) (10, 4) (28, 9) (28, 20) (28, 14) (19, 1) (19, 7) (4, 21) (4, 6) (4, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (9, 14, 24)>
<9, (5, 15, 28)>
<1, (13, 19, 12)>
<21, (16, 4, 25)>
<7, (8, 25, 19)>
<25, (21, 8, 7)>
<11, (3, 14, 22)>
<17, (11, 20, 12)>
<20, (17, 13, 28)>
<0, (7, 23, 29)>
<27, (3, 22, 26)>
<6, (8, 14, 24)>
<15, (9, 21, 2)>
<13, (1, 20, 7)>
<10, (24, 29, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
