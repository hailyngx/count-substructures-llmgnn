Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we can look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. From the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

1. Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 1), (6, 3)
   <6, (5, 1, 3)>

2. Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 9), (1, 3)
   <1, (6, 9, 3)>

3. Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 1), (3, 5)
   <3, (6, 1, 5)>

4. Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3)
   <4, (9, 1, 3)>

5. Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 2)
   <8, (6, 4, 2)>

6. Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1)
   <9, (4, 2, 1)>

7. Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 4), (0, 2)
   <0, (9, 4, 2)>

8. Node 2: (2, 9), (2, 1), (2, 8)
   <2, (9, 1, 8)>

9. Node 7: (7, 8), (7, 2), (7, 0)
   <7, (8, 2, 0)>

10. Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 3), (5, *)
   <5, (6, 3, *)>

Since each unique 3-star is listed only once, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
