Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-star graph in the given graph.

1. For node 5: 
- (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1)
<5, (2, 8, 1)>

2. For node 9: 
- (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 1)
<9, (4, 2, 1)>

3. For node 6: 
- (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 3)
<6, (1, 7, 3)>

4. For node 4: 
- (4, 9), (4, 0), (4, 3)
<4, (9, 0, 3)>

5. For node 8: 
- (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 0)
<8, (5, 6, 0)>

6. For node 0: 
- (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 4)
<0, (5, 6, 4)>

7. For node 2: 
- (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 0)
<2, (5, 9, 0)>

8. For node 1: 
- (1, 5), (1, 9), (1, 6)
<1, (5, 9, 6)>

9. For node 3: 
- (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 4)
<3, (5, 6, 4)>

10. For node 7: 
- (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 2)
<7, (9, 6, 2)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
