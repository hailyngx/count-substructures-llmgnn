Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 5) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 18) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (6, 13) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 12) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 5) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 16) (0, 2) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 16) (9, 14) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 15, 13)>
<4, (7, 1, 16)>
<5, (7, 1, 19)>
<7, (4, 5, 17)>
<10, (19, 14, 10)>
<11, (17, 5, 14)>
<12, (8, 14, 18)>
<13, (3, 17, 6)>
<14, (15, 10, 11)>
<16, (4, 2, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [11].
