Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's go through the nodes and identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3) - forms a 3-star <0, (4, 7, 3)>
- Node 1: (1, 8), (1, 2), (1, 7) - forms a 3-star <1, (8, 2, 7)>
- Node 2: (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 5) - forms a 3-star <2, (6, 8, 5)>
- Node 3: (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 5) - forms a 3-star <3, (6, 9, 5)>
- Node 4: (4, 6), (4, 9), (4, 8) - forms a 3-star <4, (6, 9, 8)>
- Node 5: (5, 6), (5, 2), (5, 3) - forms a 3-star <5, (6, 2, 3)>
- Node 6: (6, 5), (6, 3), (6, 2) - forms a 3-star <6, (5, 3, 2)>
- Node 7: (7, 8), (7, 5), (7, 0) - forms a 3-star <7, (8, 5, 0)>
- Node 8: (8, 6), (8, 4), (8, 2) - forms a 3-star <8, (6, 4, 2)>
- Node 9: (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 6) - forms a 3-star <9, (4, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
