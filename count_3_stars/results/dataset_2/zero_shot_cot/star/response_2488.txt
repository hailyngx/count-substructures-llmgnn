Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 17) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 12) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 0) (8, 15) (8, 10) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 16) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (13, 14) (1, 18) (1, 12) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 2) (7, 18) (16, 5) (16, 18) (19, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

We will first identify the nodes connected to each node (neighbors) based on the given edges:

Node 0: 3, 14, 11, 4
Node 1: 18, 12
Node 2: 3, 5, 12, 19
Node 3: 15, 0, 2, 4
Node 4: 3, 8, 18, 0
Node 5: 6, 2, 16
Node 6: 17, 9, 5
Node 7: 18
Node 8: 15, 10, 4
Node 9: 6, 10
Node 10: 9, 11, 8
Node 11: 14, 10, 0, 12
Node 12: 15, 17, 11, 1, 2
Node 13: 14
Node 14: 17, 0, 11, 13
Node 15: 3, 8, 12
Node 16: 5, 18
Node 17: 14, 6, 12
Node 18: 4, 16, 7, 1
Node 19: 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

<0, (4, 14, 3)>
<2, (3, 5, 12)>
<3, (15, 0, 2)>
<4, (18, 8, 0)>
<5, (6, 16, 2)>
<6, (17, 9, 5)>
<8, (15, 10, 4)>
<10, (9, 11, 8)>
<11, (14, 10, 0)>
<12, (15, 17, 11)>
<14, (17, 0, 11)>
<15, (3, 8, 12)>
<16, (5, 18, 6)>
<17, (14, 6, 12)>
<18, (4, 16, 7)>
<19, (2, 12, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 14, 3)>, <2, (3, 5, 12)>, <3, (15, 0, 2)>, <4, (18, 8, 0)>, <5, (6, 16, 2)>, <6, (17, 9, 5)>, <8, (15, 10, 4)>, <10, (9, 11, 8)>, <11, (14, 10, 0)>, <12, (15, 17, 11)>, <14, (17, 0, 11)>, <15, (3, 8, 12)>, <16, (5, 18, 6)>, <17, (14, 6, 12)>, <18, (4, 16, 7)>, <19, (2, 12, 0)>
