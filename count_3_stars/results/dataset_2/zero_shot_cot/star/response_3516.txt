Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <2, (6, 9, 4)>
2. <4, (9, 2, 7)>
3. <7, (4, 8, 14)>
4. <8, (4, 2, 11)>
5. <9, (6, 4, 1)>
6. <11, (7, 8, 1)>
7. <12, (2, 5, 10)>
8. <13, (4, 0, 11)>
9. <14, (7, 5, 10)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph.
