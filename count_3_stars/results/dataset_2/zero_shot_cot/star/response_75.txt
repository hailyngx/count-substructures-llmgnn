Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 14) 

Response:
First, let's count the number of occurrences of each node in an edge:

- Node 0: 3 occurrences
- Node 1: 5 occurrences
- Node 2: 4 occurrences
- Node 3: 4 occurrences
- Node 4: 4 occurrences
- Node 5: 3 occurrences
- Node 6: 3 occurrences
- Node 7: 4 occurrences
- Node 8: 4 occurrences
- Node 9: 5 occurrences
- Node 10: 3 occurrences
- Node 11: 2 occurrences
- Node 12: 4 occurrences
- Node 13: 3 occurrences
- Node 14: 3 occurrences

Now, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs. Each 3-star has one central node connected to three other nodes. Here are the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (3, 5, 10)>
<2, (4, 6, 12)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (2, 6, 12)>
<5, (1, 8, 10)>
<6, (2, 4, 14)>
<7, (1, 4, 14)>
<8, (1, 5, 12)>
<9, (10, 11, 14)>
<12, (2, 8, 12)>
<13, (0, 4, 8)>

Count of 3-stars: [11]
