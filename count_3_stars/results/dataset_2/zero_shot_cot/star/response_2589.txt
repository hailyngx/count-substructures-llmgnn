Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 10) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 4) (10, 14) (10, 17) (10, 1) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 9) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 19) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 15) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (19, 12) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 18) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list all the 3-stars identified in the graph:
<1, (4, 7, 10)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<4, (1, 15, 17)>
<6, (1, 11, 12)>
<8, (5, 9, 11)>
<9, (8, 12, 14)>
<10, (1, 14, 17)>
<11, (6, 8, 15)>
<12, (6, 9, 19)>
<13, (15, 16, 17)>
<16, (0, 3, 18)>
<17, (4, 10, 13)>
<18, (3, 6, 13)>
<19, (9, 12, 19)>

Count of 3-stars in the given graph: [14]
