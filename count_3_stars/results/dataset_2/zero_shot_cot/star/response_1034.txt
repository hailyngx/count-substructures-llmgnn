Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 5) (8, 14) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 13) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 3) (12, 9) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (6, 9, 11)>
2. <2, (4, 12, 13)>
3. <3, (10, 13, 4)>
4. <4, (9, 12, 2)>
5. <5, (7, 10, 13)>
6. <6, (1, 9, 11)>
7. <7, (5, 11, 13)>
8. <8, (10, 14, 5)>
9. <9, (4, 6, 12)>
10. <10, (3, 8, 14)>
11. <11, (7, 9, 1)>
12. <12, (2, 4, 9)>
13. <13, (3, 7, 12)>
14. <14, (0, 8, 10)>

There are a total of [14] 3-stars in the graph.
