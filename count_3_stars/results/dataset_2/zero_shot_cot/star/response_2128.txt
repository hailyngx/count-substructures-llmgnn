Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 9) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 9) (2, 4) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 9) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

In a 3-star, the central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
Looking at the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars: 
<4, (2, 6, 10)>
<7, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 14)>
<3, (1, 9, 11)>
<10, (4, 5, 13)>
<11, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<13, (9, 10, 12)>
<5, (8, 10, 11)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<0, (6, 11, 14)>
<14, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 4, 11)>
<12, (2, 5, 13)>
<9, (2, 13, 14)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars identified, we find:
