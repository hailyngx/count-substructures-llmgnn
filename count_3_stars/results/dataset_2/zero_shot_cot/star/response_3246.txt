Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 1) (18, 8) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (13, 12) (13, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 10) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (14, 2) (14, 12) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 9) (17, 6) (19, 2) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 15) (0, 6) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 19) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) (10, 2) (10, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the central node and the three leaves connected to it. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Identify nodes with degree 3:
   - Node 2 and Node 18 have degree 3.

2. For each node with degree 3, check if its neighbors are connected to each other:
   - Node 2 is connected to Node 8 and Node 14. Node 8 and Node 14 are not connected.
   - Node 18 is connected to Node 4, Node 6, and Node 7. None of the neighbors are directly connected to each other.

3. Count the number of 3-stars:
   - There are no 3-stars in the given graph as the conditions for a 3-star are not satisfied.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [0].
