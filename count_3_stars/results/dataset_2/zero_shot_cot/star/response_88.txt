Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 3) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 0) (2, 8) (2, 16) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 14) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 16) (13, 17) (4, 6) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 1) (7, 6) (16, 2) (16, 5) (16, 18) (16, 15) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 19) (11, 2) (11, 19) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 3) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 16) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 16) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 19) (10, 1) 

Response:
Let's first identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <2, (8, 16, 11)>
2. <8, (2, 0, 12)>
3. <5, (14, 16, 15)>
4. <17, (6, 14, 13)>
5. <12, (4, 8, 18)>
6. <15, (14, 5, 16)>
7. <18, (14, 12, 16)>
8. <3, (9, 2, 19)>
9. <19, (1, 11, 3)>
10. <0, (17, 8, 5)>
11. <4, (6, 12, -)>
12. <6, (17, 7, 4)>
13. <7, (6, - , -)>
14. <11, (2, 19, -)>
15. <9, (3, - , -)>
16. <14, (17, 18, 5)>
17. <16, (2, 5, 18)>
18. <1, (8, 12, 10)>
19. <10, (1, - , -)>
20. <13, (17, - , -)>

So there are a total of [20] 3-stars in the graph.
