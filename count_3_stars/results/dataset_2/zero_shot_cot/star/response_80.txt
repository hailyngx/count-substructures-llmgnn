Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that are connected in a star pattern.

Let's list the 3-stars found in the graph:
<6, (9, 5, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 11)>
<1, (3, 11, 5)>
<3, (1, 8, 12)>
<10, (6, 12, 14)>
<11, (9, 1, 5)>
<4, (11, 7, 12)>
<7, (6, 4, 13)>
<8, (9, 3, 5)>
<5, (6, 1, 11)>
<0, (4, 8, 14)>
<14, (10, 4, 0)>
<12, (3, 10, 11)>
<2, (0, 14, 13)>
<13, (6, 9, 7)>

Now counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we get a total of [15].
