Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 23) (8, 5) (23, 8) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 16) (23, 6) (19, 17) (26, 22) (26, 15) (26, 11) (22, 26) (22, 11) (22, 21) (9, 21) (9, 24) (0, 21) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 20) (7, 1) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 28) (20, 7) (20, 29) (16, 23) (16, 12) (16, 29) (16, 2) (28, 17) (28, 27) (28, 15) (13, 17) (13, 27) (29, 7) (29, 20) (29, 16) (14, 4) (14, 24) (14, 25) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 27) (12, 16) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 5) (15, 26) (15, 28) (15, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 4) (21, 22) (21, 9) (21, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (1, 23) (1, 7) (1, 25) (25, 14) (25, 1) (25, 18) (27, 28) (27, 13) (27, 2) (27, 24) (24, 9) (24, 14) (24, 27) (6, 23) (6, 15) (6, 18) (10, 3) (10, 4) (11, 26) (11, 22) (11, 0) (11, 12) (18, 25) (18, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify the nodes that can be central nodes of 3-stars based on the definition. 

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 23 (connected to 8, 17, 1)
- Node 16 (connected to 23, 12, 29)
- Node 17 (connected to 23, 19, 13)
These are the central nodes in the graph.

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<23, (8, 17, 1)>
<16, (23, 12, 29)>
<17, (23, 19, 13)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
