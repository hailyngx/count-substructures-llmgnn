Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 0) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 3) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 0) (7, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 17) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 14) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (17, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's check each node to see if it is the center of a 3-star. 

- Node 0: (0, 4, 18) and (0, 3, 18)
- Node 1: (1, 5, 15) and (1, 6, 19)
- Node 2: (2, 9, 15) and (2, 17, 12)
- Node 3: (3, 0, 12) and (3, 5, 12)
- Node 4: (4, 8, 18) and (4, 12, 15)
- Node 5: (5, 1, 15) and (5, 13, 16)
- Node 6: (6, 1, 19) and (6, 4, 19)
- Node 7: No 3-star
- Node 8: (8, 4, 18)
- Node 9: (9, 2, 15) and (9, 11, 14)
- Node 10: (10, 7, 15) and (10, 11, 15)
- Node 11: (11, 9, 10)
- Node 12: (12, 4, 15) and (12, 3, 16)
- Node 13: (13, 5, 16)
- Node 14: (14, 9, 19) and (14, 18, 19)
- Node 15: (15, 1, 5) and (15, 2, 10)
- Node 16: (16, 13, 18) and (16, 12, 3)
- Node 17: (17, 2, 12)
- Node 18: (18, 8, 4) and (18, 0, 16)
- Node 19: (19, 1, 6) and (19, 14, 6)

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (4, 18, 3)>
<1, (5, 15, 6)>
<2, (15, 9, 10)>
<3, (0, 12, 4)>
<4, (8, 18, 4)>
<5, (15, 1, 13)>
<6, (1, 19, 5)>
<9, (14, 19, 18)>
<10, (7, 15, 11)>
<12, (3, 16, 12)>
<13, (16, 18, 5)>
<14, (19, 9, 14)>
<16, (4, 12, 15)>
<17, (12, 2, 17)>
