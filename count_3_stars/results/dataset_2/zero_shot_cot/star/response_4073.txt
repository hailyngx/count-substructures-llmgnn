Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 13) (3, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 13) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 9) (17, 11) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 1) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 11) (11, 14) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 9) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 1) (18, 6) (4, 16) (4, 10) (9, 17) (9, 12) (9, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 4) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Let's go through each node and its adjacent nodes:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 16.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 6, and 18.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 10.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 13, 15, and 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 10 and 16.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 11, and 18.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 12, and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 16.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 17.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 13.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 9, 14, and 17.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 7, 9, and 19.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 10, 14, and 15.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 17.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 3 and 17.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 19.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 9, 11, 14, and 15.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 12, 16, and 18. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars we found:

<0, (1, 7, 16)>
<1, (0, 6, 18)>
<2, (6, 8, 10)>
<3, (13, 15, 18)>
<4, (10, 16, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 18)>
<7, (0, 12, 19)>
<8, (2, 16, 8)>
<9, (11, 12, 17)>
<10, (2, 4, 13)>
<11, (6, 9, 17)>
<12, (7, 9, 19)>
<13, (3, 14, 15)>
<14, (11, 13, 17)>
<15, (3, 13, 17)>
<16, (0, 4, 8)>
<17, (9, 11, 14)>
<18, (1, 3, 6)>
<19, (12, 16, 18)>

Counting the number of 3-stars: [19]
