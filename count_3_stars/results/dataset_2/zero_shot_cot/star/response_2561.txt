Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 5) (16, 11) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 19) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (17, 9) (17, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 7) (15, 10) (15, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (1, 11) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 4) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 15) (19, 7) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 13) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 4) (18, 14) 

Response:
Let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph:

<11, (16, 10, 1)>
<11, (5, 16, 10)>
<11, (1, 5, 7)>
<11, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (9, 2, 11)>
<5, (2, 9, 4)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
<9, (8, 17, 5)>
<9, (17, 19, 10)>
<10, (15, 6, 11)>
<10, (15, 19, 6)>
<10, (6, 17, 11)>
<17, (10, 19, 9)>
<0, (13, 8, 12)>
<14, (18, 7, 1)>
<15, (19, 7, 10)>
<8, (6, 0, 9)>
<1, (7, 14, 11)>
<6, (4, 8, 10)>
<2, (4, 12, 5)>
<12, (8, 2, 13)>
<19, (15, 7, 10)>
<3, (7, 12, 13)>
<4, (6, 2, 9)>
<13, (0, 4, 12)>
<18, (14, 7, 0)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].
