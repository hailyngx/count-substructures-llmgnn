Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 24) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 24) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 24) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 18) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 26) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 12) (17, 20) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 27) (20, 17) (20, 26) (1, 15) (1, 8) (29, 9) (29, 19) (29, 21) (13, 0) (13, 17) (13, 21) (25, 9) (25, 17) (25, 27) (25, 18) (27, 3) (27, 17) (27, 25) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 10) (21, 29) (21, 13) (21, 16) (21, 2) (21, 24) (8, 1) (8, 22) (10, 4) (10, 16) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 23) (26, 2) (19, 15) (19, 29) (19, 11) (11, 7) (11, 19) (22, 8) (23, 4) (23, 27) (23, 26) (2, 21) (2, 26) (24, 5) (24, 9) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 21) (18, 7) (18, 25) (18, 12) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all possible 3-stars.
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<5, (6, 9, 14)>
<9, (5, 24, 29)>
<3, (12, 15, 27)>
<15, (1, 19, 24)>
<4, (6, 7, 10)>
<7, (0, 11, 24)>
<6, (4, 5, 26)>
<0, (7, 13, 24)>
<14, (5, 12, 18)>
<17, (13, 20, 27)>
<20, (17, 26, 27)>
<1, (8, 15, 29)>
<29, (19, 21, 9)>
<13, (0, 17, 21)>
<25, (17, 27, 9)>
<27, (3, 25, 17)>
<16, (10, 21, 16)>
<21, (2, 13, 29)>
<8, (1, 22, 8)>
<10, (16, 4, 10)>
<26, (2, 6, 20)>
<19, (11, 15, 29)>
<11, (7, 19, 11)>
<22, (8, 22, 8)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
