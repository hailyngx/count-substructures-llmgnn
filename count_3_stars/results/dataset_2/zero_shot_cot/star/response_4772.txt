Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 8) (15, 24) (15, 21) (27, 4) (27, 23) (4, 27) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (23, 27) (23, 1) (23, 9) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 1) (20, 0) (20, 24) (21, 15) (21, 10) (21, 9) (21, 11) (28, 26) (28, 8) (28, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 21) (11, 3) (11, 24) (11, 2) (26, 28) (26, 18) (26, 8) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 24) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 6) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 26) (18, 5) (10, 7) (10, 21) (10, 19) (12, 4) (12, 17) (12, 25) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (25, 12) (25, 14) (25, 17) (25, 8) (13, 17) (13, 16) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 25) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 16) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 16) (16, 3) (16, 13) (16, 24) (16, 6) (1, 23) (1, 0) (2, 11) (9, 4) (9, 23) (9, 21) (29, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<4, (27, 7, 12)>
<5, (28, 19, 24)>
<6, (19, 17, 16)>
<7, (4, 10, 18)>
<8, (15, 28, 25)>
<9, (21, 23, 4)>
<10, (7, 19, 21)>
<11, (21, 3, 24)>
<12, (17, 25, 4)>
<13, (17, 16, 13)>
<14, (25, 29, 14)>
<15, (8, 24, 21)>
<16, (3, 6, 24)>
<17, (0, 25, 6)>
<18, (5, 26, 18)>
<19, (5, 10, 6)>
<20, (0, 24, 20)>
<21, (9, 15, 10)>
<22, (11, 21, 2)>
<23, (27, 1, 9)>
<24, (15, 20, 11)>
<25, (8, 12, 17)>
<26, (8, 28, 18)>
<27, (4, 23, 9)>
<28, (5, 26, 8)>
<29, (14, 25, 29)>

Since each unique 3-star contributes 1 to the total count, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].
