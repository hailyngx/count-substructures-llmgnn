Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 28) (27, 25) (27, 29) (27, 13) (4, 22) (4, 9) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 29) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 8) (29, 27) (29, 3) (29, 19) (6, 3) (6, 28) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 16) (28, 15) (28, 6) (28, 20) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 11) (25, 27) (25, 0) (14, 26) (14, 21) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 16) (22, 4) (22, 20) (10, 26) (10, 18) (10, 20) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 24) (5, 7) (5, 2) (24, 3) (24, 2) (24, 19) (24, 21) (18, 10) (18, 23) (18, 0) (18, 8) (23, 18) (23, 0) (9, 4) (19, 29) (19, 24) (19, 16) (16, 6) (16, 13) (16, 26) (16, 19) (0, 6) (0, 25) (0, 18) (0, 23) (8, 17) (8, 18) (8, 20) (20, 28) (20, 22) (20, 10) (20, 8) (11, 13) (11, 21) (11, 12) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 11) (21, 14) (21, 24) (21, 11) 

Response:
Since each 3-star has a center and 3 leaves, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly thee other nodes.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 3: (1, 2, 24)
- Node 6: (0, 12, 28)
- Node 10: (18, 20, 26)
- Node 13: (11, 16, 17)
- Node 15: (7, 12, 28)
- Node 16: (6, 13, 19)
- Node 18: (0, 8, 10)
- Node 20: (8, 10, 28)
- Node 21: (11, 14, 24)
- Node 24: (2, 3, 19)
- Node 26: (10, 14, 16)
- Node 29: (3, 19, 27)

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<3, (1, 2, 24)>
<6, (0, 12, 28)>
<10, (18, 20, 26)>
<13, (11, 16, 17)>
<15, (7, 12, 28)>
<16, (6, 13, 19)>
<18, (0, 8, 10)>
<20, (8, 10, 28)>
<21, (11, 14, 24)>
<24, (2, 3, 19)>
<26, (10, 14, 16)>
<29, (3, 19, 27)>

So, there are a total of [12] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
