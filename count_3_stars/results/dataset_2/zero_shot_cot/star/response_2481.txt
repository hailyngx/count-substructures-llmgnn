Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 6) (4, 21) (7, 23) (7, 17) (27, 5) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 6) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 22) (25, 14) (25, 10) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 24) (6, 4) (6, 20) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 17) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 3) (14, 25) (14, 24) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 12) (26, 1) (26, 15) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 3) (11, 18) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (17, 16) (17, 15) (9, 20) (9, 21) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 18) (19, 22) (19, 29) (19, 12) (22, 25) (22, 19) (22, 21) (12, 1) (12, 19) (12, 23) (16, 27) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 24) (15, 26) (15, 17) (24, 5) (24, 14) (24, 16) (21, 4) (21, 9) (21, 22) (21, 29) (29, 19) (29, 21) (29, 13) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 23) (18, 11) (18, 3) (13, 2) (13, 28) (13, 29) (23, 7) (23, 12) (23, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

We notice that for a 3-star:
- The center node is connected to exactly three leaves.
- The leaves are not connected to each other.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the given graph:

<4, (6, 20, 21)>
<5, (6, 8, 24)>
<6, (4, 5, 28)>
<7, (17, 23, 27)>
<8, (5, 16, 3)>
<9, (20, 21, 29)>
<10, (1, 3, 23)>
<11, (20, 28, 3)>
<12, (1, 19, 23)>
<13, (2, 28, 29)>
<14, (24, 25, 16)>
<15, (26, 17, 15)>
<17, (7, 15, 16)>
<18, (3, 11, 2)>
<19, (12, 22, 29)>
<20, (6, 11, 25)>
<21, (4, 9, 22)>
<22, (25, 21, 19)>
<23, (7, 10, 12)>
<24, (5, 14, 16)>
<25, (20, 14, 10)>
<26, (1, 15, 26)>
<27, (5, 16, 27)>
<28, (6, 13, 11)>
<29, (19, 13, 21)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we have found 26 unique 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
