Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 7) (10, 17) (10, 3) (10, 8) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 11) (2, 13) (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 3) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 16) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 6) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 1) (11, 17) (11, 1) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 5) (14, 8) (15, 7) (16, 4) (16, 8) (6, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<10, (7, 17, 8)>
<17, (10, 13, 12)>
<13, (17, 2, 0)>
<12, (17, 13, 0)>
<11, (17, 1, 1)>
<0, (13, 12, 3)>
<1, (4, 5, 11)>
<3, (10, 2, 0)>
<5, (1, 14, 19)>
<7, (4, 15, 8)>
<8, (7, 10, 14)>
<4, (7, 18, 1)>
<18, (4, 9, 3)>

Therefore, there are a total of [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
