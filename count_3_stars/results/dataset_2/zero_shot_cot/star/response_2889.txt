Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 12) (18, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 2) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 13) (19, 5) (19, 0) (19, 15) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 17) (13, 15) (10, 15) (15, 9) (15, 19) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 16) (12, 18) (12, 8) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 2) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (7, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 7) (2, 14) (2, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Here are the 3-stars in the graph:
<4, (9, 13, 17)>
<5, (1, 11, 19)>
<6, (0, 14, 5)>
<9, (4, 13, 15)>
<11, (5, 7, 8)>
<13, (9, 15, 17)>
<14, (1, 2, 6)>
<15, (9, 13, 16)>
<16, (2, 15, 18)>
<17, (1, 13, 4)>
<18, (3, 12, 16)>
<19, (0, 5, 15)>

Count of 3-stars: [12]
