Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 6) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 14) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 9) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- For node 0: 
  - <0, (4, 1, 3)>
  - <0, (4, 10, 14)>
- For node 1: 
  - <1, (3, 9, 13)>
- For node 2: 
  - <2, (3, 6, 13)>
- For node 3: 
  - <3, (1, 0, 6)>
- For node 4: 
  - <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- For node 5: 
  - <5, (4, 7, 14)>
- For node 6: 
  - <6, (3, 2, 13)>
- For node 7: 
  - <7, (5, 9, 12)>
- For node 8: 
  - <8, (6, 11, 4)>
- For node 9: 
  - <9, (4, 7, 13)>
- For node 10: 
  - <10, (0, 7, 13)>
- For node 11: 
  - <11, (8, 6, 10)>
- For node 12: 
  - <12, (7, 3, 11)>
- For node 13: 
  - <13, (1, 10, 2)>
- For node 14: 
  - <14, (0, 2, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph [=15].
