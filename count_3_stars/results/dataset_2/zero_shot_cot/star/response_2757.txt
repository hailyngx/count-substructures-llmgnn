Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

The central nodes with exactly three connections (forming a 3-star) are: 6, 9, 4, 8, 5, 0, 2, 1, 3, 7.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by focusing on each central node:
- Node 6: <6, (9, 1, 7)>
- Node 9: <9, (6, 8, 4)>
- Node 4: <4, (9, 8, 0)>
- Node 8: <8, (9, 4, 5)>
- Node 5: <5, (8, 0, 3)>
- Node 0: <0, (6, 4, 5)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 0, 7)>
- Node 1: <1, (6, 9, 4)>
- Node 3: <3, (9, 5, 7)>
- Node 7: <7, (6, 8, 2)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
