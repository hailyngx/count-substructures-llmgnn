Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 2) (19, 5) (19, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (15, 5) (15, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (17, 2) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 7) (0, 17) (0, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 16) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 8) (8, 17) (8, 16) (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 1) (12, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify nodes that form 3-stars. 

Starting from node 0 and going up to node 19, checking each node:

Node 0: (0, 17) (0, 4) - No 3-star
Node 1: (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) - 1 unique 3-star <1, (6, 14, 12)>
Node 2: (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 17) - 1 unique 3-star <2, (18, 16, 17)>
Node 3: (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 14) - No 3-star
Node 4: (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 16) - 1 unique 3-star <4, (9, 10, 16)>
Node 5: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) - 1 unique 3-star <5, (9, 19, 15)>
Node 6: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) - 1 unique 3-star <6, (9, 1, 14)>
Node 7: (7, 6) (7, 17) (7, 3) - No 3-star
Node 8: (8, 17) (8, 16) - No 3-star
Node 9: (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 12) - 1 unique 3-star <9, (5, 6, 4)>
Node 10: (10, 11) (10, 4) - No 3-star
Node 11: (11, 10) (11, 15) - No 3-star
Node 12: (12, 9) (12, 19) (12, 1) (12, 14) - 1 unique 3-star <12, (9, 19, 1)>
Node 13: (13, 16) (13, 14) - No 3-star
Node 14: (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 12) - 1 unique 3-star <14, (6, 1, 13)>
Node 15: (15, 5) (15, 11) - No 3-star
Node 16: (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (16, 8) - 1 unique 3-star <16, (2, 13, 4)>
Node 17: (17, 2) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 7) - 1 unique 3-star <17, (2, 0, 8)>
Node 18: (18, 2) - No 3-star
Node 19: (19, 5) (19, 12) - No 3-star

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (6, 14, 12)>, <2, (18, 16, 17)>, <4, (9, 10, 16)>, <5, (9, 19, 15)>, <6, (9, 1, 14)>
