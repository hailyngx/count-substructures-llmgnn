Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
To determine the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 2. 
   - Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 3.
   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 0.
   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 0.
   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 0.
   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 0.

2. Count the unique 3-stars:
   - There are 6 unique 3-stars:
     - <6, (9, 7, 2)>
     - <9, (6, 2, 3)>
     - <1, (9, 5, 0)>
     - <3, (9, 7, 0)>
     - <4, (6, 2, 0)>
     - <8, (1, 7, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
