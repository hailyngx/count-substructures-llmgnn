Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and the nodes connected to them. 

From the given edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <5, (9, 6, 2)>
2. <9, (5, 6, 8)>
3. <6, (5, 9, 2)>
4. <4, (9, 8, 1)>
5. <7, (1, 8, 1)>
6. <1, (5, 4, 7)>
7. <3, (5, 9, 1)>
8. <8, (9, 4, 7)>
9. <2, (5, 3, 8)>
10. <0, (1, 8, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
