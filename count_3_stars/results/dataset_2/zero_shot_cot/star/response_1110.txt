Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure.

Nodes with 3 edges:
- Node 1: (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 7)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 0), (3, 9)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 2), (8, 9), (8, 0)
- Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 8), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 0)

Next, let's count the 3-stars by checking the connections of the central nodes:

- Node 1 forms 2 3-stars: <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 8 forms 2 3-stars: <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (3, 4, 7)>

Overall, there are [6] 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>.
