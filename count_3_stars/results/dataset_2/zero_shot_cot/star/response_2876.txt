Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 26) (2, 29) (2, 26) (2, 1) (29, 2) (29, 16) (29, 14) (29, 24) (29, 3) (3, 29) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 13) (25, 3) (25, 16) (25, 22) (25, 18) (14, 29) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 26) (8, 13) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 9) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 22) (0, 3) (20, 7) (20, 23) (20, 28) (7, 20) (12, 10) (26, 27) (26, 2) (26, 17) (26, 28) (26, 4) (28, 20) (28, 26) (28, 4) (21, 19) (21, 5) (21, 22) (5, 14) (5, 21) (5, 19) (19, 21) (19, 5) (4, 14) (4, 26) (4, 28) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 23) (6, 1) (6, 18) (11, 14) (11, 18) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 1) (16, 15) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 17) (16, 22) (24, 15) (24, 29) (22, 25) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 16) (18, 27) (18, 25) (18, 6) (18, 11) (9, 13) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<15, (27, 23, 24)>
<27, (15, 18, 26)>
<2, (29, 26, 1)>
<29, (2, 16, 24)>
<3, (29, 25, 0)>
<25, (3, 16, 22, 18)>
<14, (29, 17, 11, 4, 5)>
<17, (14, 10, 16, 26)>
<13, (3, 8, 9)>
<10, (17, 12, 22)>
<20, (7, 23, 28)>
<7, (20)>
<12, (10)>
<26, (27, 2, 17, 28, 4)>
<21, (19, 5, 22)>
<5, (14, 21, 19)>
<19, (21, 5)>
<4, (14, 26, 28)>
<1, (2, 6, 23)>
<6, (1, 18)>
<11, (14, 18)>
<23, (15, 20, 1)>
<16, (15, 29, 25, 17, 22)>
<24, (15, 29)>
<22, (25, 10, 21, 16)>
<18, (27, 25, 6, 11)>
<9, (13)>

There are a total of 26 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
