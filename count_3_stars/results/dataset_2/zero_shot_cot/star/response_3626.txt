Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star. 

Nodes with degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 4
- Node 1 has degree 6
- Node 2 has degree 4
- Node 3 has degree 3
- Node 4 has degree 6
- Node 5 has degree 6
- Node 6 has degree 4
- Node 7 has degree 4
- Node 8 has degree 4
- Node 9 has degree 2

Let's list the possible 3-stars:
- Node 1 can be the central node in 4 unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 4 can be the central node in 1 unique 3-star: <4, (5, 1, 6)>
- Node 5 can be the central node in 3 unique 3-stars: <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 2)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>
- Node 6 can be the central node in 2 unique 3-stars: <6, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 7 can be the central node in 2 unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 0)>, <7, (1, 6, 5)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12]. 
Inside brackets, the unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 3, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 4)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <4, (5, 1, 6)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 2)>, <5, (1, 8, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 2)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 0)>, <7, (1, 6, 5)>.
