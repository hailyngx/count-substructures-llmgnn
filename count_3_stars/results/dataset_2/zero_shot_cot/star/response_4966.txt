Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are multiple steps involved in solving this problem. Let's start by identifying the 3-star configurations:

1. Node 4 is the center, connected to nodes 8, 5, and 1: <4, (8, 5, 1)>
2. Node 8 is the center, connected to nodes 4, 9, and 0: <8, (4, 9, 0)>
3. Node 6, and 7 do not form any 3-star configurations.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
