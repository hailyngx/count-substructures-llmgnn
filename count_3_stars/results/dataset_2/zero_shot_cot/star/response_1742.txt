Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 13) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the central nodes with exactly 3 leaves connected to them. Then, we can calculate how many 3-stars exist in total.

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<4, (5, 14, 3)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 12)>
<9, (6, 8, 11)>
<12, (6, 2, 0)>
<8, (5, 9, 11)>
<0, (12, 5, 13)>
<14, (4, 7, 9)>
<13, (12, 0, 14)>
<11, (9, 5, 8)>
<1, (8, 0, 11)>
<10, (3, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
