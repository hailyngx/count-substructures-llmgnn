Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 23) (5, 10) (9, 18) (9, 2) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 8) (15, 1) (15, 26) (18, 9) (18, 26) (18, 0) (18, 29) (22, 14) (22, 11) (22, 24) (22, 1) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 10) (27, 12) (27, 29) (0, 18) (0, 20) (0, 17) (0, 19) (20, 3) (20, 0) (20, 7) (20, 13) (6, 28) (6, 16) (28, 6) (28, 14) (28, 2) (13, 20) (13, 4) (13, 11) (26, 15) (26, 18) (26, 25) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 25) (1, 15) (1, 22) (1, 19) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 21) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 27) (29, 11) (4, 12) (4, 13) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 23) (24, 22) (24, 16) (24, 8) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 10) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 14) (21, 8) (19, 0) (19, 1) (19, 25) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 23) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 29) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the central nodes and their connected nodes. A 3-star consists of a central node and three leaves connected to it. Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (18, 20, 19)>
<1, (15, 22, 19)>
<2, (5, 9, 23)>
<3, (17, 20, 8)>
<4, (12, 13, 10)>
<6, (28, 16, 7)>
<7, (20, 17, 14)>
<8, (3, 1, 24)>
<11, (22, 13, 29)>
<14, (22, 28, 7)>
<15, (1, 26, 25)>
<16, (6, 24, 25)>
<18, (9, 26, 29)>
<19, (0, 1, 25)>
<20, (3, 0, 7)>
<22, (14, 1, 11)>
<23, (5, 2, 10)>
<24, (8, 22, 16)>
<25, (26, 19, 16)>
<26, (15, 18, 25)>
<28, (6, 2, 14)>
<29, (18, 11, 27)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars.
