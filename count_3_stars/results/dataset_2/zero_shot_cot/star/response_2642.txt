Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the possible 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Then we check if each potential 3-star configuration is actually present in the graph.

Here are the steps to find the 3-stars:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 10.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 8, 11, and 13.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 3, and 1.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 5, 11, and 6.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 10.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 2.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 8, and 3.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 14.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 7, 2, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 8.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 0.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 13.

2. We only consider the configurations where a node is the center and the other three nodes are its neighbors.

3. Counting the actual 3-stars:
- The 3-star configurations found in the graph are: 
<5, (8, 12, 10)>, 
<9, (8, 11, 13)>,
<4, (5, 7, 12)>,
<7, (4, 3, 1)>,
<10, (5, 11, 6)>,
<11, (9, 4, 10)>,
<2, (10, 8, 1)>,
<8, (5, 9, 2)>,
<14,Â (11, 8, 3)>,
<12, (5, 9, 4)>,
<3, (4, 7, 14)>,
<1, (7, 2, 12)>,
<6, (10, 11, 8)>,
<13, (9, 7, 0)>.

Count of 3-stars: [14]
