Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 7) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 24) (15, 28) (27, 17) (27, 9) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 11) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 19) (23, 12) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (18, 20) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 3) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 7) (1, 26) (1, 24) (26, 1) (26, 16) (26, 7) (11, 25) (11, 23) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 9) (24, 15) (24, 1) (4, 10) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 20) (17, 6) (29, 20) (29, 18) (29, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 21) (21, 10) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 14) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 7) (9, 27) (9, 25) (9, 28) (9, 0) (19, 25) (19, 23) (19, 14) (14, 12) (14, 19) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 26) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central nodes (centers) in the given graph. Central nodes will have exactly 3 edges connected to them. We note down these central nodes with their respective adjacent nodes.

Central nodes:
- Node 13 (Connected to nodes 22, 7, 6)
- Node 15 (Connected to nodes 6, 17, 24)
- Node 18 (Connected to nodes 20, 2, 29)
- Node 25 (Connected to nodes 20, 9, 19)
- Node 20 (Connected to nodes 25, 17, 29)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars and list them:

<13, (22, 7, 6)>
<15, (6, 17, 24)>
<18, (20, 2, 29)>
<25, (20, 9, 19)>
<20, (25, 17, 29)>
