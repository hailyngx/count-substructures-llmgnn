Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 16) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 18) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 13) (11, 0) (11, 13) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 15) (18, 8) 

Response:
There are two 3-stars in the given graph. 
The unique 3-stars are <3, (15, 7, 4)> and <8, (17, 2, 18)>.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
