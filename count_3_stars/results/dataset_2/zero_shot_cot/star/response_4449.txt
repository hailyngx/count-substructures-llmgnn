Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 19) (16, 15) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 13) (13, 16) (13, 5) (13, 17) (9, 8) (9, 1) (17, 13) (19, 16) (19, 14) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 15) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (3, 0) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 6) (18, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10) 

Response:
Let's analyze the 3-star graphs in the given graph:
1. Node 11 forms two 3-stars: <11, (16, 1, 18)> and <11, (4, 15, 18)>
2. Node 16 forms two 3-stars: <16, (11, 1, 13)> and <16, (19, 15, 11)>
3. Node 7 forms one 3-star: <7, (12, 6, 15)>
4. Node 12 forms one 3-star: <12, (7, 2, 10)>
5. Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (12, 5, 14)>
6. Node 14 forms one 3-star: <14, (2, 0, 6)>
7. Node 5 forms one 3-star: <5, (7, 2, 13)>
8. Node 13 forms one 3-star: <13, (16, 5, 17)>
9. Node 9 forms one 3-star: <9, (8, 1, 17)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
