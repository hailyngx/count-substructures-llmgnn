Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 18) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 9) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 18) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 2) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 15) (4, 1) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated by traversing through each node and checking if it has exactly 3 edges connected to it. 

Let's start by listing the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (6, 14, 19)>
<3, (5, 14, 16)>
<6, (2, 10, 17)>
<7, (9, 10, 18)>
<8, (12, 13, 18)>
<9, (7, 15, 19)>
<10, (6, 7, 10)>
<13, (0, 8, 14)>
<14, (2, 13, 15)>
<15, (9, 14, 15)>
<16, (0, 3, 16)>
<18, (0, 7, 12)>
<19, (5, 9, 18)>

Counting these unique 3-stars, we get a total of [13] 3-stars in the graph.
