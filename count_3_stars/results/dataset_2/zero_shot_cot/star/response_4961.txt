Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 26) (3, 22) (7, 17) (21, 28) (21, 11) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 28) (11, 21) (11, 29) (11, 20) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 17) (8, 29) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 15) (26, 3) (26, 10) (26, 19) (26, 29) (28, 21) (28, 10) (28, 4) (28, 14) (5, 18) (5, 29) (13, 16) (13, 20) (25, 27) (25, 14) (25, 24) (25, 2) (27, 9) (27, 10) (27, 25) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (16, 13) (16, 0) (16, 18) (2, 10) (2, 25) (2, 22) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 17) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 16) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 14) (14, 28) (14, 25) (14, 15) (23, 1) (23, 15) (29, 11) (29, 8) (29, 26) (29, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 24) (24, 25) (24, 22) (24, 12) (24, 20) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 0) (17, 22) (20, 11) (20, 13) (20, 24) 

Response:
Let's first identify the center nodes and their neighboring nodes in the graph:

1. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 19, 26, and 22.
2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 4, and 27.
3. Node 10 is connected to nodes 26, 27, 2, and 28.
4. Node 11 is connected to nodes 21, 29, and 20.
5. Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 0, and 24.
6. Node 14 is connected to nodes 28, 25, and 15.
7. Node 16 is connected to nodes 13, 0, and 18.
8. Node 17 is connected to nodes 7, 4, 0, and 22.
9. Node 20 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 24.
10. Node 22 is connected to nodes 3, 2, 24, and 17.
11. Node 25 is connected to nodes 27, 14, 24, and 2.
12. Node 28 is connected to nodes 21, 10, 4, and 14.
13. Node 29 is connected to nodes 11, 8, 26, and 5.

From the connections above, we can see the 3-stars are as follows:

<3, (1, 19, 26)>
<9, (6, 4, 27)>
<10, (26, 27, 2)>
<11, (21, 29, 20)>
<12, (6, 0, 24)>
<14, (28, 25, 15)>
<16, (13, 0, 18)>
<17, (7, 4, 0)>
<20, (11, 13, 24)>
<22, (3, 2, 24)>
<25, (27, 14, 24)>
<28, (21, 10, 4)>
<29, (11, 8, 26)>

Therefore, there are [13] 3-stars in the given graph.
