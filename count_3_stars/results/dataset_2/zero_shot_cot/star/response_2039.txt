Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 1) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 13) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 13) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 13) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 13) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 1) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming 3-stars.
From the edge list provided, we can see the following 3-stars:
- <4, (7, 8, 5)>
- <10, (11, 0, 14)>
- <11, (4, 10, 6)>
- <8, (4, 9, 12)>
- <12, (8, 6, 9)>
- <0, (7, 10, 11)>
- <9, (8, 12, 14)>
- <13, (10, 0, 9)>
- <14, (4, 10, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 5)>
- <5, (4, 3, 2)>
- <1, (8, 2, 13)>
- <6, (11, 12, 2)>

Counting the total number of unique 3-stars: [13]
