Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 10) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 12) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 12) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.

First, we identify all nodes that are the center of a 3-star. These nodes need to have exactly three neighboring nodes. 

The following nodes are centers of potential 3-stars with their neighbors listed in parentheses:
- Node 5: (8, 3, 10)
- Node 9: (6, 8, 13)
- Node 6: (9, 1, 7)
- Node 4: (10, 14, 11)
- Node 7: (6, 3, 2)
- Node 8: (5, 9, 2)
- Node 13: (9, 7, 10)
- Node 2: (7, 8, 12)
- Node 3: (5, 4, 7)
- Node 11: (4, 3, 12)
- Node 1: (6, 10, 0)
- Node 12: (6, 2, 11)
- Node 14: (4, 2, 3)
- Node 10: (5, 4, 13)
- Node 0: (9, 6, 8)

Next, we'll check each potential 3-star center to see if they have exactly three neighbors between them. 

After checking all the combinations, we find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (8, 3, 10)>
<9, (6, 8, 13)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<4, (10, 14, 11)>
<7, (6, 3, 2)>
<8, (5, 9, 2)>
<13, (9, 7, 10)>
<2, (7, 8, 12)>
<3, (5, 4, 7)>
<11, (4, 3, 12)>
<1, (6, 10, 0)>
<12, (6, 2, 11)>
<14, (4, 2, 3)>
<10, (5, 4, 13)>
<0, (9, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
