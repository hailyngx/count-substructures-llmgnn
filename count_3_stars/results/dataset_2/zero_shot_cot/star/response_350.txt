Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star. 
Based on the given edges, the potential central nodes are 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, 6, 7, and 4. 

Now, we will list all 3-stars:

<5, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (6, 8, 4)>
<3, (5, 1, 7)>
<8, (5, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (6, 2, 1)>

Now count the total number of 3-stars found in the given graph.
There are [7] 3-stars.
