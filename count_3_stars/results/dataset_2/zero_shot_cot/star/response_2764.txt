Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars. We can do this by looking at each edge and identifying nodes that have exactly three incident edges.

The nodes that fit this criteria are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. 

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph. We need to look for nodes that are directly connected to these center nodes. 

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by analyzing the connections:

[<0, (5, 4, 6)>, <1, (11, 12, 2)>, <2, (1, 13, 12)>, <4, (11, 8, 12)>, <5, (0, 14, -)>, <6, (10, 0, 12)>, <9, (8, 14, 13)>, <10, (11, 0, 6)>, <11, (10, 4, 2)>, <12, (9, 4, 6)>, <13, (10, 9, 2)>, <14, (9, 0, 7)>]

By counting the unique 3-stars found, we get the final answer:

[12]
