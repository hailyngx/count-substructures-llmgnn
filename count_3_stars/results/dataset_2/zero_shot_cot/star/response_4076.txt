Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 11) (13, 9) (22, 10) (15, 27) (15, 26) (15, 23) (15, 7) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 21) (27, 16) (18, 7) (18, 28) (3, 25) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (25, 3) (25, 16) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 20) (1, 24) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 7) (20, 1) (20, 16) (21, 27) (21, 10) (24, 1) (24, 26) (24, 6) (24, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 2) (17, 1) (17, 9) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 3) (7, 0) (5, 19) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 16) (26, 15) (26, 24) (26, 28) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 17) (29, 5) (29, 8) (10, 22) (10, 21) (10, 28) (8, 24) (8, 19) (8, 29) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 24) (6, 8) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 5) (23, 15) (28, 18) (28, 14) (28, 26) (28, 10) (2, 15) (2, 14) (2, 19) (16, 27) (16, 25) (16, 20) (16, 5) (16, 19) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 15 as the center:
   <15, (2, 7, 26)>
   <15, (7, 18, 27)>

2. Node 1 as the center:
   <1, (3, 20, 24)>

3. Node 27 as the center:
   <27, (12, 15, 21)>

4. Node 24 as the center:
   <24, (1, 6, 26)>

5. Node 14 as the center:
   <14, (0, 11, 28)>

6. Node 5 as the center:
   <5, (8, 16, 19)>
   <5, (11, 16, 29)>

7. Node 8 as the center:
   <8, (6, 19, 29)>
   <8, (24, 6, 29)>

8. Node 3 as the center:
   <3, (1, 6, 7)>
   <3, (7, 6, 25)>

9. Node 9 as the center:
   <9, (12, 13, 17)>

10. Node 10 as the center:
   <10, (21, 22, 28)>

Counting all unique 3-stars, we find a total of [10].
