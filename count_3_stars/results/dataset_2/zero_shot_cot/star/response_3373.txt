Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 4) 

Response:
First, we identify the 3-star structures in the graph:

<5, (8, 0, 7)>
<6, (7, 3, 2)>
<2, (8, 4, 6)>
<8, (5, 2, 9)>
<9, (8, 0, 4)>
<3, (6, 7, 4)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (5, 9, 8)>
<4, (6, 9, 3)>
<1, (5, 7, 4)>

Next, we count the number of unique 3-star structures:
[10]
