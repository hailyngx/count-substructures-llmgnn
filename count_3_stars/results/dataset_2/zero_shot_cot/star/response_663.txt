Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 7) (9, 19) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 17) (3, 17) (3, 10) (0, 16) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 18) (7, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 1) (19, 9) (19, 5) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 4) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 12) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 15) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (4, 13) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first need to identify all groups of 3 nodes that form a 3-star configuration. 

Let's list the 3-stars in the graph:
<9, (6, 18, 7)>
<7, (2, 0, 18)>
<12, (8, 13, 5)>
<1, (5, 15, 4)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars by taking into account each unique 3-star found:
[4]
