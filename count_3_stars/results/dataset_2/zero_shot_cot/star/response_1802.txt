Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph given, we will look for nodes that are directly connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star around them.

Starting from node 0:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 4. It has 4 neighbors, but it is not part of a 3-star.

Moving on to node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 6. It has 4 neighbors, but it is not part of a 3-star.

Next, node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 9. It has 5 neighbors, but it is not part of a 3-star.

Moving on to node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, and 9. It has 5 neighbors, but it is not part of a 3-star.

Next, node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8. It has 6 neighbors, forming a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 2)>.

Moving on to node 5:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. It has 6 neighbors, forming a 3-star: <5, (1, 4, 7)>.

Continuing to node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5. It has 3 neighbors, but it is not part of a 3-star.

Next, node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5. It has 3 neighbors, forming a 3-star: <7, (3, 4, 5)>.

Moving on to node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. It has 2 neighbors, but it is not part of a 3-star.

Lastly, node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 3. It has 2 neighbors, but it is not part of a 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, and <7, (3, 4, 5)>.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
