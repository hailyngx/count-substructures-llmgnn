Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<2, (5, 1, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 2, 8)>
<8, (7, 2, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
