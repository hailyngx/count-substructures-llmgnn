Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for any node that has exactly three edges connected to it, forming a 3-star pattern.

By counting, we find the following nodes with three edges each:
- Node 5 has 5 edges (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3)
- Node 9 has 3 edges (9, 6), (9, 2), (9, 7)
- Node 6 has 5 edges (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 0)
- Node 4 has 2 edges (4, 5), (4, 3)
- Node 8 has 4 edges (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 1)
- Node 2 has 4 edges (2, 5), (2, 9), (2, 0), (2, 3)
- Node 0 has 4 edges (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 7), (0, 1)
- Node 7 has 5 edges (7, 9), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 0), (7, 3)
- Node 1 has 4 edges (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 0)
- Node 3 has 4 edges (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 2), (3, 7)

Based on the above, we can count the number of 3-stars in the graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (2, 8, 1)>
<6, (9, 1, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<7, (9, 6, 0)>
<2, (9, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [5].
