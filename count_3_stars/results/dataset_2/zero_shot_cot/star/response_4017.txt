- Node 19: connected to nodes 2, 4, 14, 23
- Node 20: connected to node 7
- Node 21: connected to nodes 6, 16, 28
- Node 23: connected to nodes 0, 11, 19
- Node 24: connected to nodes 16, 17, 9
- Node 25: connected to nodes 8, 13, 15
- Node 26: connected to node 1
- Node 27: connected to nodes 5, 9, 10, 11, 28
- Node 28: connected to nodes 3, 7, 18, 21, 27
- Node 29: connected to nodes 1, 0, 11, 12

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Central Node: 14, Leaves: 17, 19, 15 <14, (17, 19, 15)>
- Central Node: 17, Leaves: 14, 24, 9 <17, (14, 24, 9)>
- Central Node: 1, Leaves: 26, 29 <1, (26, 29)>
- Central Node: 0, Leaves: 2, 8, 23 <0, (2, 8, 23)>
- Central Node: 2, Leaves: 0, 19 <2, (0, 19)>
- Central Node: 5, Leaves: 3, 13, 27 <5, (3, 13, 27)>
- Central Node: 6, Leaves: 21, 16, 18 <6, (21, 16, 18)>
- Central Node: 15, Leaves: 14, 6, 25 <15, (14, 6, 25)>
- Central Node: 11, Leaves: 14, 23, 27 <11, (14, 23, 27)>
- Central Node: 24, Leaves: 17, 16, 9 <24, (17, 16, 9)>
- Central Node: 18, Leaves: 28, 13, 6, 10 <18, (28, 13, 6)>
- Central Node: 4, Leaves: 9, 19, 10 <4, (9, 19, 10)>
- Central Node: 9, Leaves: 17, 24, 4, 27 <9, (17, 24, 4)>
- Central Node: 19, Leaves: 14, 2, 23, 4 <19, (14, 2, 23)>
- Central Node: 27, Leaves: 5, 9, 11, 10, 28 <27, (5, 9, 11)>
- Central Node: 28, Leaves: 21, 18, 3, 7, 27 <28, (21, 18, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
