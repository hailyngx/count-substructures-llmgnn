Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
