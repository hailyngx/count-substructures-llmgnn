Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 18) (16, 19) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 15) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 18) (17, 0) (17, 9) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 14) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 15) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 12) (9, 15) (9, 17) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 19) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated based on the number of times each node appears as the central node in a 3-star structure.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0: Appears as a leaf in 2 edges
- Node 1: Appears as a leaf in 2 edges
- Node 2: Appears as a leaf in 3 edges
- Node 3: Appears as a leaf in 3 edges
- Node 4: Appears as a leaf in 4 edges
- Node 5: Appears as a leaf in 4 edges
- Node 6: Appears as a leaf in 3 edges
- Node 7: Appears as a leaf in 4 edges
- Node 8: Appears as a leaf in 3 edges
- Node 9: Appears as a leaf in 2 edges
- Node 10: Appears as a leaf in 3 edges
- Node 11: Appears as a leaf in 3 edges
- Node 12: Appears as a leaf in 4 edges
- Node 13: Appears as a leaf in 4 edges
- Node 14: Appears as a leaf in 4 edges
- Node 15: Appears as a leaf in 3 edges
- Node 16: Appears as a leaf in 2 edges
- Node 17: Appears as a leaf in 2 edges
- Node 18: Appears as a leaf in 3 edges
- Node 19: Appears as a leaf in 3 edges

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Number of 3-stars = (Number of edges incident on leaf nodes) / 2
- Total number of 3-stars = (2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3) / 2
- Total number of 3-stars = 60 / 2
- Total number of 3-stars = [30]

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (10, 8, 5)>
<12, (4, 14, 3)>
<13, (5, 19, 3)>
<14, (3, 12, 8)>
<3, (13, 12, 14)>
<4, (7, 6, 12)>
<5, (2, 13, 16)>
<15, (1, 18, 9)>
<18, (11, 15, 1)>
<19, (16, 6, 13)>
