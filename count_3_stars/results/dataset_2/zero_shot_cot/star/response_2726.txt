Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 14) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 10) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 5) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 7) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 13) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) 

Response:
There are 3-stars in the graph. Let's find them step-by-step.

1. Identify all the nodes that have degree 3 and check if they are connected to each other.

Nodes with degree 3: 5, 6, 10, 12

2. Check each node and its neighbors for the 3-star pattern.

- For node 5: (5, 8, 10), (5, 6, 12)
- For node 6: (6, 4, 13), (6, 5, 3)
- For node 10: (10, 8, 13), (10, 2, 14)
- For node 12: (12, 5, 14), (12, 3, 1)

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (8, 10, 6)>
<5, (6, 12, 5)>
<6, (4, 13, 6)>
<6, (5, 3, 6)>
<10, (8, 13, 10)>
<10, (2, 14, 10)>
<12, (5, 14, 12)>
<12, (3, 1, 12)>

So, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
