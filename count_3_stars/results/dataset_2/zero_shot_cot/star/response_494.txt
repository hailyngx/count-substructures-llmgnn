Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify all possible 3-stars:

1. <1, (9, 4, 7)>
2. <3, (9, 1, 6)>
3. <6, (9, 1, 2)>
4. <8, (9, 7, 1)>
5. <0, (5, 3, 2)>

Now let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph based on the identified configurations:
