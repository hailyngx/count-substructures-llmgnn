Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 11) (8, 18) (0, 5) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 18) (1, 15) (1, 17) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 7) (10, 15) (10, 2) (10, 16) (19, 8) (19, 7) (19, 16) (4, 9) (4, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 11) (7, 17) (7, 19) (7, 16) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 7) (16, 18) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly two edges. These nodes could potentially form a 3-star with the center node.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 15, and 18.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 10, and 12.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 12, and 18.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8, 10, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 11, 18, and 19.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 11, and 15.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 6, 8, 14, and 16.

Now, we look for 3-stars in the graph by examining the nodes that are connected to the center node and see if they are connected to each other. 

The 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (2, 15, 18)>
<15, (1, 10, 12)>
<6, (5, 2, 12)>
<2, (6, 10, 14)>
<8, (11, 18, 19)>
<12, (1, 6, 11)>
<18, (8, 14, 16)>

Therefore, there are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [7].
