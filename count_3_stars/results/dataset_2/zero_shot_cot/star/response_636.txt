Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 15) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 19) (7, 9) (15, 17) (15, 16) (13, 14) (13, 17) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 12) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 6) (6, 14) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 19) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (18, 8) 

Response:
The first step is to identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 10, 4, 6, 9
Node 1: 3, 12
Node 2: 11, 8, 5
Node 3: 1, 16, 4
Node 4: 0, 3, 5, 9
Node 5: 11, 2, 4
Node 6: 14, 0, 12, 19
Node 7: 19, 9
Node 8: 2, 16, 12, 18
Node 9: 11, 0, 7, 4
Node 10: 11, 0
Node 11: 10, 2, 9, 5, 19
Node 12: 1, 8, 16, 6
Node 13: 14, 17
Node 14: 6, 13
Node 15: 17, 16
Node 16: 3, 8, 15, 12
Node 17: 13, 15
Node 18: 8
Node 19: 11, 7, 6

Now, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (10, 4, 9)>
<1, (3, 12, 16)>
<2, (11, 8, 5)>
<3, (1, 16, 4)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (11, 2, 4)>
<6, (14, 12, 19)>
<7, (19, 9, 11)>
<8, (2, 16, 12)>
<9, (11, 0, 4)>
<10, (0, 11, 4)>
<11, (10, 2, 9)>
<12, (1, 8, 16)>
<13, (14, 17, 15)>
<14, (6, 13, 17)>
<15, (17, 16, 13)>
<16, (3, 8, 12)>
<17, (13, 15, 14)>
<18, (8)>
<19, (11, 7, 6)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
