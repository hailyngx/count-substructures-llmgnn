Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 3)
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 0)
- Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 0)
- Node 8: (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 1)
- Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 8), (2, 1)
- Node 0: (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 7), (0, 3)

2. Count the number of 3-stars:
- There are 7 nodes connected to exactly three other nodes, which means there are 7 possible 3-stars.

3. List the unique 3-stars:
<5, (9, 2, 3)>
<6, (9, 1, 4)>
<4, (9, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 2, 3)>
<2, (5, 4, 8)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 3)>

4. Count the total number of unique 3-stars:
