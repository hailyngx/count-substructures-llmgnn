Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
The total number of 3-star graphs can be calculated by counting the number of nodes that have exactly three adjacent edges. 

Let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them: nodes 0, 7, and 9.

From these, we can form the following 3-star graphs:
<0, (2, 6, 3)>
<7, (5, 9, 3)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this given graph is [3].
