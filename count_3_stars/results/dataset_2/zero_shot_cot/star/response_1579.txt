Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 12) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 4) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 4) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 14) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
