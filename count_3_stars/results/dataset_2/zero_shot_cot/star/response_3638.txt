Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (15, 8) (15, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 3) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
There are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Thus, the final answer is [5].

The unique 3-stars are:
<10, (0, 14, 17)>
<17, (4, 9, 10)>
<2, (0, 14, 12)>
<18, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (8, 10, 17)>
