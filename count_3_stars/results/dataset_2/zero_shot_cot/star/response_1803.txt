Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 0) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 3) (10, 13) (10, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 14) 

Response:
Let's analyze the connections each node has. We are looking for 3-stars where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Node 0: Edges with nodes 4, 6, 12, 11, 3; (4, 6, 12) forms a 3-star.
Node 1: Edges with nodes 9, 8, 11, 14; (8, 11, 14) forms a 3-star.
Node 2: Edges with nodes 9, 8, 12; (9, 8, 12) forms a 3-star.
Node 3: Edges with nodes 5, 9, 8, 14, 0; (5, 9, 8) forms a 3-star.
Node 4: Edges with nodes 0, 10, 6; (0, 10, 6) forms a 3-star.
Node 5: Edges with nodes 9, 13, 7, 3; (9, 13, 7) forms a 3-star.
Node 6: Edges with nodes 4, 12, 0; (4, 12, 0) forms a 3-star.
Node 7: Edges with nodes 5, 13, 14; (5, 13, 7) forms a 3-star.
Node 8: Edges with nodes 13, 2, 11, 1, 3; (13, 2, 1) forms a 3-star.
Node 9: Edges with nodes 5, 2, 1, 12, 3; (5, 2, 1) forms a 3-star.
Node 10: Edges with nodes 13, 4; No 3-star here.
Node 11: Edges with nodes 8, 1, 12, 0; (8, 1, 12) forms a 3-star.
Node 12: Edges with nodes 9, 2, 6, 0, 11; (9, 2, 6) forms a 3-star.
Node 13: Edges with nodes 5, 8, 10, 14, 7; (5, 8, 7) forms a 3-star.
Node 14: Edges with nodes 13, 1, 3, 7; (13, 1, 7) forms a 3-star.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<4, 6, 12>, <8, 11, 14>, <9, 8, 12>, <5, 9, 8>, <0, 10, 6>, <9, 13, 7>, <4, 12, 0>, <5, 13, 7>, <13, 2, 1>, <8, 1, 12>, <9, 2, 6>, <5, 8, 7>, <13, 1, 7>.
