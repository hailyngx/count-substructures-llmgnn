Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 18) (16, 10) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 2) (17, 11) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 0) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 15) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 16) (18, 2) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 4) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 13) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 0) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 19) (4, 0) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 4) (0, 12) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the central nodes of the 3-stars in the graph. We can do this by searching for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 
From the given edges, the central nodes are: 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19. 
Next, we need to find the leaves connected to each central node.
Let's list the 3-stars one by one:
<0, (4, 8, 19)>
<2, (5, 14, 18)>
<4, (1, 10, 19)>
<8, (0, 13, 15)>
<10, (9, 4, 16)>
<13, (11, 8, 15)>
<14, (17, 4, 2)>
<16, (15, 10, 18)>
<17, (7, 12, 14)>
<19, (0, 2, 4)>
Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [10] 3-stars.
