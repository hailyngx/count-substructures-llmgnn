Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (0, 4) (0, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 17) (5, 3) (5, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (10, 18) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 18, and 6.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 17, 13, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 19, and 12.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 11, 5, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 12, 18, and 14.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 16, 12, and 15.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 14.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 17.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 16, and 10.

2. Counting the unique 3-stars:
<4, (12, 18, 6)>
<16, (17, 13, 8)>
<7, (11, 19, 12)>
<3, (11, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 1)>
<9, (12, 18, 14)>
<17, (16, 12, 15)>
<2, (0, 1, 14)>
<15, (11, 14, 17)>
<8, (3, 16, 10)>

[There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph.]
