Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 20) (11, 25) (16, 11) (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 20) (1, 24) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 2) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 22) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 29) (10, 27) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 18) (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 27) (18, 29) (22, 7) (22, 26) (22, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (9, 17) (9, 22) (9, 15) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 14) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 5) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 23) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 23) (23, 21) (23, 29) (23, 0) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (24, 1) (24, 20) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 4) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (14, 18) (14, 28) (14, 5) (14, 15) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 12) (27, 10) (27, 18) (12, 3) (12, 25) (4, 11) (4, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes through edges.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 11: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 2) [One 3-star: <11, (16, 4, 2)>]
2. Node 16: No 3-star since it has only two edges.
3. Node 1: (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 20) [One 3-star: <1, (21, 25, 20)>]
4. Node 21: (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 2) [One 3-star: <21, (1, 23, 2)>]
5. Node 7: (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 22) [One 3-star: <7, (20, 6, 22)>]
6. Node 8: (8, 5) (8, 0) [No 3-star since it has only two edges.]
7. Node 13: No 3-star since it has only one edge.
8. Node 10: No 3-star since it has only one edge.
9. Node 17: (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 5) [One 3-star: <17, (6, 9, 5)>]
10. Node 2: (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) [One 3-star: <2, (11, 21, 18)>]
11. Node 18: (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 14) [One 3-star: <18, (17, 2, 14)>]
12. Node 22: (22, 7) (22, 26) (22, 9) [One 3-star: <22, (7, 26, 9)>]
13. Node 26: (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) [One 3-star: <26, (22, 28, 15)>]
14. Node 9: (9, 17) (9, 22) (9, 15) [One 3-star: <9, (17, 22, 15)>]
15. Node 28: (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 0) [One 3-star: <28, (26, 3, 0)>]
16. Node 5: (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 19) [One 3-star: <5, (8, 17, 19)>]
17. Node 19: (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 29) [One 3-star: <19, (2, 5, 29)>]
18. Node 29: (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 23) [One 3-star: <29, (13, 18, 23)>]
19. Node 0: (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 23) [One 3-star: <0, (8, 28, 23)>]
20. Node 3: (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 12) [One 3-star: <3, (28, 6, 12)>]
21. Node 6: (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) [One 3-star: <6, (7, 17, 3)>]
22. Node 24: No 3-star since it has only two edges.
23. Node 15: (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 14) [One 3-star: <15, (26, 9, 14)>]
24. Node 20: (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 7) [One 3-star: <20, (11, 1, 7)>]
25. Node 14: (14, 18) (14, 28) (14, 5) [One 3-star: <14, (18, 28, 5)>]
26. Node 25: (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 12) [One 3-star: <25, (11, 1, 12)>]
27. Node 27: (27, 10) (27, 18) [No 3-star since it has only two edges.]
28. Node 12: (12, 3) (12, 25) [No 3-star since it has only two edges.]
29. Node 4: (4, 11) (4, 15) [No 3-star since it has only two edges.]

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [20]
