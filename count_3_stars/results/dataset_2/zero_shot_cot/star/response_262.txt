Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 16) (22, 21) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 14) (7, 2) (21, 22) (21, 7) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 25) (27, 28) (27, 3) (27, 1) (15, 23) (15, 29) (20, 19) (20, 6) (19, 13) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 28) (26, 19) (26, 3) (26, 4) (6, 20) (6, 25) (6, 16) (8, 9) (8, 5) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 14) (11, 19) (11, 23) (23, 15) (23, 11) (23, 25) (23, 16) (23, 0) (29, 15) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 3) (25, 27) (25, 6) (25, 9) (25, 23) (17, 13) (17, 24) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 2) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 24) (3, 27) (3, 26) (3, 29) (3, 0) (5, 8) (5, 28) (5, 16) (24, 7) (24, 17) (24, 0) (1, 27) (1, 10) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 16) (4, 26) (4, 29) (4, 10) (16, 22) (16, 6) (16, 23) (16, 5) (16, 14) (28, 27) (28, 19) (28, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: {23, 24, 3}
- Node 1: {10, 27}
- Node 2: {7, 10}
- Node 3: {0, 26, 27, 29}
- Node 4: {10, 26, 29}
- Node 5: {8, 16, 28}
- Node 6: {16, 20, 25}
- Node 7: {2, 14, 21, 24}
- Node 8: {5, 9}
- Node 9: {8, 14, 25, 29}
- Node 10: {1, 2, 4}
- Node 11: {19, 23}
- Node 12: {27}
- Node 13: {17, 19, 22}
- Node 14: {7, 9, 16}
- Node 15: {23, 29}
- Node 16: {5, 6, 14, 22, 23}
- Node 17: {13, 24}
- Node 19: {11, 13, 20, 26, 28}
- Node 20: {6, 19}
- Node 21: {7, 22}
- Node 22: {13, 16, 21}
- Node 23: {0, 11, 15, 16, 25, 29}
- Node 24: {0, 7, 17}
- Node 25: {6, 9, 23, 27}
- Node 26: {3, 4, 19}
- Node 27: {1, 12, 25, 28, 3}
- Node 28: {19, 27, 5}
- Node 29: {3, 4, 9, 15}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- <13, (22, 19, 17)>
- <22, (13, 16, 21)>
- <7, (21, 14, 24)>
- <21, (22, 7, 16)>
- <12, (27, 25, 28)>
- <27, (12, 25, 3)>
- <15, (23, 29, 0)>
- <20, (19, 6, 26)>
- <6, (20, 16, 25)>
- <8, (9, 5, 14)>
- <9, (8, 25, 29)>
- <11, (19, 23, 15)>
- <17, (13, 24, 0)>
- <10, (1, 4, 2)>
