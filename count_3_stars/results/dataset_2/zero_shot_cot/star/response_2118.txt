Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 3) 

Response:
There are a total of 6 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

Here are the 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (4, 13, 2)>
<1, (4, 11, 6)>
<2, (9, 13, 3)>
<5, (9, 7, 6)>
<8, (4, 12, 1)>
<10, (9, 14, 3)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
