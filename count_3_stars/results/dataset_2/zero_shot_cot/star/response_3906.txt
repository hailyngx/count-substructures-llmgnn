Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 27) (9, 19) (26, 9) (26, 29) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 7) (23, 20) (12, 20) (12, 17) (12, 1) (27, 9) (27, 13) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 7) (20, 22) (20, 23) (20, 12) (20, 0) (20, 19) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 28) (21, 28) (21, 10) (21, 18) (28, 8) (28, 21) (28, 3) (28, 18) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 11) (29, 26) (29, 1) (29, 6) (29, 24) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 5) (11, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (7, 22) (7, 0) (7, 16) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 14) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 8) (19, 13) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 24) (16, 7) (16, 4) (16, 6) (10, 21) (10, 13) (6, 29) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 16) (13, 27) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 10) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 24) (24, 29) (24, 5) (24, 4) (14, 15) (18, 21) (18, 28) (18, 17) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the central nodes in the 3-stars. The central nodes will have exactly three edges. 

The central nodes are: 9, 26, 22, 20, 8, 21, 28, 17, 29, 15, 5, 16, 13, 4

Next, we need to identify the leaf nodes connected to each central node.

<9, (26, 0, 11)>
<26, (9, 29, 1)>
<22, (0, 20, 7)>
<20, (22, 23, 12)>
<8, (2, 19, 28)>
<21, (28, 10, 18)>
<28, (8, 21, 3)>
<17, (12, 18, 11)>
<29, (26, 1, 6)>
<15, (1, 6, 13)>
<5, (3, 11, 4)>
<16, (7, 4, 6)>
<13, (27, 15, 19)>
<4, (5, 16, 24)>

Now, we have identified all the unique 3-stars in the given graph. By counting these unique 3-stars, we can determine the total number of 3-stars.
The total number of 3-stars is [14].
