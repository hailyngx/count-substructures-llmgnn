Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 3) (26, 9) (26, 2) (26, 11) (11, 26) (11, 16) (11, 27) (16, 11) (16, 28) (16, 17) (16, 18) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 10) (21, 20) (21, 22) (18, 16) (18, 22) (18, 12) (18, 3) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 27) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 24) (10, 21) (10, 17) (10, 8) (17, 16) (17, 10) (17, 19) (13, 12) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (28, 16) (28, 6) (28, 8) (20, 21) (20, 1) (29, 4) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 25) (1, 6) (1, 20) (1, 25) (8, 10) (8, 28) (8, 14) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 23) (5, 25) (23, 5) (23, 27) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 25) (24, 3) (24, 15) (24, 0) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (2, 26) (2, 4) (25, 12) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 19) (27, 11) (27, 22) (27, 6) (27, 23) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

<9, (26, 14, 3)>
<26, (11, 2, 9)>
<11, (16, 27, 26)>
<16, (18, 28, 11)>
<4, (2, 29, 6)>
<7, (21, 19, 14)>
<21, (22, 10, 7)>
<18, (3, 22, 16)>
<22, (27, 18, 21)>
<3, (15, 0, 9)>
<15, (24, 3, 25)>
<10, (8, 17, 21)>
<17, (19, 10, 16)>
<13, (25, 12, 6)>
<6, (1, 28, 27)>
<28, (8, 16, 6)>
<20, (1, 21, 25)>
<29, (2, 4, 6)>
<12, (25, 13, 18)>
<1, (6, 20, 25)>
<8, (14, 28, 10)>
<0, (5, 24, 3)>
<5, (23, 0, 25)>
<23, (27, 5, 23)>
<19, (25, 17, 7)>
<24, (0, 15, 3)>
<14, (8, 7, 9)>
<2, (4, 26, 29)>
<25, (19, 1, 12)>
<27, (23, 6, 11)>

There are 30 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
