Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 19) (6, 4) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 19) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 12) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 13) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 4) (7, 5) (7, 10) (16, 17) (16, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 16) (3, 19) (18, 1) (18, 8) (18, 15) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 15) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 1) (12, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern in the graph.

Let's go through the given edges and identify the 3-stars:
1. Identify nodes with degree 3: Nodes 5 and 10 have degree 3 and can be central nodes of 3-stars.
2. For each central node:
    - Node 5: (5, 9) (5, 7) (7, 5) form a 3-star <5, (9, 7)>
    - Node 10: (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 13) form a 3-star <10, (3, 7, 13)>

In total, there are 2 unique 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
Unique 3-stars: <<5, (9, 7)>, <10, (3, 7, 13)>>
