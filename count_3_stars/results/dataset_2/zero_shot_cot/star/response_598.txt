Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify all 3-stars in the graph:
1. <5, (9, 6, 2)>
2. <4, (5, 7, 1)>
3. <7, (9, 4, 6)>
4. <1, (5, 4, 0)>
5. <3, (9, 4, 0)>
6. <6, (5, 4, 7)>
7. <2, (5, 0, 8)>
8. <8, (5, 7, 2)>
9. <0, (9, 1, 3)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
[9]
