Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's identify all the 3-stars based on the definition provided.
Since a 3-star includes a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we need to find all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

1. Node 4 is connected to 5, 7, and 8. Therefore, a 3-star is formed with central node 4 and leaves 5, 7, 8. <4, (5, 7, 8)>

2. Node 6 is connected to 0, 1, and 9. Therefore, a 3-star is formed with central node 6 and leaves 0, 1, 9. <6, (0, 1, 9)>

3. Node 1 is connected to 3, 5, and 6. Therefore, a 3-star is formed with central node 1 and leaves 3, 5, 6. <1, (3, 5, 6)>

4. Node 8 is connected to 1, 4, and 5. Therefore, a 3-star is formed with central node 8 and leaves 1, 4, 5. <8, (1, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4]. 
<4, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>
