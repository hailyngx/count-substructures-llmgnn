Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for all unique 3-stars with one central node and three leaves. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (9, 7, 8)>
<2, (10, 3, 1)>
<3, (2, 10, 4)>
<4, (5, 13, 2)>
<5, (6, 12, 7)>
<6, (7, 6, 12)>
<7, (8, 12, 14)>
<8, (9, 1, 11)>
<9, (10, 2, 1)>
<10, (11, 14, 9)>
<11, (12, 6, 5)>
<12, (13, 4, 5)>
<13, (14, 10, 8)>
<14, (1, 9, 7)>
<15, (2, 3, 4)>

There are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
