Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 16) (2, 11) (2, 15) (2, 4) (18, 6) (18, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 18) (14, 0) (14, 16) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 17) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 19) (11, 15) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 10) (1, 12) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 4) (5, 18) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 3) (17, 19) (19, 11) (19, 17) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 10) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars:

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph as potential central nodes for 3-stars.
2. For each potential central node, count the number of distinct 3-star configurations.

Let's start by listing the potential central nodes (nodes connected to exactly three other nodes):
- Nodes with degree 3: 10

Now, let's list the distinct 3-stars found:

<6, (9, 10, 18)>
<9, (6, 17, 13)>
<13, (8, 9, 16)>
<2, (11, 15, 4)>
<18, (6, 14, 5)>
<0, (8, 14, 15)>
<14, (18, 0, 16)>
<3, (9, 8, 17)>
<11, (2, 19, 15)>
<1, (7, 10, 12)>
<15, (2, 0, 11)>
<4, (6, 2, 3)>
<17, (9, 18, 3)>
<16, (13, 14, 10)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
