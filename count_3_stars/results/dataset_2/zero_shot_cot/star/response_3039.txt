Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 16) (13, 10) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 29) (12, 27) (12, 17) (27, 13) (27, 12) (27, 18) (6, 28) (6, 10) (6, 23) (28, 6) (28, 17) (4, 3) (18, 27) (18, 11) (18, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 24) (14, 0) (14, 23) (14, 15) (14, 16) (5, 23) (5, 1) (5, 21) (5, 16) (26, 15) (26, 7) (7, 26) (7, 15) (7, 24) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 15) (8, 20) (9, 16) (11, 18) (11, 23) (11, 17) (11, 2) (23, 6) (23, 14) (23, 5) (23, 11) (23, 21) (10, 13) (10, 22) (10, 6) (10, 0) (21, 5) (21, 23) (21, 24) (20, 8) (20, 3) (20, 19) (29, 22) (29, 25) (29, 3) (17, 12) (17, 28) (17, 18) (17, 11) (1, 5) (1, 25) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 29) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 25) (2, 11) (2, 19) (19, 20) (19, 2) (24, 0) (24, 7) (24, 21) (16, 13) (16, 14) (16, 5) (16, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars step by step:
1. Node 13 is connected to nodes 22, 16, and 10. <13, (22, 16, 10)>
2. Node 22 is connected to nodes 13, 10, and 29. <22, (13, 10, 29)>
3. Node 27 is connected to nodes 12, 18, and 13. <27, (12, 18, 13)>
4. Node 6 is connected to nodes 28, 10, and 23. <6, (28, 10, 23)>
5. Node 14 is connected to nodes 0, 23, and 15. <14, (0, 23, 15)>
6. Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 21, and 16. <5, (1, 21, 16)>
7. Node 7 is connected to nodes 26, 24, and 15. <7, (26, 24, 15)>
8. Node 25 is connected to nodes 1, 15, and 29. <25, (1, 15, 29)>
9. Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 20, and 29. <3, (4, 20, 29)>
10. Node 11 is connected to nodes 18, 23, and 17. <11, (18, 23, 17)>
11. Node 16 is connected to nodes 13, 14, and 5. <16, (13, 14, 5)>
12. Node 18 is connected to nodes 27, 11, and 17. <18, (27, 11, 17)>
13. Node 0 is connected to nodes 14, 15, and 10. <0, (14, 15, 10)>
14. Node 21 is connected to nodes 5, 23, and 24. <21, (5, 23, 24)>
15. Node 15 is connected to nodes 0, 25, and 7. <15, (0, 25, 7)>
16. Node 19 is connected to nodes 20, 2, and 26. <19, (20, 2, 26)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph. 
There are 16 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [16].
