Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 28) (7, 27) (7, 1) (18, 22) (18, 14) (18, 6) (18, 29) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 29) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 20) (17, 15) (0, 10) (0, 20) (0, 15) (20, 11) (20, 0) (20, 27) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 27) (8, 28) (8, 21) (8, 3) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 13) (14, 18) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 5) (13, 11) (13, 29) (26, 2) (26, 28) (26, 3) (5, 14) (5, 21) (28, 7) (28, 8) (28, 26) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 24) (12, 1) (6, 18) (6, 14) (6, 24) (6, 25) (24, 12) (24, 6) (24, 25) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 16) (3, 8) (3, 26) (19, 2) (19, 25) (19, 16) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 0) (16, 22) (16, 1) (16, 19) (23, 4) (25, 6) (25, 24) (25, 19) (9, 10) (9, 11) (27, 7) (27, 20) (27, 2) (21, 8) (21, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:
<4, (7, 12, 23)>
<7, (4, 15, 28)>
<18, (22, 14, 6)>
<22, (18, 16, 29)>
<10, (0, 9, 20)>
<11, (9, 13, 12)>
<0, (10, 20, 15)>
<20, (11, 0, 27)>
<2, (26, 19, 27)>
<8, (28, 21, 3)>
<29, (18, 22, 13)>
<14, (18, 6, 12)>
<13, (11, 29, 13)>
<26, (2, 28, 3)>
<5, (14, 21, 6)>
<3, (8, 26, 9)>
<6, (18, 14, 24)>
<24, (12, 6, 25)>
<1, (7, 12, 16)>
<19, (2, 25, 16)>
<15, (4, 7, 17)>
<16, (22, 1, 19)>
<25, (6, 24, 19)>
<9, (10, 11, 3)>
<27, (7, 20, 2)>
<21, (8, 5, 28)>

To find the total number of 3-stars, we count the number of unique 3-stars:
