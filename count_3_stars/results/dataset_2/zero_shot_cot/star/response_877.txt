Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the central nodes and their connected leaves. Let's list the unique 3-stars found and then count the total.

<1, (5, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 1)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 2)>
<5, (9, 4, 8)>
<6, (5, 3, 0)>
<7, (1, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 8, 5)>
<9, (5, 9, 1)>
<0, (2, 0, 3)>

There are 10 unique 3-stars in this graph. So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
