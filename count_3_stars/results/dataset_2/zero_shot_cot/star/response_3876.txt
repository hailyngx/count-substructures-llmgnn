Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 15) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (18, 2) (18, 1) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 18) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 13) (15, 19) (4, 0) (4, 19) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 7) (19, 15) (19, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the possible 3-stars with the given edges. 

Let's start by listing out all the 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (6, 13, 17)>
<2, (3, 7, 12)>
<3, (2, 11, 13)>
<4, (0, 7, 19)>
<5, (0, 11, 19)>
<6, (1, 9, 10)>
<7, (0, 2, 17)>
<8, (0, 13, 15)>
<9, (1, 6, 12)>
<10, (6, 10, 12)>
<11, (3, 5, 9)>
<12, (2, 9, 10)>
<13, (1, 3, 15)>
<14, (17, 19, 3)>
<15, (13, 15, 17)>
<16, (18, 2, 1)>
<17, (1, 15, 14)>
<18, (16, ???)>
<19, (14, 4, 7)>

Since we cannot determine the third node for the 3-star with the central node 18, we cannot count it. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
