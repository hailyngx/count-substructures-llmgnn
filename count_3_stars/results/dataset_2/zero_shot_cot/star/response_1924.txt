This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 9) (10, 7) (10, 23) (10, 14) (10, 29) (11, 13) (12, 15) (12, 25) (12, 0) (12, 9) (2, 26) (2, 16) (6, 17) (6, 7) (28, 8) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 2) (26, 3) (26, 0) (23, 27) (23, 10) (23, 19) (16, 2) (21, 20) (21, 4) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (25, 13) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 4) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 20) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 17) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 28) (1, 29) (1, 5) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 1) (29, 8) (24, 15) (24, 20) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 29) (0, 12) (0, 26) (0, 17) (7, 10) (7, 6) (7, 14) (20, 21) (20, 14) (20, 24) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 25) (4, 5) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (3, 26) (3, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the given graph:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 12, 26, 17
- Node 1 has neighbors: 29, 5
- Node 2 has neighbors: 26, 16
- Node 3 has neighbors: 26, 5
- Node 4 has neighbors: 13, 21, 25, 5
- Node 6 has neighbors: 17, 7
- Node 8 has neighbors: 15, 28, 14, 29
- Node 9 has neighbors: 18, 12, 28
- Node 10 has neighbors: 7, 23, 14, 29
- Node 11 has neighbors: 13
- Node 12 has neighbors: 15, 25, 0, 9
- Node 13 has neighbors: 22, 25, 4, 11
- Node 14 has neighbors: 10, 8, 7, 20
- Node 15 has neighbors: 27, 8, 12, 24
- Node 16 has neighbors: 2
- Node 17 has neighbors: 6, 19, 5
- Node 18 has neighbors: 22, 9
- Node 19 has neighbors: 28, 23, 17
- Node 20 has neighbors: 21, 14, 24
- Node 21 has neighbors: 20, 4
- Node 22 has neighbors: 13, 18
- Node 23 has neighbors: 27, 10, 19
- Node 24 has neighbors: 15, 20
- Node 25 has neighbors: 13, 12, 5, 4
- Node 26 has neighbors: 2, 3, 0
- Node 27 has neighbors: 15, 29, 23
- Node 28 has neighbors: 8, 9, 19
- Node 29 has neighbors: 27, 10, 1, 8

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- The total number of 3-stars (3-star graph configurations) can be calculated by simply counting the number of nodes with exactly 3 neighbors. From the given graph, we can see that there are [19] such nodes.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (5, 29, 1)>
<2, (16, 26, 2)>
<3, (5, 26, 3)>
<6, (7, 17, 6)>
<11, (13, 11, 0)>
<21, (4, 21, 20)>
<25, (13, 25, 4)>
<28, (8, 28, 19)>
<0, (12, 0, 26)>
<7, (14, 7, 10)>
<10, (29, 10, 7)>
<15, (15, 27, 23)>
<20, (14, 20, 24)>
<12, (15, 12, 9)>
<14, (14, 8, 29)>
<19, (17, 19, 28)>
<9, (9, 18, 28)>
<4, (25, 4, 5)>
<17, (5, 17, 1)>
<23, (23, 27, 19)> 

Therefore, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
