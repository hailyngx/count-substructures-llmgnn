Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 24) (15, 3) (15, 5) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 22) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 16) (1, 27) (1, 26) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 29) (26, 11) (26, 4) (4, 26) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 17) (18, 4) (18, 8) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 25) (8, 18) (8, 2) (8, 28) (19, 0) (19, 26) (19, 23) (19, 9) (17, 27) (17, 4) (17, 13) (17, 9) (11, 0) (11, 26) (11, 23) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 29) (23, 19) (23, 11) (16, 0) (16, 27) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 5) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 6) (6, 12) (6, 29) (24, 3) (24, 25) (9, 19) (9, 17) (9, 20) (29, 26) (29, 13) (29, 6) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 10) (7, 1) (7, 14) (21, 13) (21, 5) (20, 9) (14, 16) (14, 7) (14, 25) (22, 0) (22, 27) (22, 10) (25, 2) (25, 24) (25, 14) (5, 15) (5, 16) (5, 21) (10, 2) (10, 28) (10, 22) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated by identifying 3-node sets where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's find the unique 3-stars.

The degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 3
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4
- Node 10: degree 3
- Node 11: degree 3
- Node 12: degree 3
- Node 13: degree 3
- Node 14: degree 3
- Node 15: degree 2
- Node 16: degree 5
- Node 17: degree 4
- Node 18: degree 3
- Node 19: degree 4
- Node 20: degree 2
- Node 21: degree 2
- Node 22: degree 3
- Node 23: degree 2
- Node 24: degree 2
- Node 25: degree 3
- Node 26: degree 5
- Node 27: degree 4
- Node 28: degree 3
- Node 29: degree 4

Based on the degrees, the 3-stars are as follows:
<0, (11, 22, 19)>
<1, (26, 27, 7)>
<2, (8, 10, 25)>
<4, (18, 12, 17)>
<5, (16, 21, 15)>
<9, (20, 29, 17)>
<13, (21, 29, 17)>
<14, (16, 25, 7)>
<26, (1, 19, 29)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [9].
