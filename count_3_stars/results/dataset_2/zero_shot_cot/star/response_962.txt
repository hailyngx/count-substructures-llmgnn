Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the graph can be calculated by looking at all possible combinations where a node is at the center and it is connected to exactly 3 other nodes. 

We will identify and count the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 0: 
    - <0, (9, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (9, 7, 6)>
    - <0, (9, 7, 3)>
    - <0, (9, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (9, 6, 2)>
    - <0, (9, 6, 1)>
    - <0, (9, 8, 4)>
    - <0, (9, 8, 2)>
    - <0, (9, 8, 0)>
    - <0, (4, 8, 2)>
    - <0, (4, 8, 1)>
    - <0, (7, 6, 1)>
    - Total = 12

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 1:
    - <1, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 2)>
    - <1, (5, 6, 0)>
    - <1, (5, 9, 6)>
    - <1, (5, 9, 1)>
    - <1, (5, 1, 7)>
    - <1, (4, 8, 2)>
    - <1, (7, 6, 0)>
    - Total = 8

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 2:
    - <2, (6, 8, 0)>
    - <2, (6, 8, 1)>
    - <2, (6, 1, 0)>
    - <2, (3, 7, 0)>
    - Total = 4

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 3:
    - <3, (7, 0, 2)>
    - Total = 1

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 4:
    - <4, (8, 9, 1)>
    - Total = 1

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 5:
    - <5, (9, 6, 1)>
    - Total = 1

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 6:
    - <6, (5, 7, 1)>
    - Total = 1

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 7:
    - <7, (0, 6, 1)>
    - Total = 1

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 8:
    - <8, (9, 4, 2)>
    - Total = 1

- Possible 3-stars centered at node 9:
    - <9, (5, 6, 0)>
    - Total = 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [31].
