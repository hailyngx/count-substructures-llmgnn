Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
Let's start by finding the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes to identify the potential centers of 3-stars.
- Node 5 is connected to 4, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to 1, 3, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to 0, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to 1, 4, and 7.
- Node 8 is connected to 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to 1, 6, and 9.

Thus, we have found the following unique 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
