Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 16) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (14, 9) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 14) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 15) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 18) (10, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 10) (18, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 19) (11, 5) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 16) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 16) (16, 6) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 12) (16, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will need to identify all possible 3-stars.
Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (9, 14, 19)>
<1, (13, 15, 7)>
<2, (8, 10, 19)>
<3, (9, 13, 16)>
<4, (5, 12, 18)>
<5, (7, 11, 16)>
<6, (17, 5, 16)>
<8, (9, 14, 2)>
<9, (0, 14, 3)>
<10, (2, 12, 18)>
<12, (4, 10, 16)>
<13, (1, 3, 15)>
<14, (9, 17, 19)>
<15, (1, 13, 16)>
<16, (0, 3, 15)>
<17, (6, 14, 5)>
<18, (4, 10, 12)>
<19, (0, 2, 14)>

There are [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
