Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 6) (0, 27) (0, 1) (0, 19) (27, 0) (20, 25) (20, 21) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 2) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 24) (22, 18) (22, 26) (22, 10) (22, 3) (2, 4) (2, 25) (2, 18) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 16) (29, 28) (29, 14) (29, 10) (26, 22) (11, 28) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 6) (16, 28) (16, 5) (16, 19) (8, 25) (8, 19) (9, 3) (9, 12) (10, 22) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 6) (15, 10) (15, 23) (15, 21) (3, 22) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 21) (21, 20) (21, 15) (21, 3) (19, 0) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 1) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 19) (23, 4) (23, 15) (23, 24) (6, 7) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 14) (17, 5) (12, 25) (12, 11) (12, 9) (24, 18) (24, 23) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes will be the potential centers of the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges connected to them: 4, 7, 0, 27, 20, 18, 22, 25, 2, 28, 29, 26, 11, 13, 16, 8, 9, 10, 15, 3, 21, 19, 14, 1, 23, 6

Now, for each of these potential centers, we will check if they form a 3-star. A 3-star will consist of the center and three nodes that are connected only to the center. We will go through each potential center and identify the 3-stars.

Count of 3-stars: [5]
Unique 3-stars: <4, (7, 2, 23)>, <25, (7, 8, 12)>, <18, (2, 24, 22)>, <22, (18, 10, 26)>, <6, (7, 14, 18)>
