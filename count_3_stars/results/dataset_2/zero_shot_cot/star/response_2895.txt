Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 4) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 12) (2, 19) (2, 9) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 29) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 10) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 21) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 14) (21, 20) (21, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (29, 18) (29, 8) (25, 0) (25, 1) (27, 26) (27, 5) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 15) (26, 16) (11, 0) (11, 1) (24, 10) (24, 20) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 19) (17, 4) (17, 22) (17, 3) (1, 25) (1, 11) (15, 4) (15, 22) (15, 18) (15, 26) (16, 26) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 13) (20, 21) (20, 24) (20, 3) (12, 23) (12, 28) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (8, 22) (8, 29) (8, 10) (10, 28) (10, 24) (10, 8) (5, 18) (5, 14) (5, 21) (5, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Looking at the edges, we can see that the only configuration that forms a 3-star is:
- Node 22 connected to nodes 23, 6, and 15. <22, (23, 6, 15)>

Now, count the number of times this 3-star appears in the graph.

The 3-star <22, (23, 6, 15)> appears 1 time. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
