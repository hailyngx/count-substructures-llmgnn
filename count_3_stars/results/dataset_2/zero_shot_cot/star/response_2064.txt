Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 24) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 20) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 21) (28, 29) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 12) (6, 28) (6, 7) (6, 26) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 21) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 7) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 14) (22, 16) (22, 15) (17, 19) (17, 27) (20, 3) (20, 26) (5, 19) (5, 7) (5, 27) (19, 2) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 16) (8, 9) (8, 0) (23, 11) (10, 21) (10, 13) (10, 24) (21, 18) (21, 11) (21, 10) (21, 0) (4, 22) (12, 29) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 15) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 7) (16, 22) (16, 19) (16, 26) (16, 24) (16, 25) (24, 1) (24, 10) (24, 16) (25, 9) (25, 16) (14, 3) (14, 22) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 26) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 21) (0, 15) (15, 22) (15, 13) (15, 0) (27, 17) (27, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to only one other node, as these nodes can potentially be centers of 3-stars.
The nodes with degree 1 are: 4, 10, 12, 17, 18, 20, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29.

Now, let's check each of these potential center nodes and see if they can form a 3-star.
1. Node 4 is connected to node 22.
2. Node 10 is connected to nodes 21, 13, 24.
3. Node 12 is connected to node 29.
4. Node 17 is connected to nodes 19, 27.
5. Node 18 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 21.
6. Node 20 is connected to nodes 3, 26.
7. Node 23 is connected to node 11.
8. Node 24 is connected to nodes 1, 10, 16.
9. Node 25 is connected to node 9, 16.
10. Node 27 is connected to nodes 17, 5.
11. Node 28 is connected to nodes 29, 6, 11, 13.
12. Node 29 is connected to nodes 28, 12.

From above analysis, the unique 3-stars are:
<4, (22)>  
<12, (29)>  
<17, (19, 27)>  
<25, (9, 16)>  

There are [4] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
