Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 10)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (7, 9, 12)>
- <4, (0, 10, 11)>
- <5, (2, 10, 13)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (3, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 7, 12)>
- <9, (3, 7, 13)>
- <10, (0, 4, 13)>
- <11, (1, 4, 12)>
- <12, (3, 8, 11)>
- <13, (5, 9, 10)>
- <14, (4)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [15].
