Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will then check if these connections form a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph along with their central node and leaf nodes:

<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
