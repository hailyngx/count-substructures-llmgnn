Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 16) (3, 13) (3, 2) (0, 10) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 11) (7, 16) (7, 6) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 5) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 9) (8, 5) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (16, 3) (16, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 9) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (12, 11) (12, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will serve as potential centers for 3-stars. 

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1: connected to 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: connected to 1, 2, 13
- Node 5: connected to 0, 8, 15
- Node 8: connected to 5, 10, 19
- Node 11: connected to 1, 8, 12
- Node 13: connected to 1, 3, 4
- Node 16: connected to 3, 6, 7
- Node 17: connected to 0, 4, 19
- Node 19: connected to 5, 8, 17

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- <1, (5, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 3, 13)>
- <3, (1, 2, 13)>
- <5, (0, 8, 15)>
- <5, (8, 19, 17)>
- <8, (5, 10, 19)>
- <11, (1, 8, 12)>
- <13, (1, 3, 4)>
- <16, (3, 6, 7)>
- <17, (0, 4, 19)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10].
