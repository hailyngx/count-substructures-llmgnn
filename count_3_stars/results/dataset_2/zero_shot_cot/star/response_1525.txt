Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 5) (7, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (12, 7) (12, 8) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present.

First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to exactly 3 nodes:
- Node 0: Connected to 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11
- Node 1: Connected to 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 3: Connected to 6, 11, 13, 14
- Node 4: Connected to 0, 1, 2, 7, 10
- Node 5: Connected to 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: Connected to 0, 1, 3, 5, 13, 14
- Node 7: Connected to 4, 5, 7, 12, 13
- Node 10: Connected to 4, 9, 10, 14
- Node 11: Connected to 0, 3, 11, 13, 14
- Node 13: Connected to 3, 6, 7, 11, 13, 14
- Node 14: Connected to 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13

Next, we will list all the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<3, (6, 11, 13)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (4, 5, 12)>
<10, (4, 9, 14)>
<11, (0, 3, 13)>
<13, (3, 7, 14)>
<14, (3, 9, 10)>

Now, we count the total number of unique 3-stars, which is [10].
