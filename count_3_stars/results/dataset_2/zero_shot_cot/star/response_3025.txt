Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 1 to find possible 3-stars centered at node 1:

Nodes connected to node 1: (2, 3, 5, 6)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center:

There is one 3-star centered at node 1: <1, (5, 6, 0)>

Next, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 3 to find possible 3-stars centered at node 3:

Nodes connected to node 3: (1, 4, 8, 9, 11, 12)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center:

There are three 3-stars centered at node 3: <3, (1, 6, 11)>, <3, (4, 9, 12)>, <3, (8, 8, 7)>

Finally, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (centered at node 1) + 3 (centered at node 3) = 4

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
