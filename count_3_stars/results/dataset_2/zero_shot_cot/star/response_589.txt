Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 27) (22, 17) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 20) (17, 22) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 8) (18, 22) (18, 10) (18, 25) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 19) (3, 8) (25, 18) (25, 3) (25, 29) (25, 10) (4, 13) (4, 9) (4, 26) (8, 17) (8, 3) (8, 6) (15, 20) (15, 5) (15, 16) (20, 14) (20, 15) (20, 21) (20, 28) (20, 10) (2, 21) (21, 20) (21, 2) (21, 28) (21, 11) (28, 3) (28, 20) (28, 21) (26, 4) (0, 17) (0, 19) (7, 14) (7, 27) (6, 8) (6, 23) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 29) (12, 1) (12, 9) (29, 25) (29, 16) (29, 27) (29, 23) (5, 15) (23, 6) (23, 29) (23, 9) (11, 13) (11, 21) (11, 19) (11, 1) (19, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (27, 22) (27, 7) (27, 29) (27, 9) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 23) (9, 27) (10, 18) (10, 25) (10, 20) (10, 1) 

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes with exactly three neighbors. Let's go step by step:

- Node 22 has 4 neighbors: 13, 18, 27, 17.
- Node 14 has 3 neighbors: 17, 7, 20. 
We have found one 3-star: <14, (17, 7, 20)>.

Continue checking:

- Node 17 has 4 neighbors: 22, 14, 0, 8.
- Node 18 has 3 neighbors: 22, 10, 25.
We have found one more 3-star: <18, (22, 10, 25)>.

Go on:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 25, 28, 19, 8.
- Node 25 has 4 neighbors: 18, 3, 29, 10.
We have found another 3-star: <25, (18, 3, 29)>.

Checking further:

- Node 20 has 5 neighbors: 14, 15, 21, 28, 10.
We have found one more 3-star: <20, (14, 15, 21)>.

Keep looking:

- Node 21 has 4 neighbors: 20, 2, 28, 11.
- Node 27 has 4 neighbors: 22, 7, 29, 9.
We have found another 3-star: <27, (22, 7, 29)>.

Proceed:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 16, 12, 11, 10.
- Node 29 has 4 neighbors: 25, 16, 27, 23.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 4, 12, 23, 27.
We have found three more 3-stars: <1, (16, 12, 11)>, <29, (25, 16, 23)>, <9, (4, 12, 23)>.

Finally:

- Node 10 has 4 neighbors: 18, 25, 20, 1.
We have found one final 3-star: <10, (18, 25, 20)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
