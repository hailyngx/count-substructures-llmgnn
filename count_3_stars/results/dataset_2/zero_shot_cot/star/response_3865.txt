Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 4) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 4) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 12) (16, 4) (14, 8) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 7) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 18) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form each 3-star in the graph:

1. From node 9: (9, 15, 10), (9, 15, 17)
2. From node 13: (13, 8, 19), (13, 19, 10)
3. From node 10: (10, 9, 15), (10, 9, 19), (10, 11, 5), (10, 11, 0)
4. From node 11: (11, 10, 15), (11, 10, 19), (11, 0, 1), (11, 0, 4)
5. From node 3: (3, 8, 13), (3, 12, 17)
6. From node 17: (17, 15, 9), (17, 12, 18)
7. From node 19: (19, 6, 13), (19, 4, 16), (19, 10, 5), (19, 10, 9)
8. From node 0: (0, 11, 5), (0, 11, 10), (0, 1, 15)
9. From node 12: (12, 3, 8), (12, 17, 15), (12, 16, 4), (12, 18, 7)
10. From node 16: (16, 12, 4)
11. From node 4: (4, 17, 15), (4, 0, 11), (4, 16, 12)
12. From node 18: (18, 17, 7)

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars:
<9, (15, 10, 17)>, <13, (8, 19, 10)>, <10, (9, 15, 17)>, <11, (0, 1, 15)>, <3, (8, 13, 19)>, <17, (12, 18, 7)>, <19, (6, 13, 10)>, <0, (11, 5, 10)>, <12, (3, 8, 12)>, <16, (4, 12, 16)>, <4, (17, 15, 4)> [11]
