Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 24) (1, 27) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 11) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 25) (17, 8) (17, 22) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 19) (27, 1) (27, 12) (27, 10) (4, 24) (4, 25) (4, 15) (7, 23) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 20) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 28) (12, 21) (12, 14) (12, 27) (10, 27) (10, 15) (10, 23) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 9) (15, 10) (16, 0) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 23) (18, 5) (18, 3) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 20) (25, 17) (25, 4) (25, 16) (25, 26) (25, 2) (23, 7) (23, 10) (23, 16) (23, 5) (26, 25) (26, 20) (26, 29) (8, 1) (8, 17) (28, 9) (28, 5) (11, 21) (11, 6) (5, 18) (5, 23) (5, 28) (5, 24) (13, 7) (22, 14) (22, 17) (22, 0) (3, 18) (3, 20) (3, 2) (24, 1) (24, 4) (24, 5) (20, 6) (20, 19) (20, 26) (20, 3) (2, 25) (2, 3) (29, 16) (29, 19) (29, 26) 

Response:
Step 1: Identify nodes connected to 3 other nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 21, 24, and 27.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 14, 17, and 0.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 14, 4, and 9.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 17, 4, and 16.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0, 29, and 25.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 16.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 18, 23, and 28.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 6, 19, and 26.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 18, 20, and 2.
  
Step 2: Count the number of 3-stars.
- From the identified nodes, we can form 4 unique 3-stars:
<1, (21, 24, 27)>
<22, (14, 17, 0)>
<15, (14, 4, 9)>
<16, (0, 29, 25)>.
