Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 6) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 13) (17, 15) (4, 8) (4, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 17) (9, 0) (9, 19) (9, 1) (9, 18) (12, 8) (12, 19) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 0) (6, 19) (6, 18) (14, 5) (14, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find the central node and its three adjacent nodes for each potential 3-star.

First, let's identify all nodes that are connected by exactly 3 edges:
- Node 11 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 3, 16).
- Node 16 is connected to 3 nodes (3, 6, 11).
- Node 8 is connected to 3 nodes (4, 12, 13).
- Node 13 is connected to 4 nodes (8, 10, 15, 17).
- Node 10 is connected to 3 nodes (7, 13, 18).
- Node 17 is connected to 2 nodes (13, 15).
- Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes (1, 8).
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes (3, 11, 19).
- Node 3 is connected to 3 nodes (2, 11, 16).
- Node 0 is connected to 3 nodes (6, 7, 9).
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes (0, 5, 10).
- Node 5 is connected to 3 nodes (1, 7, 14).
- Node 19 is connected to 4 nodes (2, 6, 9, 12).
- Node 1 is connected to 3 nodes (4, 5, 14).
- Node 15 is connected to 2 nodes (13, 17).
- Node 9 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 1, 18, 19).
- Node 12 is connected to 2 nodes (8, 19).
- Node 18 is connected to 3 nodes (6, 9, 10).
- Node 6 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 16, 18, 19).
- Node 14 is connected to 2 nodes (1, 5).

Now, we can list the unique 3-stars found:

<11, (2, 3, 16)>
<16, (3, 6, 11)>
<8, (4, 12, 13)>
<10, (7, 13, 18)>
<2, (3, 11, 19)>
<7, (0, 5, 10)>
<5, (1, 7, 14)>
<19, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 14)>
<9, (0, 1, 18)>
<18, (6, 9, 10)>
<6, (0, 16, 18)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
