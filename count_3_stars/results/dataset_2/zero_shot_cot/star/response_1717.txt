Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all occurrences of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's follow these steps:

1. Identify nodes with 3 neighbors:
- Nodes 4 and 1 each have 5 neighbors.
- Nodes 8, 2, and 0 each have 4 neighbors.
- Nodes 5, 9, 6, 3, and 7 each have 3 neighbors.

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- Nodes 5, 9, 6, 3, and 7 can each form a 3-star:
  - <5, (2, 1, 4)>
  - <9, (6, 4, 7)>
  - <6, (9, 1, 3)>
  - <3, (6, 4, 8)>
  - <7, (9, 2, 1)>

3. Count the total number of 3-stars in the given graph:
- [5]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
