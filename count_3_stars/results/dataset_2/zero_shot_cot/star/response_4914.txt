Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 8) (1, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated by examining each node to see how many 3-star configurations it is part of. Let's calculate it step by step:

Node 0 is part of 3-star configurations with the following leaves: 2, 3, 5, 12
Node 1 is part of 1 3-star configuration with leaves: 5
Node 2 is part of 3-star configurations with the following leaves: 4, 7, 8, 10
Node 3 is part of 2 3-star configurations with leaves: 5, 13
Node 4 is part of 1 3-star configuration with leaves: 2
Node 5 is part of 1 3-star configuration with leaves: 1
Node 6 is part of 0 3-star configurations
Node 7 is part of 2 3-star configurations with leaves: 0, 2, 5
Node 8 is part of 3-star configurations with the following leaves: 1, 2, 4
Node 9 is part of 3-star configurations with the following leaves: 7, 8, 11
Node 10 is part of 1 3-star configuration with leaves: 2
Node 11 is part of 2 3-star configurations with leaves: 2, 6, 9, 14
Node 12 is part of 1 3-star configuration with leaves: 0
Node 13 is part of 1 3-star configuration with leaves: 3
Node 14 is part of 1 3-star configuration with leaves: 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [(4 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1)] = [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (2, 5, 12)>
<0, (3, 5, 12)>
<0, (2, 3, 12)>

<3, (5, 13)>
<4, (2)>
<5, (1)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 2, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (7, 8, 11)>
<11, (2, 6, 9)>
