Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
First, we identify the nodes with exactly three connected edges, which will become the centers of the 3-stars. Then, we check the nodes connected to these centers to form the 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 connected edges: 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9

Counting the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 1, 2 <0, (8, 1, 2)>
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 5, 1 <2, (0, 5, 1)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 5, 7 <4, (9, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 0, 2 <5, (8, 0, 2)>
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, 6 <7, (0, 4, 6)>
- Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 0, 3 <8, (5, 0, 3)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 2, 3 <9, (4, 2, 3)>

[The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: 7]
