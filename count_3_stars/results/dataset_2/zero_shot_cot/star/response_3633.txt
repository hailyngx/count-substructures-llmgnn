Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify the 3-stars step-by-step:

1. Node 0 <0, (1, 2, 8)>
2. Node 1 <1, (0, 2, 5)>
3. Node 2 <2, (0, 1, 8)>
4. Node 3 <3, (1, 6, 7)>
5. Node 4 <4, (8, 9, 5)>
6. Node 5 <5, (4, 9, 1)>
7. Node 6 <6, (3, 7, 2)>
8. Node 7 <7, (6, 3, 0)>
9. Node 8 <8, (0, 2, 4)>
10. Node 9 <9, (4, 5, 1)>

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
