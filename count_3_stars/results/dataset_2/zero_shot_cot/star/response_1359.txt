Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (3, 9) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 18) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (16, 17) (16, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (2, 19) (2, 9) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the unique 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1: Connected to nodes 8, 7, 12, 6, 11 (has 5 connections, not a 3-star center)
- Node 4: Connected to nodes 8, 13, 15 (3 connections, potential 3-star center)
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 12, 16, 18 (3 connections, potential 3-star center)
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 17, 4, 0, 1 (4 connections, potential 3-star center)
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 3, 2, 15 (3 connections, potential 3-star center)
- Node 10: Connected to nodes 6, 13, 19 (3 connections, potential 3-star center)
- Node 11: Connected to nodes 1, 19, 18 (3 connections, potential 3-star center)
- Node 12: Connected to nodes 7, 5, 14, 1 (4 connections, potential 3-star center)
- Node 14: Connected to nodes 12, 0, 19, 15 (4 connections, potential 3-star center)
- Node 15: Connected to nodes 4, 0, 14, 9 (4 connections, potential 3-star center)
- Node 16: Connected to nodes 17, 5 (2 connections, not a 3-star center)
- Node 17: Connected to nodes 16, 8 (2 connections, not a 3-star center)
- Node 18: Connected to nodes 11, 5 (2 connections, not a 3-star center)
- Node 19: Connected to nodes 10, 14, 11, 2 (4 connections, potential 3-star center)

2. Construct possible 3-stars:

<4, (8, 13, 15)>
<5, (12, 16, 18)>
<8, (4, 0, 1)>
<9, (3, 2, 15)>
<10, (6, 13, 19)>
<11, (1, 19, 18)>
<12, (7, 5, 14)>
<14, (12, 0, 19)>
<15, (4, 0, 14)>
<19, (10, 14, 11)>
  
Thus, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
