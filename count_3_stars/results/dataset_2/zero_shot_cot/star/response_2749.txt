To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern.

Let's analyze the connections for each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 26.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 29, 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 25.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 16, 19, 18.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 17, 18.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 22, 21, 16.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 28, 7, 12, 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 22, 24.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 12, 24, 27.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 15, 11, 25, 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 15, 26, 13, 16.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 25.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 16, 8.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 10, 9, 14, 24.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 22, 13, 21.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 10, 9, 5.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 3, 18, 5, 10, 12.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 27, 4.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 16, 25.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 29.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 5, 14.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 14.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 29, 27.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 8, 7, 13.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 11, 18, 9, 2.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 0, 10.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 17, 8, 23.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 29, 6.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 1, 20, 28, 23.

By examining the connections, we find the following unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 17, 18)>
<1, (29, 2, 25)>
<2, (1, 25, 11)>
<3, (16, 18, 4)>
<4, (0, 17, 18)>
<5, (15, 22, 21)>
<6, (28, 7, 24)>
<7, (6, 22, 24)>
<8, (11, 12, 24)>
<9, (15, 11, 25)>
<10, (15, 26, 13)>
<11, (9, 8, 25)>
<12, (6, 16, 8)>
<13, (6, 10, 9)>
<14, (22, 13, 21)>
<15, (10, 9, 5)>
<16, (3, 18, 5)>
<17, (27, 4, 18)>
<18, (3, 4, 16)>
<19, (3, 16, 18)>
<20, (29)>
<21, (5, 14)>
<22, (5, 7, 14)>
<23, (29, 27)>
<24, (8, 7, 13)>
<25, (11, 18, 9)>
<26, (0, 10)>
<27, (17, 8, 23)>
<28, (29, 6)>
<29, (1, 20, 28, 23)>

So the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [29].
