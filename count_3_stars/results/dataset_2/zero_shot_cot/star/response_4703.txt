Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 3, 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 4: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 8
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 4, 7

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 6: <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- Node 8: <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 7, 6)>
- Node 9: <9, (2, 4, 7)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
