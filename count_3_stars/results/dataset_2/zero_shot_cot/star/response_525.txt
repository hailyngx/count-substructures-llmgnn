Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's find the 3-stars step by step:
1. Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 8, 4, 0, and 3.
   There are two 3-stars involving node 5: <5, (9, 2, 8)> and <5, (4, 0, 3)>.

2. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 4, 2, and 3.
   There is one 3-star involving node 9: <9, (5, 4, 2)>.

3. Node 6 is connected to node 4.
   Node 6 is not part of any 3-star as it has only one connection.

4. Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 2.
   Node 0 is not part of any 3-star as it has only two connections.

5. Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 1, and 8.
   There is one 3-star involving node 7: <7, (3, 1, 8)>.

6. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 2, 7, and 8.
   There is one 3-star involving node 1: <1, (9, 2, 7)>.

7. Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 7, 4, and 8.
   There are three 3-stars involving node 3: <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 5)>, and <3, (7, 8, 4)>.

8. Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 1, and 3.
   Node 8 is not part of any 3-star as it has only four connections.

9. Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 6, 2, and 3.
   There are three 3-stars involving node 4: <4, (5, 9, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, and <4, (9, 3, 5)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
The unique 3-stars are <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <5, (4, 0, 3)>, <9, (5, 4, 2)>, <7, (3, 1, 8)>, <1, (9, 2, 7)>, <3, (5, 9, 7)>, <3, (4, 8, 5)>, <3, (7, 8, 4)>, and <4, (5, 9, 6)>.
