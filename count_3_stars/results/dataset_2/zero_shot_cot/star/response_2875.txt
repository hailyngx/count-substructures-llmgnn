Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 5) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

There are two unique 3-stars in this graph:
<1, (2, 10, 11)>
<7, (4, 9, 13)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2].
