Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the graph:

- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <6, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 3, 8)>
- <8, (2, 4, 6)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-star configurations, we get a total of [10] 3-stars in the graph.
