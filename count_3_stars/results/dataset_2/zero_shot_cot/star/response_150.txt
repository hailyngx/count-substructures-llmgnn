Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 3) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 9) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can identify each 3-star pattern. 
Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have 3 edges emanating from them. 

After analyzing the provided information, we can determine the 3-stars as follows:

<2, (8, 7, 13)>
<3, (8, 5, 10)>
<6, (12, 1, 0)>
<11, (3, 1, 9)>
<13, (6, 2, 14)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is counted as [5].
