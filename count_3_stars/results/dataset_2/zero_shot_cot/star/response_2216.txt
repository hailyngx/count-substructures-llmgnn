Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 23) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 28) (9, 16) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 29) (25, 3) (25, 13) (25, 18) (25, 10) (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 27) (8, 6) (8, 20) (8, 17) (13, 25) (13, 4) (0, 27) (0, 28) (0, 2) (27, 21) (27, 0) (27, 2) (22, 26) (22, 11) (26, 22) (26, 24) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 23) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 12) (24, 1) (1, 24) (1, 14) (1, 10) (17, 8) (17, 4) (18, 25) (18, 26) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 15) (23, 6) (23, 7) (23, 26) (16, 9) (16, 7) (5, 26) (5, 29) (15, 6) (15, 11) (15, 19) (19, 11) (19, 15) (19, 12) (29, 3) (29, 7) (29, 5) (28, 9) (28, 0) (12, 24) (12, 19) (12, 14) (20, 8) (20, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 10) (10, 25) (10, 1) (10, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 20) (2, 14) 

Response:
First, let's identify the potential 3-stars in the given graph. 
Since a 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes, we look for nodes with three incident edges. 

Here are the potential 3-stars:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 15, 2, 23, and 8
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 6, 28, and 16
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 24, and 29
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 3, 13, and 18
- Node 7 has more than three incident edges
- Node 21 has more than three incident edges
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 20, and 17
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 25, 4, and 0
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 27, 28, and 2
- Node 27 has more than three incident edges
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 26, and 11
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 22, 24, and 18
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 3, 26, and 12
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 24, 14, and 10
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, and 4
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 25, and 26
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 22, 19, and 15
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 26
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 9, and 7
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 26, and 29
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 6, 11, and 19
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 11, 15, and 12
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 5
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 9, and 0
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 24, 19, and 14
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 8, and 2
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 1, 12, and 2
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 13, 17, and 10
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 25, 1, and 4
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 0, 27, 20, and 14

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

[<6, (9, 15, 2)>, <6, (9, 15, 8)>, <6, (9, 2, 23)>, <6, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (15, 2, 23)>, <6, (15, 2, 8)>, <9, (6, 28, 16)>, <3, (25, 24, 29)>, <25, (3, 13, 18)>, <13, (25, 4, 0)>, <0, (27, 28, 2)>, <22, (26, 11, 22)>, <26, (24, 18, 26)>, <24, (3, 26, 12)>, <1, (24, 14, 10)>, <17, (8, 4, 17)>, <4, (13, 10, 4)>, <11, (22, 19, 15)>, <23, (7, 6, 23)>, <19, (15, 12, 19)>, <29, (3, 7, 29)>, <12, (24, 19, 12)>, <20, (8, 2, 20)>, <14, (1, 12, 14)>, <10, (25, 1, 10)>, <2, (6, 0, 2)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].
