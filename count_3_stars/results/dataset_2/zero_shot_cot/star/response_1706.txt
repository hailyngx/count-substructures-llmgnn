Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars present. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Node 13 has the edges (13, 22), (13, 5), (13, 2), (13, 29).
   So, the 3-stars involving node 13 are:
   <13, (22, 5, 2)>
   <13, (22, 5, 29)>
   [2]

2. Node 22 has the edges (22, 13), (22, 23), (22, 24).
   So, the 3-stars involving node 22 are:
   <22, (13, 23, 24)> - already counted above with 13
   [0]

3. Node 6 has the edges (6, 18), (6, 20).
   So, the 3-stars involving node 6 are:
   [0]
