Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 11) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (10, 13) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify each unique 3-star pattern where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (7, 14, 2)>
2. <1, (4, 3, 2)>
3. <2, (1, 6, 10)>
4. <3, (4, 1, 11)>
5. <4, (1, 7, 5)>
6. <5, (4, 7, 11)>
7. <6, (8, 14, 2)>
8. <7, (4, 5, 12)>
9. <8, (6, 13, 9)>
10. <9, (3, 8, 11)>
11. <10, (12, 13, 2)>
12. <11, (4, 3, 5)>
13. <12, (7, 1, 9)>
14. <13, (8, 10, 2)>
15. <14, (0, 6, 9)>

Now, let's count the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph.
