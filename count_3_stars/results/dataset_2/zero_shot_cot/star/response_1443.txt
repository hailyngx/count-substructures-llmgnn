Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 25) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 15) (22, 23) (22, 10) (22, 7) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 19) (10, 17) (10, 22) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 2) (4, 14) (4, 8) (4, 25) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 18) (21, 10) (21, 19) (28, 26) (28, 27) (19, 23) (19, 21) (19, 26) (19, 7) (19, 1) (26, 28) (26, 19) (26, 20) (13, 5) (13, 29) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 25) (1, 19) (1, 11) (15, 17) (15, 13) (6, 29) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 20) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 12) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 29) (16, 0) (16, 24) (16, 20) (25, 14) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 28) (27, 25) (24, 16) (24, 18) (18, 23) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 24) (20, 26) (20, 11) (20, 16) (29, 13) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 25) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 9) (7, 22) (7, 19) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node with exactly three edges. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars. 

The nodes that are connected to the central node (degree 3) are: 2, 4, 8, 15, 18, 20, 21, 25.

Next, let's check each of these nodes with degree 3 to see if they form a 3-star with the central node. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<10, (17, 22, 21)>
<19, (23, 1, 26)>
<26, (28, 20, 19)>
<2, (17, 5, 10)>
<25, (14, 4, 27)>
<18, (23, 5, 24)>
<21, (10, 19, 7)>

There are 7 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
