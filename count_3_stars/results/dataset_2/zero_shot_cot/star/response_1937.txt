Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 14) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 12) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 12) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 11) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star graph should have exactly three edges. Let's examine each node to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0: (0, 13), (0, 7), (0, 11), (0, 12) -> This node forms a 3-star. <0, (13, 7, 11)>
- Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 11), (1, 10) -> This node forms a 3-star. <1, (5, 11, 10)>
- Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 3) -> This node forms a 3-star. <2, (5, 6, 3)>
- Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 2) -> This node forms a 3-star. <3, (9, 7, 2)>
- Node 4: (4, 9), (4, 14) -> This node does not form a 3-star.
- Node 5: (5, 9), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 1), (5, 10) -> This node forms a 3-star. <5, (9, 2, 8)>
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 7), (6, 10), (6, 2) -> This node forms a 3-star. <6, (9, 7, 10)>
- Node 7: (7, 6), (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 13), (7, 0) -> This node forms a 3-star. <7, (6, 3, 8)>
- Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 13), (8, 7) -> This node forms a 3-star. <8, (5, 13, 7)>
- Node 9: (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 4), (9, 14), (9, 3) -> This node forms a 3-star. <9, (5, 6, 4)>
- Node 10: (10, 5), (10, 6), (10, 1), (10, 13), (10, 12) -> This node forms a 3-star. <10, (5, 6, 1)>
- Node 11: (11, 1), (11, 0), (11, 12), (11, 14) -> This node does not form a 3-star.
- Node 12: (12, 13), (12, 0), (12, 2), (12, 10), (12, 11) -> This node forms a 3-star. <12, (13, 0, 2)>
- Node 13: (13, 8), (13, 12), (13, 10), (13, 7), (13, 0) -> This node forms a 3-star. <13, (8, 12, 10)>
- Node 14: (14, 9), (14, 4), (14, 11) -> This node forms a 3-star. <14, (9, 4, 11)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9]. 
Therefore, the unique 3-stars found are <0, (13, 7, 11)>, <1, (5, 11, 10)>, <2, (5, 6, 3)>, <3, (9, 7, 2)>, <5, (9, 2, 8)>, <6, (9, 7, 10)>, <7, (6, 3, 8)>, <8, (5, 13, 7)>, <12, (13, 0, 2)>
