Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 13) (3, 23) (25, 3) (25, 26) (25, 15) (8, 27) (13, 3) (13, 17) (7, 21) (7, 12) (21, 7) (21, 16) (22, 9) (22, 5) (22, 12) (22, 1) (23, 3) (23, 29) (23, 0) (23, 9) (4, 24) (4, 16) (4, 26) (4, 2) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 1) (17, 13) (17, 29) (17, 15) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 6) (10, 6) (9, 22) (9, 23) (26, 25) (26, 4) (26, 0) (16, 21) (16, 4) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 27) (28, 5) (5, 22) (5, 28) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 24) (14, 27) (14, 24) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 11) (0, 23) (0, 26) (11, 18) (11, 24) (11, 1) (11, 20) (24, 4) (24, 19) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 27) (1, 22) (1, 12) (1, 28) (1, 11) (6, 29) (6, 10) (20, 11) (20, 27) (27, 8) (27, 28) (27, 14) (27, 24) (27, 20) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 5) (15, 18) (15, 2) (2, 4) (2, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to look for nodes with exactly three neighbors.

First, let's list the nodes and their neighbors:

Node 0: 23, 26
Node 1: 11, 12, 22, 28
Node 2: 4, 15
Node 3: 13, 23, 25
Node 4: 2, 16, 24, 26
Node 5: 15, 19, 22, 28
Node 6: 10, 29
Node 7: 12, 16, 21
Node 8: 27
Node 9: 22, 23
Node 10: 6
Node 11: 1, 20, 24
Node 12: 1, 7, 22
Node 13: 3, 17
Node 14: 24, 27
Node 15: 2, 5, 17, 18, 25
Node 16: 4, 7, 21, 28
Node 17: 13, 15, 29
Node 18: 15, 19, 11
Node 19: 5, 18, 24
Node 20: 11, 27
Node 21: 7, 16
Node 22: 1, 5, 9, 12
Node 23: 0, 3, 9
Node 24: 4, 11, 14, 19, 27
Node 25: 3, 15, 25
Node 26: 4, 0, 25
Node 27: 8, 14, 20, 24, 28
Node 28: 1, 5, 16, 27
Node 29: 6, 17, 23

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
<0, (23, 26, 9)>
<2, (4, 15, 5)>
<6, (10, 29, 17)>
<8, (27, 14, 20)>
<7, (12, 16, 21)>
<13, (3, 23, 17)>
<18, (15, 19, 11)>
<5, (15, 22, 28)>
<1, (11, 12, 22)>
<10, (6, 29, 17)>
<9, (22, 23, 0)>
<4, (2, 16, 24)>
<3, (13, 23, 25)>

Counting the unique 3-stars gives us a total of [13].
