Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 1) (9, 0) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 22) (15, 4) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 22) (22, 15) (22, 18) (22, 17) (22, 7) (22, 25) (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 27) (13, 3) (13, 8) (20, 25) (20, 23) (20, 10) (25, 22) (25, 20) (25, 21) (2, 5) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 8) (1, 26) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 14) (26, 4) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 28) (19, 12) (11, 2) (28, 2) (28, 19) (28, 10) (24, 6) (24, 14) (4, 15) (4, 26) (27, 8) (27, 14) (27, 16) (7, 22) (7, 1) (7, 16) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 27) (16, 27) (16, 7) (16, 17) (6, 24) (17, 22) (17, 16) (17, 0) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 21) (21, 25) (21, 19) (21, 0) (21, 12) (10, 3) (10, 20) (10, 28) (10, 29) (12, 19) (12, 21) (12, 29) (23, 20) (23, 2) (29, 10) (29, 12) 

Response:
Let's first identify 3-star structures in the graph:

<1, (5, 8, 15)>
<2, (5, 2, 23)>
<3, (15, 4, 13)>
<4, (26, 4, 15)>
<5, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (24, 6, 14)>
<7, (1, 7, 22)>
<8, (1, 8, 27)>
<9, (0, 9, 17)>
<10, (10, 20, 28)>
<11, (2, 11, 23)>
<12, (12, 21, 29)>
<13, (3, 8, 13)>
<14, (14, 16, 27)>
<15, (4, 15, 26)>
<16, (7, 16, 22)>
<17, (0, 17, 22)>
<18, (5, 15, 18)>
<19, (19, 21, 26)>
<20, (20, 21, 25)>

The total count of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
