Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (9, 6, 4)>
2. <1, (5, 9, 7)>
3. <2, (6, 0, 3)>
4. <3, (6, 7, 2)>
5. <4, (9, 6, 8)>
6. <5, (9, 1, 7)>

Therefore, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph.
