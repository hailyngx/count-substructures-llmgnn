Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 5) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 17) (5, 2) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 1) (13, 15) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 18) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, let's first identify all the 3-stars present in the graph:

<0, (2, 3, 18)>
<1, (12, 13, 15)>
<2, (0, 5, 11)>
<3, (0, 9, 17)>
<6, (12, 16, 18)>
<7, (11, 15, 7)>
<8, (14, 18, 19)>
<9, (3, 9, 17)>
<10, (2, 10, 12)>
<11, (2, 7, 10)>
<12, (1, 10, 6)>
<13, (1, 15, 13)>
<14, (3, 14, 19)>
<15, (7, 11, 13)>
<16, (6, 10, 16)>
<17, (3, 9, 19)>
<18, (0, 6, 8)>
<19, (6, 8, 14)>

Now let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
