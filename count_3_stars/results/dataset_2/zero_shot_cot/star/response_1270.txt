Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the 3-stars by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars in the graph: 
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<9, (8, 3, 1)>
<4, (0, 3, 1)>
<7, (9, 6, 8)>
<1, (9, 4, 3)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<6, (5, 7, 2)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<8, (5, 9, 6)>
<0, (5, 4, 8)>

After listing all the 3-stars, we count that there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
