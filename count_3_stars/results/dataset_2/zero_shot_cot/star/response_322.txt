Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 1, and 3. This forms a 3-star.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 0. This forms a 3-star.
- Node 6 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.
- Node 2 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 2, and 0. This forms a 3-star.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 8. This forms a 3-star.
- Node 7 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.
- Node 1 is not part of any 3-star as it has more than 3 connections.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 6. This forms a 3-star.
- Node 4 is not part of any 3-star as it has only one connection.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars in the given graph are: 
<5, (9, 1, 3)>, <9, (5, 3, 0)>, <8, (6, 2, 0)>, and <0, (9, 2, 8)>, <3, (5, 9, 6)>.

Since there are 5 unique 3-stars, the final answer is: [5].
