Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 9) (4, 9) (4, 13) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 4) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star structures in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 7, 11)>
<7, (3, 8, 12)>
<12, (1, 7, 9)>
<2, (8, 10, 14)>
<8, (7, 2, 6)>
<11, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (9, 4, -)>
<4, (9, 13, -)>
<6, (1, 8, 11)>
<14, (2, 6, 13)>
<9, (3, 7, 12)>
<13, (2, 4, 14)>
<5, (1, 11, -)>
<10, (3, 8, 6)>

Counting the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we have a total of [14] 3-stars.
