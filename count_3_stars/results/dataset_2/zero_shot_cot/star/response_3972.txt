Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the nodes with three edges connected to them, which are potential central nodes of 3-stars. 
These nodes are: 0, 2, 3, 5.

Now, let's find the 3-stars with these potential central nodes: 
- For node 0:
  - <0, (5, 8, 7)>
  - <0, (5, 8, 2)>
  - Total: 2

- For node 2:
  - <2, (7, 0, 3)>
  - <2, (7, 0, 6)>
  - Total: 2

- For node 3:
  - <3, (7, 2, 6)>
  - Total: 1

- For node 5:
  - <5, (9, 8, 0)>
  - Total: 1

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
