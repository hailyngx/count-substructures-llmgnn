Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The central nodes are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Let's list the 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<7, (0, 3, 6)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<9, (0, 7, 1)>

There are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
