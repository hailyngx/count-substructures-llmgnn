Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 17) (16, 4) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 14) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 19) (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 17) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (17, 16) (17, 1) (17, 10) (8, 11) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 18) (13, 14) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 12) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 15) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 2) (6, 19) (6, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 11.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 9, and 17.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 14, and 19.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 16.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 10.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 12 and 19.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 9, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 9, and 11.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 17.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 0, 8, and 15.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 18.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 11, 14, and 2.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 4 and 17.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 1, 10, and 16.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 8, 12, and 19.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 18.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars:
[<0, (1, 11, 8)>, <1, (0, 9, 17)>, <3, (10, 14, 19)>, <4, (5, 7, 16)>, <5, (4, 8, 10)>, <6, (12, 19, 18)>, <7, (4, 9, 14)>, <8, (5, 9, 11)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <10, (3, 5, 17)>, <11, (0, 8, 15)>, <12, (6, 9, 18)>, <14, (3, 7, 15)>, <15, (11, 14, 2)>, <16, (4, 17)>, <17, (1, 10, 16)>, <18, (8, 12, 19)>, <19, (3, 6, 18)>]
