Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 7) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 26) (21, 25) (2, 23) (2, 10) (29, 16) (29, 25) (3, 15) (3, 24) (3, 10) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 5) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (20, 3) (20, 7) (20, 22) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 12) (28, 13) (26, 21) (26, 28) (26, 7) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 27) (25, 21) (25, 29) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (12, 28) (12, 8) (12, 11) (19, 4) (19, 6) (22, 20) (22, 16) (22, 24) (11, 4) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 24) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 24) (6, 27) (6, 19) (7, 1) (7, 20) (7, 26) (7, 14) (7, 5) (24, 3) (24, 22) (24, 14) (24, 10) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 10) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 23) (23, 2) (23, 0) (23, 16) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 28) (5, 15) (5, 17) (5, 7) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star. Since a 3-star consists of a center node and three other nodes connected to it, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 1, 28, and 27
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 21, 26, and 12
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 26, 21, and 9
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 21, 28, and 7
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 17, 18, and 23

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by considering the identified nodes as centers of 3-stars and counting the possible combinations of three other connected nodes for each center.

Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars: 
<21, (1, 28, 27)>
<28, (21, 26, 12)>
<27, (26, 21, 9)>
<26, (21, 28, 7)>
<0, (17, 18, 23)>
