Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 12) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for each node that is connected to exactly three other nodes. We will list the unique 3-stars found below:

<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 13)>
<3, (4, 9, 10)>
<4, (3, 5, 12)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<6, (0, 2, 12)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 10)>
<9, (1, 3, 14)>
<10, (3, 8, 14)>
<11, (4, 14, 12)>
