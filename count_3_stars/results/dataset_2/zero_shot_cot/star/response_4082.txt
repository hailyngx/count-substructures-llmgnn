Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, which are potential centers of 3-stars.

The potential centers are:  
- Node 0 (connected to 1, 4, 5, and 6)
- Node 2 (connected to 6, 7, and 8)
- Node 3 (connected to 1, 7, and 4)
- Node 9 (connected to 6, 7, and 5)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph.
