Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 12) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 4) (29, 21) (4, 29) (4, 7) (4, 24) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 22) (7, 26) (18, 2) (18, 20) (18, 24) (5, 25) (5, 21) (6, 14) (6, 3) (15, 13) (15, 11) (20, 18) (19, 1) (19, 27) (26, 7) (26, 22) (26, 3) (22, 7) (22, 26) (22, 8) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 23) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 13) (10, 13) (10, 25) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 12) (17, 13) (17, 23) (8, 22) (8, 24) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 27) (21, 29) (21, 5) (21, 9) (21, 23) (25, 5) (25, 10) (25, 16) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 9) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 27) (24, 4) (24, 18) (24, 8) (24, 1) (9, 21) (9, 12) (9, 11) (27, 29) (27, 19) (27, 16) (27, 11) (27, 28) (28, 0) (28, 27) (3, 6) (3, 26) (1, 19) (1, 24) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Taking a closer look at each node:
- Node 2 is connected to 3 nodes (29, 18, 12)
- Node 4 is connected to 3 nodes (29, 7, 16)
- Node 7 is connected to 3 nodes (4, 14, 22)
- Node 13 is connected to 3 nodes (15, 14, 12)
- Node 16 is connected to 3 nodes (4, 0, 25)
- Node 24 is connected to 3 nodes (4, 18, 8)
- Node 27 is connected to 3 nodes (29, 19, 16)

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (29, 18, 12)>
<4, (29, 7, 16)>
<7, (4, 14, 22)>
<13, (15, 14, 12)>
<16, (4, 0, 25)>
<24, (4, 18, 8)>
<27, (29, 19, 16)>
