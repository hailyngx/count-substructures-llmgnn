Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 18) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (10, 5) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 18) (9, 12) (15, 0) (2, 17) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 13) (12, 3) (16, 12) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 0) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 3) (13, 14) (13, 12) (6, 19) (6, 11) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 6) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 14 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 8, and 13: <14, (17, 8, 13)>
2. Node 17 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 1, and 2: <17, (14, 1, 2)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 4, and 11: <8, (14, 4, 11)>
4. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 10, and 18: <7, (3, 10, 18)>
5. Node 10 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 5, and 18: <10, (7, 5, 18)>
6. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 19, and 9: <1, (17, 19, 9)>
7. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 10, 19, and 2: <5, (10, 19, 2)>
8. Node 19 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 6: <19, (1, 5, 6)>
9. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 1, and 18: <9, (8, 1, 18)>
10. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 17, 5, and 12: <2, (17, 5, 12)>
11. Node 12 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 2, and 16: <12, (9, 2, 16)>
12. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 12, and 0: <3, (7, 12, 0)>
13. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 15, 2, and 3: <0, (15, 2, 3)>
14. Node 13 forms a 3-star with nodes 14, 12, and 0: <13, (14, 12, 0)>
15. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 19, 11, and 2: <6, (19, 11, 2)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
