Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 14) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 8) (21, 25) (21, 22) (8, 21) (8, 13) (8, 26) (13, 8) (13, 25) (13, 14) (13, 18) (23, 11) (23, 7) (23, 0) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 11) (20, 15) (20, 16) (17, 19) (17, 18) (29, 0) (29, 22) (29, 10) (26, 1) (26, 8) (26, 5) (26, 3) (5, 26) (11, 23) (11, 15) (11, 22) (11, 4) (25, 21) (25, 13) (27, 21) (3, 26) (3, 28) (3, 22) (28, 1) (28, 3) (28, 9) (6, 24) (6, 18) (6, 16) (6, 12) (6, 4) (24, 6) (24, 16) (24, 0) (24, 9) (12, 6) (12, 9) (18, 13) (18, 17) (18, 6) (18, 10) (19, 15) (19, 17) (7, 23) (16, 20) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 10) (0, 23) (0, 15) (0, 29) (0, 24) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 4) (22, 21) (22, 29) (22, 11) (22, 3) (10, 29) (10, 18) (10, 16) (9, 28) (9, 24) (9, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify all the possible 3-stars in the graph by looking at each node's connections:

1. Find the nodes with exactly three edges connected to them.
2. Check if these nodes are arranged in a star pattern with one central node.

Here are the 3-stars identified in the graph:

<1, (14, 26, 28)>
<21, (1, 8, 27)>
<8, (21, 13, 26)>
<13, (8, 14, 25)>
<15, (0, 11, 20)>
<20, (15, 16, 17)>
<19, (15, 17, 18)>
<29, (0, 10, 22)>
<26, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (22, 26, 28)>
<6, (4, 12, 16)>
<16, (6, 10, 24)>
<0, (15, 23, 24)>
<14, (1, 4, 13)>
<22, (3, 11, 29)>
<10, (16, 18, 29)>
<9, (24, 28, 9)>
<4, (6, 11, 14)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [18] 3-stars in this graph.
