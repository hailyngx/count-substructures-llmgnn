Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph can be calculated as follows:

1. Since each 3-star includes a central node and 3 leaf nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly 3 neighbors.
2. From the list of edges, we can count the degree of each node as follows:  
   - Node 0: 4
   - Node 1: 3
   - Node 2: 4
   - Node 3: 4
   - Node 4: 4
   - Node 5: 5
   - Node 6: 3
   - Node 7: 5
   - Node 8: 3
   - Node 9: 5
3. Counting the nodes with a degree of 3, we find that there are 4 such nodes: 1, 6, 8, and 9.
4. For each of these nodes, we can check if they form a 3-star.
5. Let's list the unique 3-stars:

   - <1, (9, 3, 4)>
   - <6, (9, 2, 8)>
   - <8, (9, 6, 0)>
   - <9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [(4)].
