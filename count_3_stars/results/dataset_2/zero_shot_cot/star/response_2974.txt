Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 16) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (3, 14) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 17) (13, 8) (13, 6) (6, 13) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 19) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 18) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 6) (18, 4) (0, 14) (0, 1) (7, 11) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 1) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 19) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 7) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 12) (12, 5) (12, 19) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 10) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars present in the given graph:

1. <9, (10, 11, 18)>
2. <14, (0, 1, 17)>
3. <3, (15, 18, 19)>
4. <17, (13, 14, 16)>
5. <6, (2, 18, 19)>

Count of 3-stars: [5]
