Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find all the 3-stars in the given graph. 

Here is the list of 3-stars in the graph:

<6, (9, 5, 1)>
<9, (6, 2, 3)>
<4, (7, 0, 5)>
<7, (9, 4, 8)>
<1, (6, 3, 2)>
<3, (9, 4, 1)>
<5, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (9, 4, 1)>
<2, (6, 9, 4)>

To find the number of unique 3-stars, we count the unique central nodes, ignoring the leaf nodes. 

So, the number of unique 3-stars is 9. 

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
