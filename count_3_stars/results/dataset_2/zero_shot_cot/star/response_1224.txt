Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them. These nodes could potentially be the centers of 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 edges connected to them:
- Node 0 has edges to nodes 4, 7, 1, 3, 5, 2
- Node 2 has edges to nodes 3, 8, 6, 9, 0
- Node 3 has edges to nodes 0, 6, 2
- Node 5 has edges to nodes 4, 1, 6, 0
- Node 6 has edges to nodes 1, 3, 5, 2
- Node 8 has edges to nodes 4, 2, 9
- Node 9 has edges to nodes 4, 7, 1, 8, 2

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

- From node 0: <0, (4, 3, 5)>, <0, (4, 5, 2)>, <0, (4, 1, 6)>
- From node 2: <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 0)> 
- From node 3: <3, (0, 6, 2)>
- From node 5: <5, (4, 1, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 0)>
- From node 6: <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 5, 0)>, <6, (3, 5, 2)>
- From node 8: <8, (4, 9, 2)>
- From node 9: <9, (4, 8, 1)>, <9, (4, 1, 2)>, <9, (4, 2, 7)>

Counting each unique 3-star once, we have a total of [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
