Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Let's denote the nodes as follows:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Looking at the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (6, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 9, 6)>
<7, (9, 0, 3)>
<1, (5, 9, 4)>
<3, (7, 6, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 3)>
<6, (5, 4, 1)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (9, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9], and the unique 3-stars identified are <<5, (6, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 9, 6)>, <7, (9, 0, 3)>, <1, (5, 9, 4)>, <3, (7, 6, 8)>, <8, (5, 7, 3)>, <6, (5, 4, 1)>, <2, (5, 9, 7)>, <0, (9, 7, 8)>>.
