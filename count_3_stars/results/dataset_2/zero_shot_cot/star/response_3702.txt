Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 15) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (17, 14) (17, 18) (6, 18) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 19) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 15) (10, 2) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 10) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 6) (19, 11) (19, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, making them potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes with degree 3 are: 3, 6, 8, 12, 17, 18

Let's check each of these nodes to see if they are part of any 3-stars.

1. For node 3:
   - Node 3 is connected to: 7, 14, 13, 12
   - Node 7 is also connected to nodes 0 and 11, which together with Node 3 form a 3-star: <3, (7, 0, 11)>
   - In total, there is 1 3-star involving Node 3.

2. For node 6:
   - Node 6 is connected to: 18, 0, 4
   - Node 18 is also connected to nodes 11 and 17, which together with Node 6 form a 3-star: <6, (18, 11, 17)>
   - In total, there is 1 3-star involving Node 6.

3. For node 8:
   - Node 8 is connected to: 5
   - Node 5 is also connected to nodes 4, 13, and 0, but they do not form a 3-star with Node 8.
   - There are no 3-stars involving Node 8.

4. For node 12:
   - Node 12 is connected to: 4, 2, 3
   - Node 2 is also connected to nodes 13 and 10, but they do not form a 3-star with Node 12.
   - There are no 3-stars involving Node 12.

5. For node 17:
   - Node 17 is connected to: 14, 18
   - Node 14 is also connected to nodes 3 and 1, but they do not form a 3-star with Node 17.
   - There are no 3-stars involving Node 17.

6. For node 18:
   - Node 18 is connected to: 11, 17, 6
   - Node 11 is also connected to nodes 16 and 19, but they do not form a 3-star with Node 18.
   - There are no additional 3-stars involving Node 18.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].

Unique 3-stars found:
<3, (7, 0, 11)>, <6, (18, 11, 17)>
