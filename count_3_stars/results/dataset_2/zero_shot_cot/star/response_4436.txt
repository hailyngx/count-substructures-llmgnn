Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 5
- Node 3: degree 5
- Node 4: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
- <0, (9, 1, 5)>
- <1, (9, 0, 4)>
- <2, (9, 5, 3)>
- <3, (9, 2, 5)>
- <4, (8, 1, 3)>
- <5, (8, 0, 2)>
- <7, (8, 1, 2)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we get a total of [7].
