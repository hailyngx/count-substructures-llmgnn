Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 11) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 8) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 0: (0, 9, 14)
- Node 1: (1, 11, 14)
- Node 2: (2, 9, 12)
- Node 3: (3, 6, 14) 
- Node 4: (4, 5, 7)
- Node 6: (6, 9, 7)
- Node 8: (8, 9, 12)
- Node 10: (10, 4, 14)
- Node 11: (11, 1, 8)
- Node 13: (13, 4, 6)

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [10].
