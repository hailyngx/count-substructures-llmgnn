Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are directly connected to each node in the graph:

Node 0: {3, 6, 9}
Node 1: {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}
Node 2: {1, 5, 6, 7}
Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8}
Node 4: {3, 5, 8}
Node 5: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 5, 9}
Node 7: {2}
Node 8: {3, 4, 9}
Node 9: {0, 1, 6, 8}

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Number of 3-stars = [5]

Unique 3-stars: 
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
