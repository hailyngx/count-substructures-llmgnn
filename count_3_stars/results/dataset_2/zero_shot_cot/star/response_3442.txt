This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 7) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes in the graph.

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph step by step:

1. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 8, and 11.
   - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <1, (2, 3, 8)>
   - <1, (2, 3, 11)>
   - <1, (4, 3, 8)>
   - <1, (4, 3, 11)>
   - <1, (8, 3, 11)>
   [6]  

2. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 13.
   - <3, (1, 9, 13)>
   [1]

3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, and 13.
   - <8, (0, 1, 2)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 6)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 7)>
   - <8, (0, 1, 13)>
   - <8, (0, 2, 6)>
   - <8, (0, 2, 7)>
   - <8, (0, 2, 13)>
   - <8, (7, 1, 2)>
   - <8, (7, 1, 6)>
   - <8, (7, 1, 13)>
   - <8, (7, 2, 6)>
   - <8, (7, 2, 13)>
   - <8, (13, 1, 2)>
   - <8, (13, 1, 6)>
   - <8, (13, 2, 6)>
   [15]

4. Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
   - <13, (3, 7, 8)>
   [1]

5. Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 11, and 12.
   - <6, (4, 8, 11)>
   [1]

6. Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 8, and 12.
   - <2, (0, 1, 8)>
   [1]

7. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 8, and 9.
   - <0, (2, 7, 8)>
   [1]

8. Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 8, 13, and 14.
   - <7, (0, 5, 8)>
   - <7, (0, 5, 13)>
   - <7, (0, 14, 8)>
   - <7, (0, 14, 13)>
   - <7, (5, 14, 8)>
   [5]

9. Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 9, and 14.
   - <4, (1, 9, 14)>
   [1]

10. Node 12 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 9, and 14.
   - <12, (2, 9, 14)>
   [1]

11. Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 11, 12, and 13.
   - <9, (0, 11, 12)>
   - <9, (0, 11, 13)>
   - <9, (0, 12, 13)>
   - <9, (4, 11, 12)>
   - <9, (4, 11, 13)>
   - <9, (4, 12, 13)>
   - <9, (11, 12, 13)>
   [7]

12. Node 14 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 12, and 4.
   - <14, (4, 5, 7)>
   [1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [34].
