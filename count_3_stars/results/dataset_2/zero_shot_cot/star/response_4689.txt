Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 1) (26, 19) (26, 15) (26, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 24) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 29) (15, 26) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 2) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 14) (22, 14) (22, 10) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 4) (20, 29) (20, 11) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 29) (25, 2) (0, 26) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 12) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 12) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 25) (19, 28) (11, 21) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 18) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 10) (10, 15) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 1) (10, 13) (29, 3) (29, 20) (29, 25) (13, 10) (13, 4) (17, 25) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 16) (2, 15) (2, 23) (2, 25) (2, 4) (2, 27) (4, 23) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 24) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 4) (18, 11) (18, 28) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 10) (27, 2) (27, 16) (8, 6) (16, 6) (16, 27) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (5, 10, 9)>
<4, (2, 24, 13)>

Now we count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [2].
