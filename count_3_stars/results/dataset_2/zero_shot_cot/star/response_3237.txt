Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 14) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's start by listing all the possible 3-stars:

<0, (6, 11, 12)>
<1, (6, 8, 14)>
<2, (9, 0, 12)>
<3, (9, 7, 10)>
<4, (10, 4, 13)>
<5, (8, 4, 5)>
<6, (0, 1, 12)>
<7, (11, 3, 13)>
<8, (9, 1, 5)>
<9, (3, 7, 10)>
<10, (4, 5, 9)>
<11, (6, 0, 12)>
<12, (0, 6, 2)>
<13, (4, 7, 12)>
<14, (1, 5, 14)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars found, we have a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
