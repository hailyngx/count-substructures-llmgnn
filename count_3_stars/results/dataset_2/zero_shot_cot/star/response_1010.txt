Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (16, 17) (13, 22) (13, 20) (13, 24) (13, 18) (22, 13) (22, 27) (22, 10) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 14) (9, 29) (9, 2) (9, 15) (0, 20) (0, 21) (0, 26) (20, 13) (20, 0) (20, 26) (20, 14) (28, 11) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 2) (24, 13) (24, 28) (24, 4) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 2) (26, 27) (1, 15) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 19) (1, 8) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 23) (15, 7) (29, 9) (29, 1) (29, 7) (29, 27) (10, 22) (10, 21) (10, 12) (10, 18) (21, 5) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 23) (19, 1) (19, 15) (7, 28) (7, 15) (7, 29) (2, 9) (2, 28) (2, 26) (2, 4) (4, 24) (4, 2) (17, 16) (27, 22) (27, 26) (27, 29) (23, 15) (23, 21) (23, 14) (23, 25) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 6) (6, 12) (25, 1) (25, 23) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 8) (8, 1) (8, 18) (14, 5) (14, 20) (14, 23) (14, 12) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 13 is connected to (22, 20, 24).
2. Node 20 is connected to (0, 26, 14).
3. Node 28 is connected to (11, 7, 24).
4. Node 24 is connected to (13, 28, 4).
5. Node 21 is connected to (5, 0, 10).
6. Node 15 is connected to (9, 1, 19).
7. Node 29 is connected to (9, 1, 7).
8. Node 22 is connected to (13, 27, 10).
9. Node 1 is connected to (15, 29, 25).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars are:
<13, (22, 20, 24)>
<20, (0, 26, 14)>
<28, (11, 7, 24)>
<24, (13, 28, 4)>
<21, (5, 0, 10)>
<15, (9, 1, 19)>
<29, (9, 1, 7)>
<22, (13, 27, 10)>
<1, (15, 29, 25)>
