Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes are the center nodes of the 3-stars in this graph. Nodes with degree 3 are potential center nodes. They should be connected to exactly three other nodes. 

From the provided edges, we can see that nodes 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 5 all have a degree of 3. We will now find the 3-stars in the graph.

After examining the edges, we find the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>

There are 8 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [8].
