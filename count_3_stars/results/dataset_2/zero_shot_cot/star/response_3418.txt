Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-star graphs in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list all the 3-stars found in the graph:

<5, (8, 4, 7)>
<9, (6, 8, 2)>
<4, (5, 7, 0)>
<7, (5, 9, 4)>
<6, (9, 7, 3)>
<1, (7, 3, 0)>
<3, (4, 6, 1)>
<8, (5, 9, 0)>
<2, (9, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 6, 1)>

Therefore, there are a total of [10] 3-star graphs in the given graph.
