Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 11) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (12, 13) (12, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. The nodes with 3 connections would be considered as the center node of a 3-star. Let's list them:

<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<9, (3, 7, 11)>
<4, (2, 7, 14)>
<7, (6, 10, 13)>
<8, (0, 6, 13)>
<13, (2, 7, 10)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (8, 10, 12)>
<14, (4, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, -)>
<10, (0, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 13, -)>
<12, (0, 13, -)>

There is a total of 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [13].
