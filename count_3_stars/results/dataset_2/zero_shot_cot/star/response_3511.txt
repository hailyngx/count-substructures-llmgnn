Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 17) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 3) (12, 18) (12, 0) (3, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:
1. <1, (9, 4, 2)>
2. <2, (8, 18, 1)>
3. <3, (13, 16, 14)>
4. <4, (9, 1, 5)>
5. <5, (6, 13, 19)>
6. <6, (9, 5, 19)>
7. <7, (0, 17, 11)>
8. <8, (2, 16, 14)>
9. <9, (6, 4, 1)>
10. <10, (17, 16, 11)>
11. <11, (17, 19, 14)>
12. <12, (18, 0, 3)>
13. <13, (5, 3, 16)>
14. <14, (8, 11, 3)>
15. <15, (1, 19, 14)>
16. <16, (8, 10, 3)>
17. <17, (9, 7, 11)>
18. <18, (2, 12, 0)>
19. <19, (5, 15, 11)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final count is [19].
