Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 9) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 13) (6, 18) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (19, 14) (19, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 6) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 10) (9, 7) (9, 17) 

Response:
First, we need to identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

Let's start by noting down all the nodes with their degrees:
Node 0: degree 3
Node 1: degree 3
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 2
Node 4: degree 6
Node 5: degree 4
Node 6: degree 3
Node 7: degree 5
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 3
Node 10: degree 2
Node 11: degree 4
Node 12: degree 3
Node 13: degree 5
Node 14: degree 4
Node 15: degree 1
Node 16: degree 3
Node 17: degree 3
Node 18: degree 5
Node 19: degree 3

A 3-star requires the center node to be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's list down the 3-stars we can find:

<4, (7, 12, 13)>
<5, (4, 13, 18)>
<7, (4, 9, 13)>
<9, (7, 9, 17)>
<12, (3, 4, 2)>
<13, (4, 7, 14)>
<14, (13, 17, 19)>
<18, (2, 5, 19)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find 8 in total.
So, the final answer is [8].
