Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (16, 15) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (10, 4) (10, 18) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 9) (19, 3) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 1) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 18) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 6) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 15) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 19) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph and generate the unique representations, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the central nodes of the 3-stars.
2. For each central node, identify the nodes it is connected to. These connected nodes will be the leaves of the 3-stars.
3. Count the number of unique 3-stars formed by the central node and its leaves.

Let's start:

1. Nodes connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1
- Node 5
- Node 6
- Node 8
- Node 15
- Node 16
- Node 17

2. Form the unique 3-stars:
- For Node 1: <1, (2, 7, 11)> and <1, (3, 5, 11)>
- For Node 5: <5, (0, 11, 14)> and <5, (0, 14, 11)>
- For Node 6: <6, (2, 8, 15)>
- For Node 8: <8, (2, 6, 13)>
- For Node 15: <15, (6, 16, 19)>
- For Node 16: <16, (15, 19, 3)>
- For Node 17: <17, (3, 7, 14)>

3. Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [7]

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
