Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Given the edges provided, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<5, (9, 6, 2)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<7, (4, 6, 2)>
<8, (5, 7, 8)>
<9, (5, 9, 4)>
<0, (4, 6, 3)>
<1, (6, 0, 2)>
<2, (5, 9, 7)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
