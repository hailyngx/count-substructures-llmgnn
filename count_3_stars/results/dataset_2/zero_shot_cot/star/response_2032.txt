Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 9) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 3) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) 

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph by looking for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the 3-stars we find:
<5, (9, 2, 12)>
<9, (5, 8, 4)>
<10, (11, 6, 7)>
<11, (10, 3, 8)>
<7, (5, 10, 12)>
<12, (5, 9, 7)>
<0, (9, 14, 1)>
<14, (10, 7, 0)>
<13, (9, 0, 0)>
<3, (11, 12, 4)>
<8, (9, 11, 7)>
<4, (9, 12, 3)>
<1, (0, 14, 8)>
<6, (10, 11, 1)>
<2, (5, 11, 1)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we have found a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
