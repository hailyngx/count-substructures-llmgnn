Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 6) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can observe that a 3-star pattern consists of a center node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the 3-star patterns in the graph:

1. <5, (9, 6, 2)>
2. <9, (5, 8, 2)>
3. <4, (3, 14, 1)>
4. <7, (11, 6, 10)>
5. <1, (4, 7, 3)>
6. <3, (4, 1, 10)>
7. <8, (9, 7, 13)>
8. <13, (9, 6, 8)>
9. <6, (5, 7, 3)>
10. <0, (1, 12, 2)>
11. <12, (6, 0, 2)>
12. <2, (5, 9, 0)>
13. <11, (5, 9, 7)>
14. <10, (5, 7, 3)>
15. <14, (5, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].
