Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<5, (9, 2, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 1)>
<6, (9, 3, 4)>
<1, (9, 2, 0)>
<3, (9, 6, 0)>
<4, (5, 6, 3)>
<8, (5, 1, 4)>
<0, (5, 1, 3)>
<2, (5, 1, 7)>
<7, (5, 1, 2)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in total in the given graph.
