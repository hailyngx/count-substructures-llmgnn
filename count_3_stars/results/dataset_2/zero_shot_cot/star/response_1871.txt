The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 20) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 29) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 28) (3, 0) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 25) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 15) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 28) (12, 29) (19, 29) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 13) (26, 20) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 8) (20, 9) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 28) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 29) (28, 3) (28, 12) (28, 20) (28, 16) (28, 23) (5, 23) (5, 27) (29, 1) (29, 12) (29, 19) (29, 16) (29, 21) (0, 3) (0, 22) (23, 9) (23, 17) (23, 28) (23, 5) (11, 13) (11, 15) (15, 7) (15, 13) (15, 11) (15, 24) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 21) (21, 29) (21, 4) (21, 22) (27, 5) (27, 8) (24, 19) (24, 15) (24, 10) (10, 24) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 8) (8, 17) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 22) (22, 0) (22, 21) (22, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify all 3-stars in the given graph.

We start by listing the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 22.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 12, and 29.
- Node 2 is connected to node 18.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 28.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 9, 13, 21.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 23, 27.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7, 12.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 12, 15.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 17, 22, 25, 27.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 16, 20, 23.
- Node 10 is connected to node 24.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 13, 15.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 28, 29.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 11, 15, 26.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 7, 11, 13, 24.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 9, 28, 29.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 8, 20, 23.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 2, 25.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 24, 25, 29.
- Node 20 is connected to nodes 9, 17, 26, 28.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 4, 22, 29.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 21.
- Node 23 is connected to nodes 5, 9, 17, 28.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 10, 15, 19.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 8, 18, 19.
- Node 26 is connected to nodes 13, 20.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 5, 8.
- Node 28 is connected to nodes 3, 12, 16, 20, 23.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 1, 12, 16, 19, 21.

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

<3, (1, 28, 12)>
<4, (1, 21, 29)>
<7, (6, 12, 15)>
<9, (4, 16, 20)>
<13, (4, 11, 15)>
<15, (7, 11, 13)>
<16, (9, 28, 29)>
<17, (8, 20, 23)>
<18, (2, 18, 25)>
<19, (19, 24, 25)>
<20, (9, 17, 26)>
<21, (4, 21, 29)>
<22, (0, 8, 22)>
<23, (5, 17, 28)>
<24, (15, 19, 24)>
<25, (18, 19, 25)>
<26, (13, 20, 26)>
<27, (8, 25, 27)>
<28, (3, 12, 28)>
<29, (19, 21, 29)>
