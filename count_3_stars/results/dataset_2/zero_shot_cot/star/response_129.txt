Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify nodes that act as the center in a 3-star configuration.

1. Node 5 can form 3-stars with the leaf nodes (1, 4, 8). (5, 1, 4, 8)
2. Node 9 can form 3-stars with the leaf nodes (2, 4, 7). (9, 2, 4, 7)
3. Node 4 can form 3-stars with the leaf nodes (1, 5, 7). (4, 1, 5, 7)
4. Node 7 can form 3-stars with the leaf nodes (1, 4, 8). (7, 1, 4, 8)
5. Node 1 can form 3-stars with the leaf nodes (4, 5, 7). (1, 4, 5, 7)
6. Node 8 doesn't form any 3-stars since it has 5 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5] when considering unique configurations. 

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
