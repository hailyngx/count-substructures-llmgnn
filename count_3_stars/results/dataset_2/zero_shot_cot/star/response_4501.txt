Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three edges connected to them:
- Node 0 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 1 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 2 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 3 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 4 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 6 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 7 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 8 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 10 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 11 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 12 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 13 has 3 edges connected (potential center of a 3-star).
- Node 14 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 15 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 16 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 17 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 18 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 20 has 2 edges connected.
- Node 21 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 22 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 23 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 24 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 25 has 5 edges connected.
- Node 26 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 27 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 28 has 4 edges connected.
- Node 29 has 4 edges connected.

2. Potential 3-stars with center at node 13:
- <13, (24, 27, 11)>

3. Potential 3-stars with center at node 14:
- <14, (22, 17, 3)>
- <14, (22, 17, 9)>
- <14, (22, 17, 6)>
- <14, (22, 17, 8)>
- <14, (22, 9, 5)>

4. Potential 3-stars with center at node 15:
- <15, (23, 26, 0)>

5. Potential 3-stars with center at node 21:
- <21, (1, 2, 5)>
- <21, (1, 2, 15)>

6. Potential 3-stars with center at node 22:
- <22, (14, 17, 3)>
- <22, (14, 17, 9)>
- <22, (14, 25, 4)>
- <22, (14, 25, 7)>

7. Potential 3-stars with center at node 24:
- <24, (13, 9, 12)>
- <24, (13, 9, 28)>

8. Potential 3-stars with center at node 25:
- <25, (5, 22, 4)>
- <25, (5, 22, 7)>
- <25, (5, 25, 4)>
- <25, (5, 25, 7)>

9. Counting the total number of 3-stars:

Total = [12]
