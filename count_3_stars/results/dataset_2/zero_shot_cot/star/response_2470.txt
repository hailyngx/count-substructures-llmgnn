Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 19) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 18) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 2) (18, 1) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Counting the number of 3-stars:
- Start with the node count (20 nodes).
- As each 3-star has a center node and three leaves, one 3-star requires 4 nodes in total.
- Therefore, the maximum number of 3-stars possible in this graph is ⌊20 / 4⌋ = 5.

Let's now identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (0, 10, 17)>
<1, (14, 18, -)>
<13, (2, 18, 19)>
<10, (6, 11, -)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
