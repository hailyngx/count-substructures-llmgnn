Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 1) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (1, 8) (1, 12) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 10) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we can look for nodes with exactly three edges connected to them. Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

<0, (2, 9, 11)>
<1, (8, 12, 14)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 6, 11)>
<4, (7, 8, 13)>
<5, (3, 7, 10)>
<6, (3, 7, 10)>
<7, (4, 5, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 11)>
<9, (0, 13, 9)>
<10, (0, 5, 6)>
<11, (3, 8, 0)>
<12, (1, 14, 4)>
<13, (4, 9, 7)>
<14, (1, 8, 12)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
