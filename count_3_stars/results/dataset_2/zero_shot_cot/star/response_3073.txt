Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are directly connected to each node:
- Node 0: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 8}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 5: {2, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 1, 3, 4}
- Node 7: {5, 8}
- Node 8: {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {1, 3, 5, 8}

Next, let's identify the 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>

So, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [10]
