Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 15) (17, 1) (17, 6) (4, 18) (4, 14) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 13) (1, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 11) (19, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 17) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 9) (16, 3) (16, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (9, 14) (9, 2) (5, 15) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Given the provided edges, the 3-stars in this graph are as follows:

<0, (7, 8, 15)>
<1, (13, 17, 19)>
<3, (11, 14, 16)>
<4, (14, 18, 12)>
<6, (8, 16, 17)>
<8, (6, 7, 12)>
<9, (2, 9, 14)>
<13, (1, 2, 19)>
<15, (0, 10, 5)>
<16, (6, 3, 16)>
<17, (1, 6, 17)>
<18, (4, 11, 15)>
<19, (1, 3, 11)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
