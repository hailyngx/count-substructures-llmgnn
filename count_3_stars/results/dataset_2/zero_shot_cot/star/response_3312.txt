Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 8) (11, 12) (16, 21) (16, 25) (16, 5) (20, 25) (20, 26) (20, 1) (20, 8) (25, 16) (25, 20) (25, 5) (25, 19) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 6) (8, 11) (8, 20) (4, 13) (4, 24) (4, 1) (28, 11) (28, 9) (28, 13) (29, 5) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 21) (12, 11) (12, 17) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 1) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 1) (0, 18) (2, 22) (2, 12) (2, 6) (19, 25) (19, 22) (19, 15) (21, 16) (21, 17) (21, 13) (21, 15) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 3) (15, 19) (15, 21) (15, 26) (13, 4) (13, 28) (13, 21) (13, 3) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 24) (14, 10) (26, 20) (26, 15) (26, 6) (6, 23) (6, 2) (6, 26) (1, 20) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 27) (1, 18) (10, 3) (10, 14) (24, 4) (24, 14) (24, 5) (5, 16) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 24) 

Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <1, (20, 22, 27)>
2. <5, (16, 19, 25)>
3. <6, (2, 22, 26)>
4. <12, (11, 17, 27)>
5. <13, (4, 21, 28)>
6. <15, (19, 21, 26)>
7. <16, (5, 20, 25)>
8. <21, (16, 17, 21)>
9. <24, (4, 14, 24)>

There are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
