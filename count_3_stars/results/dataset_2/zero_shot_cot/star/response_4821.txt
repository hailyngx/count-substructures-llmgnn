Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 6) 

Response:
Let's first identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, as these nodes can be considered as potential centers of 3-stars.

The nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are: 0, 2, 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 14.

Now, for each of these potential centers, let's find the connected nodes to form the 3-stars.

For node 0:
- (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 11), (0, 13)
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 11)>
<0, (1, 6, 13)>
<0, (4, 6, 13)>
<0, (6, 11, 13)>

For node 2:
- (2, 6), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 14)
<2, (6, 10, 12)>
<2, (6, 10, 14)>
<2, (6, 12, 14)>
<2, (10, 12, 14)>

For node 4:
- (4, 0), (4, 9), (4, 11)
<4, (0, 9, 11)>

For node 7:
- (7, 3), (7, 8), (7, 9)
<7, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- (8, 3), (8, 7), (8, 10)
<8, (3, 7, 10)>

For node 12:
- (12, 2), (12, 6), (12, 9)
<12, (2, 6, 9)>

For node 13:
- (13, 0), (13, 6), (13, 8)
<13, (0, 6, 8)>

For node 14:
- (14, 1), (14, 2), (14, 10)
<14, (1, 2, 10)>

The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [12].
