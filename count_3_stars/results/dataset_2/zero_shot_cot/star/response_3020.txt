Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 6: (1, 3, 4)
2. Node 9: (2, 7, 6)
3. Node 4: (0, 3, 6)
4. Node 7: (8, 5, 9)
5. Node 5: (3, 7, 8)
6. Node 2: (1, 3, 9)
7. Node 8: (1, 3, 7)
8. Node 0: (1, 4, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8]. 

<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 7, 6)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<7, (8, 5, 9)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
