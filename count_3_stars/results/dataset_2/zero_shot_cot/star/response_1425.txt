Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the centers of the 3-stars (nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes). Based on the given edges, nodes with 3 connections are 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Next, we can list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
