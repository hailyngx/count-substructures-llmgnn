Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5, node 9, and node 4. These nodes are the leaves of the potential 3-stars.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 6, 8, 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 6, and 3.

From the information given, we can identify the following 3-stars:
1. <5, (9, 8, 1)>
2. <5, (9, 8, 3)>
3. <5, (9, 8, 7)>
4. <5, (9, 8, 5)>
5. <5, (9, 4, 7)>
6. <5, (9, 4, 6)>
7. <9, (5, 8, 3)>
8. <9, (5, 8, 1)>
9. <9, (5, 8, 7)>
10. <9, (5, 8, 5)>
11. <9, (4, 7, 5)>
12. <9, (4, 7, 2)>
13. <9, (4, 7, 9)>
14. <9, (4, 7, 4)>

Now we need to count how many unique 3-stars we have found.
