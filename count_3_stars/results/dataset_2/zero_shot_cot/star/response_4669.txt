Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
First, let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's find all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Central node 0: (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8) --> <0, (5, 7, 8)>
2. Central node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 8) --> <1, (2, 3, 8)>
3. Central node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5) --> <2, (1, 3, 5)>
4. Central node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4) --> <3, (1, 2, 4)>
5. Central node 4: (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6) --> <4, (3, 5, 6)>
6. Central node 5: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 6) --> <5, (0, 2, 6)>
7. Central node 6: (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 7) --> <6, (0, 4, 7)>
8. Central node 7: (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 4) --> <7, (0, 2, 4)>
9. Central node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 3) --> <8, (0, 1, 3)>
10. Central node 9: (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 0) --> <9, (3, 7, 0)>

Now, we have found all the 3-stars in the graph. The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
