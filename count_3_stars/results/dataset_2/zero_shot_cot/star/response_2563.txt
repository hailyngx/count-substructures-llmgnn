Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 4) (1, 12) (21, 1) (21, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 9) (27, 2) (27, 19) (27, 13) (2, 27) (2, 8) (29, 17) (29, 9) (29, 16) (29, 13) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 28) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 20) (4, 1) (4, 28) (18, 10) (8, 2) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 7) (28, 6) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 25) (9, 0) (9, 29) (9, 22) (9, 12) (22, 9) (22, 10) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 5) (13, 16) (19, 27) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 23) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 3) (17, 29) (17, 8) (17, 23) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 7) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 22) (10, 15) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 10) (15, 14) (3, 5) (3, 26) (7, 8) (7, 24) (16, 29) (16, 13) (16, 23) (11, 0) (11, 24) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 28) (23, 19) (23, 17) (23, 16) (23, 20) (14, 5) (14, 15) (20, 6) (20, 23) 

Response:
Let's find 3-stars in the given graph. 

We need to identify nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern.

Looking at the edges, we can see the following 3-stars:
- <0, (9, 11, 15)>
- <1, (4, 12, 21)>
- <2, (8, 13, 27)>
- <3, (5, 14, 26)>
- <6, (12, 15, 28)>
- <7 (8, 24, 25)>
- <10, (15, 18, 21)>
- <13, (5, 16, 27)>
- <16, (13, 23, 29)>
- <17, (8, 23, 29)>
- <19, (26, 27, 28)>
- <20, (6, 23, 28)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of [12].
