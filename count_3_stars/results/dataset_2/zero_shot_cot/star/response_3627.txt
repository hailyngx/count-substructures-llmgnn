Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Node 5: (5, 9, 4) -> <5, (9, 4, 5)>
2. Node 9: (9, 6, 5) -> <9, (6, 5, 9)>
3. Node 6: (6, 1, 9) -> <6, (1, 9, 6)>
4. Node 1: (1, 3, 6) -> <1, (3, 6, 1)>
5. Node 3: (3, 0, 6) -> <3, (0, 6, 3)>
6. Node 4: (4, 1, 5) -> <4, (1, 5, 4)>
7. Node 7: (7, 4, 9) -> <7, (4, 9, 7)>
8. Node 8: (8, 6, 5) -> <8, (6, 5, 8)>
9. Node 2: (2, 7, 5) -> <2, (7, 5, 2)>
10. Node 0: (0, 4, 6) -> <0, (4, 6, 0)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
