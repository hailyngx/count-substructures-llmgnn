Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 17) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 1) (4, 19) (4, 26) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 28) (0, 14) (0, 25) (0, 23) (27, 21) (27, 9) (27, 5) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 26) (23, 29) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 18) (6, 26) (9, 27) (9, 6) (9, 29) (8, 2) (15, 25) (15, 16) (20, 3) (20, 24) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 12) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 1) (18, 6) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 21) (3, 20) (3, 11) (3, 21) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 17) (14, 0) (14, 5) (5, 27) (5, 11) (5, 14) (5, 19) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 16) (21, 27) (21, 18) (21, 3) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 9) (29, 25) (12, 2) (12, 17) (26, 4) (26, 23) (26, 6) (26, 10) (10, 26) (10, 16) (16, 15) (16, 19) (16, 10) (24, 7) (24, 20) (24, 18) (25, 0) (25, 15) (25, 19) (25, 29) (1, 22) (1, 28) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node by exactly three edges. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-stars.

From the given edges:
- The node 22 is connected to 4 nodes (13, 23, 29, 1).
- The node 7 is connected to 3 nodes (11, 24, 28).
- The node 0 is connected to 3 nodes (14, 23, 25).
- The node 27 is connected to 3 nodes (21, 9, 5).
- The node 6 is connected to 4 nodes (9, 28, 18, 26).
- The node 11 is connected to 4 nodes (7, 3, 5, 17).
- The node 18 is connected to 4 nodes (6, 2, 24, 21).
- The node 3 is connected to 3 nodes (20, 11, 21).
- The node 5 is connected to 4 nodes (27, 11, 14, 19).
- The node 19 is connected to 4 nodes (4, 5, 25, 16).
- The node 21 is connected to 3 nodes (27, 18, 3).
- The node 17 is connected to 3 nodes (13, 11, 12).
- The node 29 is connected to 4 nodes (22, 23, 9, 25).
- The node 26 is connected to 4 nodes (4, 23, 6, 10).
- The node 16 is connected to 3 nodes (15, 19, 10).
- The node 24 is connected to 3 nodes (7, 20, 18).
- The node 25 is connected to 4 nodes (0, 19, 15, 29).
- The node 1 is connected to 2 nodes (22, 28).
- The node 12 is connected to 2 nodes (2, 17).
- The node 10 is connected to 2 nodes (26, 16).
- The node 15 is connected to 2 nodes (25, 16).

Based on the connections, we can identify the 3-stars in the graph. Now let's count them:

Total number of 3-stars: [8]
Unique 3-stars:
<22, (13, 23, 29)>
<7, (11, 24, 28)>
<0, (14, 23, 25)>
<27, (21, 9, 5)>
<6, (9, 28, 18)>
<11, (7, 3, 5)>
<5, (27, 14, 19)>
<19, (4, 25, 16)>
