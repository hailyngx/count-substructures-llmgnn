Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 17) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (10, 0) (10, 12) (17, 8) (17, 19) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 16) (18, 5) (18, 11) (11, 18) (11, 2) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 2) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (6, 14) (2, 11) (2, 15) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 16) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 14) (19, 16) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 15) 

Response:
There are 6 unique 3-stars in this graph.

<[3, (1, 5, 6)]>
<[7, (8, 13, 12)]>
<[0, (10, 14, 16)]>
<[1, (3, 6, 9)]>
<[8, (7, 13, 17)]>
<[12, (4, 7, 19)]>

Therefore the number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
