Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 12) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 6) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, since they could potentially be the centers of 3-stars:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 12, 11, and 6
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 13
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 13, and 6
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 7, 10, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 10, and 8
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 14
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8, 13, and 0
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 9, and 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 10, 6, and 0

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
- There are <4, (12, 11, 6)> (1 3-star)
- There are <10, (11, 6, 13)> (1 3-star)
- There are <11, (4, 10, 8)> (1 3-star)
- There are <8, (11, 13, 6)> (1 3-star)
- There are <13, (7, 10, 8)> (1 3-star)
- There are <6, (4, 10, 8)> (1 3-star)
- There are <12, (4, 0, 14)> (1 3-star)
- There are <1, (8, 13, 0)> (1 3-star)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
