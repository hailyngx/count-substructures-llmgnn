Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the central node.

For node 0:
- Connected to node 4 and node 8. Not a 3-star since it has 2 neighbors.

For node 1:
- Connected to node 4, node 6, node 8, node 9, and node 10. Not a 3-star since it has 4 neighbors.

For node 2:
- Connected to node 5, node 11, node 12, and node 14. Not a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.

For node 3:
- Connected to node 0, node 8, node 11, and node 14. Not a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.

For node 4:
- Connected to node 0, node 1, node 7, and node 14. This forms a 3-star: <4, (0, 1, 7)>.

For node 5:
- Connected to node 2, node 6, node 10, and node 13. Not a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.

For node 6:
- Connected to node 1, node 5, node 10, and node 12. This forms a 3-star: <6, (1, 5, 10)>.

For node 7:
- Connected to node 4 and node 8. Not a 3-star since it has 2 neighbors.

For node 8:
- Connected to node 0, node 1, node 3, and node 13. This forms a 3-star: <8, (0, 1, 3)>.

For node 9:
- Connected to node 1, node 10, node 11, and node 12. Not a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.

For node 10:
- Connected to node 1, node 5, node 6, and node 9. Not a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.

For node 11:
- Connected to node 2, node 3, node 9, and node 13. Not a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.

For node 12:
- Connected to node 6, node 7, node 9, and node 2. Not a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.

For node 13:
- Connected to node 5, node 8, node 11, and node 9. Not a 3-star since it has 3 neighbors.

For node 14:
- Connected to node 2, node 3, and node 4. Not a 3-star since it has 2 neighbors.

The unique 3-stars found are: <4, (0, 1, 7)> and <6, (1, 5, 10)> and <8, (0, 1, 3)>.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
