Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 20) (1, 14) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 12) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 13) (11, 13) (11, 20) (28, 9) (28, 18) (28, 17) (28, 24) (5, 21) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 29) (13, 6) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 24) (25, 7) (25, 15) (15, 25) (15, 16) (15, 23) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 0) (10, 19) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (24, 28) (24, 7) (24, 19) (19, 10) (19, 24) (19, 22) (19, 2) (22, 19) (22, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 17) (17, 28) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 27) (2, 19) (2, 27) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 29) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 27) (23, 18) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 20) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 18) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 11) (20, 23) (20, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 20) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify all the 3-stars present in the graph.

We can see that a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three leaves. Let's list all the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<8, (14, 0, 16)>
<13, (18, 11, 6)>
<16, (21, 8, 15)>
<18, (28, 14, 23)>
<19, (24, 10, 2)>
<20, (12, 21, 26)>
<21, (16, 5, 20)>
<22, (19, 3, 2)>
<23, (15, 17, 18)>
<24, (19, 7, 28)>
<27, (2, 29, 17)>
<28, (18, 24, 9)>
<29, (16, 27, 13)>

There are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].
