Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (17, 13) (7, 3) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 19) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 19) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that form 3-stars.

1. Identify nodes connected to exactly 3 other nodes:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 16, 10, and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 16, and 6.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 13, 11, and 6.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 17, 12, and 10.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 19.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 9, 5, and 6.

2. Count the number of unique 3-stars:
- <2, (16, 10, 4)>
- <4, (2, 16, 6)>
- <12, (13, 11, 6)>
- <13, (17, 12, 10)>
- <16, (2, 4, 19)>
- <18, (9, 5, 6)>

[Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 6.]
