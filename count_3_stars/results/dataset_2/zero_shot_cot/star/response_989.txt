Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 12) (14, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 0) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 12) (0, 13) (0, 19) (10, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the center nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Center node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 13
- Center node 7 is connected to nodes 11, 12, and 15
- Center node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 16, and 17
- Center node 12 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 7
- Center node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 19
- Center node 15 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 18
- Center node 16 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8
- Center node 18 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 15
- Center node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 13, and 6

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars by looking at each unique combination of center nodes and their connected nodes:

- <3, (2, 5, 13)>
- <7, (11, 12, 15)>
- <8, (1, 16, 17)>
- <12, (1, 4, 7)>
- <13, (0, 3, 19)>
- <15, (5, 7, 18)>
- <16, (1, 3, 8)>
- <18, (6, 9, 15)>
- <19, (0, 13, 6)>

Thus, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
