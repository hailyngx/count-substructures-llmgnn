Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
First, let's find all 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 5 can form a 3-star with nodes 6, 1, and 4.
2. Node 9 can form a 3-star with nodes 6, 4, and 1.
3. Node 4 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 7.
4. Node 7 can form a 3-star with nodes 9, 4, and 6.
5. Node 1 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 3.
6. Node 3 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 1, and 0.
7. Node 6 can form a 3-star with nodes 5, 9, and 7.
8. Node 8 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 7, and 1.
9. Node 0 can form a 3-star with nodes 4, 3, and 2.
10. Node 2 can form a 3-star with nodes 3, 0, and 2.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is 10.
