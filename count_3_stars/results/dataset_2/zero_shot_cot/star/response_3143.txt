Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 19) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (13, 17) (13, 18) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 16) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 8) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 1) 

Response:
The key to finding 3-stars in a graph is to look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<16, (11, 12, 10)>
<6, (9, 4, 0)>
<9, (6, 10, 1)>
<14, (3, 19, 2)>
<17, (13, 19, 18)>
<10, (16, 9, 7)>
<2, (14, 12, 15)>
<18, (19, 5, 13)>
<13, (17, 18, 0)>
<4, (16, 6, 15)>
<12, (16, 2, 15)>
<19, (14, 17, 18)>
<7, (10, 3, 5)>
<3, (14, 18, 7)>
<15, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (6, 9, 5)>
<5, (18, 7, 0)>
<1, (9, 10, 8)>
<8, (3, 15, 1)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [19].
