Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Based on the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars in the graph:
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (3, 4, 1)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (9, 1, 0)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 3, 2)>
<0, (3, 8, 7)>
<7, (5, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<4, (5, 9, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
