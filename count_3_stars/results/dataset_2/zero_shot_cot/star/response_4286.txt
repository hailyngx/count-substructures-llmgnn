Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 10)>
<8, (4, 9, 10)>
<13, (6, 9, 11)>
<4, (1, 8, 5)>
<7, (1, 0, 10)>
<12, (8, 11, 14)>
<0, (4, 7, 14)>
<14, (0, 12, 13)>
<9, (1, 8, 13)>
<6, (3, 13, 2)>
<2, (3, 9, 6)>
<10, (3, 8, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 11)>
<11, (13, 4, 6)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [15]
