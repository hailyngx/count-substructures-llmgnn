Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, let's first identify them:

1. <5, (9, 6, 2)>
2. <9, (5, 4, 3)>
3. <4, (9, 2, 3)>
4. <7, (9, 0, 1)>
5. <6, (5, 3, 2)>
6. <0, (7, 6, 8)>
7. <3, (9, 4, 6)>
8. <2, (5, 4, 6)>
9. <8, (5, 7, 0)>
10. <1, (5, 9, 7)>

So, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
