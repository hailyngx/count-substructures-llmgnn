Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 18) (22, 4) (22, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (3, 22) (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 25) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 19) (21, 1) (21, 6) (21, 11) (21, 25) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 2) (6, 16) (26, 1) (26, 14) (4, 22) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 23) (4, 0) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 20) (17, 1) (17, 8) (17, 11) (20, 18) (14, 26) (14, 24) (14, 25) (12, 4) (12, 28) (2, 6) (2, 11) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 6) (16, 24) (16, 8) (24, 14) (24, 16) (24, 27) (24, 29) (7, 9) (7, 29) (7, 10) (29, 24) (29, 7) (29, 0) (29, 25) (23, 4) (23, 28) (23, 27) (28, 12) (28, 23) (27, 24) (27, 23) (27, 8) (10, 5) (10, 7) (19, 1) (25, 15) (25, 21) (25, 14) (25, 29) (0, 4) (0, 29) (11, 5) (11, 21) (11, 17) (11, 2) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 16) (8, 27) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph step by step to count the number of 3-stars:

1. Start with each node and count the number of adjacent nodes it has (i.e., its degree):
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 2
- Node 3: 3
- Node 4: 5
- Node 5: 5
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 2
- Node 10: 2
- Node 11: 5
- Node 12: 2
- Node 13: 1
- Node 14: 3
- Node 15: 3
- Node 16: 5
- Node 17: 3
- Node 18: 4
- Node 19: 1
- Node 20: 1
- Node 21: 4
- Node 22: 3
- Node 23: 3
- Node 24: 4
- Node 25: 4
- Node 26: 2
- Node 27: 3
- Node 28: 2
- Node 29: 4

2. Find all 3-stars in the graph:
- Total 3-stars: [6]
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (6, 16, 21)>, <16, (5, 6, 24)>, <21, (1, 5, 25)>, <4, (18, 22, 23)>, <1, (17, 19, 21)>, <24, (14, 16, 29)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6].
