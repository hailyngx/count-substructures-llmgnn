Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:
1. <1, (2, 4, 8)>
2. <3, (9, 11, 12)>
3. <4, (1, 11, 13)>
4. <5, (0, 6, 14)>
5. <6, (1, 5, 14)>
6. <7, (6, 8, 14)>
7. <8, (1, 7, 12)>
8. <9, (2, 3, 11)>
9. <10, (1, 5, 11)>
10. <11, (3, 4, 10)>
11. <12, (8, 9, 14)>
12. <14, (0, 5, 12)>

So, there are [12] 3-stars in the given graph.
