Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
Let's start by identifying the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 8, and 6: <5, (9, 8, 6)>
2. Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 3: <9, (5, 8, 3)>
3. Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 7, and 6: <8, (9, 7, 6)>
4. Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 2: <6, (5, 8, 2)>
5. Node 0 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 6, and 7: <0, (9, 6, 7)>
6. Node 7 forms a 3-star with nodes 8, 0, and 3: <7, (8, 0, 3)>
7. Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 2: <1, (5, 7, 2)>
8. Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes 9, 0, and 7: <3, (9, 0, 7)>
9. Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 6, and 0: <2, (4, 6, 0)>

There are a total of 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Hence, the count of 3-stars is [9].
