Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 10) (27, 3) (27, 5) (7, 21) (7, 22) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 22) (18, 27) (18, 22) (18, 14) (22, 7) (22, 21) (22, 18) (22, 0) (0, 22) (0, 24) (20, 29) (20, 5) (20, 11) (28, 21) (28, 4) (1, 16) (1, 13) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 11) (29, 20) (29, 6) (29, 26) (29, 25) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 4) (4, 28) (4, 13) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 3) (23, 26) (23, 24) (26, 29) (26, 23) (8, 15) (8, 16) (9, 2) (9, 11) (6, 17) (6, 29) (6, 25) (6, 3) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 24) (24, 0) (24, 23) (24, 16) (24, 2) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 9) (11, 19) (19, 11) (19, 2) (3, 27) (3, 12) (3, 6) (14, 18) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 24) (2, 19) (2, 14) (2, 25) (5, 27) (5, 20) (5, 12) (25, 29) (25, 6) (25, 2) (25, 10) (10, 27) (10, 25) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges. These nodes can potentially be centers of 3-stars.
- Node 15 has 3 edges: (15, 27), (15, 8), (15, 12)
- Node 27 has 4 edges
- Node 7 has 2 edges
- Node 21 has 3 edges
- Node 22 has 4 edges
- Node 0 has 3 edges
- Node 20 has 3 edges
- Node 28 has 2 edges
- Node 1 has 2 edges
- Node 17 has 3 edges
- Node 29 has 4 edges

Now, let's construct the 3-stars:
<15, (27, 8, 12)>
<27, (15, 18, 10)>
<21, (7, 28, 22)>
<22, (7, 21, 18)>
<0, (22, 24, 15)>
<20, (29, 5, 11)>
<17, (13, 6, 11)>
<29, (20, 6, 26)>

Counting the unique 3-stars found, we get a total of [8].
