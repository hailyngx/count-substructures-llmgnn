Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 6) (27, 12) (27, 3) (27, 28) (27, 7) (7, 12) (7, 27) (7, 6) (7, 13) (0, 22) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 8) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 3) (20, 5) (16, 28) (16, 24) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 26) (28, 27) (28, 16) (28, 1) (28, 4) (28, 15) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 22) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 4) (29, 9) (29, 11) (29, 18) (10, 14) (10, 22) (15, 28) (15, 18) (22, 0) (22, 8) (22, 10) (22, 19) (18, 29) (18, 15) (19, 22) (19, 11) (25, 9) (25, 6) (11, 29) (11, 19) (11, 24) (11, 26) (24, 16) (24, 11) (6, 12) (6, 7) (6, 25) (6, 26) (5, 20) (5, 23) (5, 21) (23, 14) (23, 5) (26, 16) (26, 11) (26, 6) (26, 21) (3, 27) (3, 20) (3, 4) (4, 28) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (1, 16) (1, 28) (1, 13) (13, 7) (13, 16) (13, 4) (13, 1) (21, 5) (21, 26) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

- The center node must be connected to exactly three other nodes to form a 3-star.
- Since the graph has 30 nodes, we need to check each node to see if it is part of a 3-star.

Observing the given edges, we identify the following 3-stars:
<12, (27, 7, 6)>
<27, (12, 3, 28)>
<7, (12, 27, 6)>
<28, (27, 16, 1)>
<9, (8, 29, 25)>
<29, (9, 18, 11)>
<11, (29, 24, 19)>
<6, (12, 7, 25)>
<5, (20, 23, 21)>
<21, (5, 26, 21)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
