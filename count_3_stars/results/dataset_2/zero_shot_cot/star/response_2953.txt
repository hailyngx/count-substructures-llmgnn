Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars:

1. Identify all nodes with degree 3, as they could potentially serve as the center of a 3-star. Nodes 2, 4, and 9 have degree 3 in this graph.
2. For each node with degree 3, check if it forms a 3-star with its three neighbors. 
3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars by counting the valid 3-stars.

Let's go through the steps:

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 9, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Potential 3-stars: <2, (9, 1, 3)>, <2, (9, 1, 4)>, <2, (9, 3, 4)>
  Only <2, (9, 1, 3)> is a valid 3-star.

For node 4:
- Neighbors: 5, 3, 1, 9, 2
- Potential 3-stars: <4, (5, 3, 1)>, <4, (5, 9, 2)>, <4, (3, 1, 9)>, <4, (3, 1, 2)>
  Only <4, (3, 1, 9)> is a valid 3-star.

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 8, 4, 2, 3, 7
- Potential 3-stars: <9, (8, 4, 2)>, <9, (4, 3, 1)>, <9, (3, 2, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>
  None of the potential 3-stars are valid.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2] and they are <2, (9, 1, 3)> and <4, (3, 1, 9)>.
