Response:
We will identify the 3-stars in the given graph.

1. Node 0 is connected to nodes 27, 4, 29. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 0. <0, (27, 4, 29)>
2. Node 27 is connected to nodes 0, 25, 3, and 8. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 27. <27, (0, 25, 3)>
3. Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 2. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 6. <6, (1, 3, 2)>
4. Node 9 is connected to nodes 29, 19, forming a 3-star with the center at node 9. <9, (29, 19)>
5. Node 17 is connected to nodes 10, 23, 15. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 17. <17, (10, 23, 15)>
6. Node 10 is connected to nodes 17, 4, and 2. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 10. <10, (17, 4, 2)>
7. Node 15 is connected to nodes 17, 7, 25, 5. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 15. <15, (17, 7, 25)>
8. Node 24 is connected to nodes 29, 21, 26, and 11. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 24. <24, (29, 21, 26)>
9. Node 19 is connected to nodes 9, 28, 21, 26, and 5. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 19. <19, (9, 28, 21)>
10. Node 26 is connected to nodes 20, 24, 19, and 18. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 26. <26, (20, 24, 19)>
11. Node 22 is connected to nodes 4, 2, and 11. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 22. <22, (4, 2, 11)>
12. Node 18 is connected to nodes 14, 26, and 7. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 18. <18, (14, 26, 7)>
13. Node 5 is connected to nodes 15, 19, and 8. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 5. <5, (15, 19, 8)>
14. Node 11 is connected to nodes 24, 22, 23, and 12. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 11. <11, (24, 22, 23)>
15. Node 25 is connected to nodes 27, 15, 23, 16, and 8. This forms a 3-star with the center at node 25. <25, (27, 15, 23)>

Therefore, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
