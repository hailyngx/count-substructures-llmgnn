Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 25) (15, 16) (27, 7) (27, 1) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 0) (9, 0) (22, 2) (23, 8) (23, 0) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 17) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 3) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 21) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 29) (14, 4) (14, 0) (13, 16) (13, 29) (13, 10) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 7) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 28) (17, 8) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 5) (20, 17) (20, 24) (20, 28) (20, 10) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 16) (28, 26) (28, 11) (28, 20) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 21) (16, 1) (10, 13) (10, 26) (10, 20) (10, 7) (10, 24) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 12) (24, 20) (24, 10) (24, 7) (24, 25) (7, 27) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 10) (7, 24) (29, 6) (29, 0) (29, 13) (19, 1) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 25) (1, 27) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 19) (25, 15) (25, 24) (25, 12) 

Response:
The center of a 3-star should have degree 3. Let's identify the nodes with degree 3, which could potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with degree 3: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21, 24, 26, 28

Let's now check each of these nodes to see if they are indeed the centers of 3-stars:

1. Node 2: (2, 22, 3, 5), (2, 22, 5, 3)
2. Node 3: (3, 2, 11, 12), (3, 2, 12, 11)
3. Node 5: (5, 8, 2, 17), (5, 8, 17, 2)
4. Node 7: (7, 27, 6, 24), (7, 27, 24, 6)
5. Node 8: (8, 23, 5, 17), (8, 23, 17, 5)
6. Node 10: (10, 13, 20, 24), (10, 13, 24, 20)
7. Node 11: (11, 3, 28, 26), (11, 3, 26, 28)
8. Node 12: (12, 17, 5, 25), (12, 17, 25, 5)
9. Node 13: (13, 16, 10, 29), (13, 16, 29, 10)
10. Node 16: (16, 15, 13, 21), (16, 15, 21, 13)
11. Node 17: (17, 8, 5, 12), (17, 8, 12, 5)
12. Node 20: (20, 17, 10, 24), (20, 17, 24, 10)
13. Node 21: (21, 4, 16, 26), (21, 4, 26, 16)
14. Node 24: (24, 20, 7, 25), (24, 20, 25, 7)
15. Node 26: (26, 28, 10, 21), (26, 28, 21, 10)
16. Node 28: (28, 26, 11, 20), (28, 26, 20, 11)
