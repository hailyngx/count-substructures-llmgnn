Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph and list them out, let's analyze the graph step by step:

Step 1: Identify the central nodes
- The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 9.
- Based on the edges given, possible central nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes are 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 7.

Step 2: Find the leaves for each central node
- For each central node, identify the three nodes it is connected to. Let's list them out:
  - Central node 0: (2, 4, 5)
  - Central node 2: (0, 1, 3)
  - Central node 4: (0, 1, 6)
  - Central node 5: (7, 8, 0)
  - Central node 8: (2, 5, 3)
  - Central node 7: (5, 4, 6)

Step 3: Count the unique 3-stars
- Now, let's list out the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
  <0, (2, 4, 5)>
  <2, (0, 1, 3)>
  <4, (0, 1, 6)>
  <5, (7, 8, 0)>
  <8, (2, 5, 3)>
  <7, (5, 4, 6)>

Finally, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].
