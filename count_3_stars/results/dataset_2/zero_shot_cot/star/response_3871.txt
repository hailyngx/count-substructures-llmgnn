Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 8) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 3) (19, 16) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 15) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 12) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 18) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 18) (0, 15) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<4, (7, 14, 16)>
<7, (4, 15, 18)>
<3, (1, 8, 12)>
<5, (2, 7, 18)>
