Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to node 5, node 9, and node 6, as they can potentially be the center of the 3-stars. 

Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 2, and 1.
Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 4, and 7.
Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 1, 3, 2, 4, and 8.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:
1. (5, 9, 6) - <5, (9, 6, 4)>
2. (9, 6, 5) - <9, (6, 5, 2)>
3. (6, 5, 9) - <6, (5, 9, 4)>
4. (1, 5, 6) - <1, (5, 6, 2)>
5. (6, 5, 1) - <6, (5, 1, 3)>
6. (1, 6, 9) - <1, (6, 9, 4)>
7. (9, 6, 1) - <9, (6, 1, 3)>
8. (9, 4, 6) - <9, (4, 6, 1)>

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the final answer is [8].
