Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star subgraphs in the given graph:
- Node 5 connects with nodes 9, 2, and 7: <5, (9, 2, 7)>
- Node 9 connects with nodes 5, 6, and 1: <9, (5, 6, 1)>
- Node 6 connects with nodes 9, 1, and 7: <6, (9, 1, 7)>
- Node 1 connects with nodes 9, 6, and 3: <1, (9, 6, 3)>
- Node 3 connects with nodes 1, 0, and 2: <3, (1, 0, 2)>
- Node 0 connects with nodes 6, 3, and 4: <0, (6, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 connects with nodes 5, 9, and 6: <7, (5, 9, 6)>
- Node 2 connects with nodes 5, 3, and 7: <2, (5, 3, 7)>
- Node 8 connects with nodes 6, 1, and 0: <8, (6, 1, 0)>
- Node 4 connects with nodes 6, 3, and 2: <4, (6, 3, 2)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [10].
