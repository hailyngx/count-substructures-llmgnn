Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<0, (5, 8, 7)>
<1, (9, 8, 7)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (6, 4, 9)>
<4, (9, 6, 2)>
<5, (9, 8, 0)>
<6, (4, 3, 2)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 9, 7)>
<9, (5, 4, 8)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [10].
