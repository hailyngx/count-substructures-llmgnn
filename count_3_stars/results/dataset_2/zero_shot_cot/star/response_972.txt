Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 17) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 16) (11, 15) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 2) (12, 15) (15, 18) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 2) (19, 15) (1, 5) (1, 18) (1, 16) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 15) 

Response:
Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three edges connected:
- Node 5 has edges (5, 9), (5, 1), (5, 16), and (5, 14).
- Node 9 has edges (9, 5) and (9, 3).
- Node 13 has edges (13, 8), (13, 17), (13, 2), and (13, 19).
- Node 4 has edges (4, 2), (4, 19), and (4, 14).
- Node 2 has edges (2, 13), (2, 4), (2, 12), and (2, 19).
- Node 12 has edges (12, 2) and (12, 15).
- Node 15 has edges (15, 18), (15, 11), (15, 12), and (15, 19).
- Node 19 has edges (19, 13), (19, 17), (19, 4), and (19, 15).
- Node 1 has edges (1, 5), (1, 18), and (1, 16).
- Node 7 has edges (7, 0), (7, 16), and (7, 6).
- Node 16 has edges (16, 5), (16, 3), (16, 7), and (16, 1).
- Node 0 has edges (0, 8), (0, 18), and (0, 7).
- Node 18 has edges (18, 15), (18, 0), and (18, 1).

2. List the 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 1, 16)>
- <13, (8, 17, 2)>
- <4, (2, 19, 14)>
- <2, (13, 4, 12)>
- <12, (2, 15, 11)>
- <15, (18, 12, 19)>
- <19, (13, 17, 4)>
- <1, (5, 18, 16)>
- <7, (0, 16, 6)>
- <16, (5, 3, 7)>
- <0, (8, 18, 7)>
- <18, (15, 0, 1)>

[The number of 3-stars in the given graph is 12.]
