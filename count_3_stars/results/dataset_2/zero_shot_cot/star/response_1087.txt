Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to find all the 3-stars present in the graph.

Given edges:
(5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) 
(6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (3, 1) 
(3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) 
(11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) 
(8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 11) 
(14, 0) (14, 2) (13, 9) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) 
(2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2)

To identify all the 3-stars, let's look for nodes connected to exactly three other nodes. Since the center node of a 3-star is connected to 3 leaves, we can observe nodes with 3 adjacent edges.

Nodes with 3 adjacent edges:
Node 6, connected to: 9, 1, 2, 11, 4
Node 1, connected to: 5, 9, 6, 3, 11, 8
Node 11, connected to: 6, 1, 10, 14, 0, 4
Node 4, connected to: 6, 3, 11, 8

Thus, we have identified the 3-stars in the graph:
<6, (9, 1, 2)>
<1, (5, 9, 3)>
<11, (6, 10, 14)>
<4, (6, 3, 8)>

Since each 3-star is listed only once, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
