Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 9) (21, 1) (21, 23) (6, 16) (9, 1) (9, 22) (9, 12) (3, 25) (3, 24) (3, 5) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 22) (25, 14) (8, 24) (8, 27) (23, 21) (23, 25) (23, 29) (17, 29) (17, 24) (17, 12) (17, 4) (29, 23) (29, 17) (29, 11) (22, 9) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 24) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 17) (24, 22) (26, 18) (26, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 14) (19, 7) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 11) (18, 26) (18, 15) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 7) (10, 20) (11, 1) (11, 29) (11, 22) (11, 15) (11, 13) (2, 26) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 28) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 20) (7, 14) (20, 10) (20, 2) (20, 7) (12, 9) (12, 17) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 16) (14, 25) (14, 5) (14, 7) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 4) (27, 8) (27, 10) (27, 28) (27, 16) (28, 2) (28, 27) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 27) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star structure. For a 3-star, there should be one central node and three leaf nodes connected to the central node.

From the list of edges, we can identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 21, 11, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 22, and 12.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 25, 24, and 5.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 3, 23, and 22.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 29, 24, and 12.
- Node 29 is connected to nodes 23, 17, and 11.
- Node 22 is connected to nodes 9, 25, and 11.
- Node 24 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 22.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 14.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 17, 5, and 13.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 25, 5, and 7.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 0, 11, and 4.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by combining the above information:
- There are 13 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
- Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (21, 11, 9)>
<3, (25, 24, 5)>
<9, (1, 22, 12)>
<13, (0, 11, 4)>
<17, (29, 24, 12)>
<22, (9, 25, 11)>
<24, (3, 8, 22)>
<25, (3, 23, 22)>
<4, (17, 5, 13)>
<5, (3, 4, 14)>
<29, (23, 17, 11)>
<14, (25, 5, 7)>
<2, (26, 18, 15)>
