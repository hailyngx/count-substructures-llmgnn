Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 17) (11, 20) (16, 21) (16, 29) (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 4) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 26) (27, 23) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 8) (20, 11) (20, 12) (20, 8) (20, 23) (25, 6) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (23, 27) (23, 20) (23, 22) (12, 15) (12, 27) (12, 20) (12, 22) (4, 15) (4, 22) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 20) (8, 19) (8, 29) (29, 16) (29, 8) (29, 9) (10, 17) (10, 19) (10, 24) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 7) (21, 16) (21, 6) (21, 26) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 18) (6, 25) (6, 4) (6, 21) (6, 26) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 24) (2, 22) (2, 24) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 24) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 6) (26, 5) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 7) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 19) (14, 18) (24, 10) (24, 19) (24, 2) (24, 5) (7, 1) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 13) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
The approach is to identify nodes with exactly three connections, which would form a 3-star. Let's list down the 3-stars:

1. <15, (12, 27, 4)>
2. <12, (15, 27, 22)>
3. <27, (15, 12, 26)>
4. <22, (23, 12, 4)>
5. <4, (22, 15, 6)>
6. <26, (27, 21, 5)>
7. <18, (9, 14, 7)>
8. <7, (1, 17, 18)>
9. <13, (3, 0, 7)>
10. <24, (10, 19, 2)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
