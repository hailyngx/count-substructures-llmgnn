Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 15) (11, 7) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 16) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 18) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 17) (9, 10) (9, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 18) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

<2, (3, 8, 10)>
<4, (15, 17, 5)>
<6, (1, 16, 18)>
<7, (3, 11, 17)>
<10, (0, 14, 9)>
<12, (3, 19, 18)>
<15, (3, 4, 11)>
<18, (6, 16, 13)>
<19, (1, 13, 12)>
<3, (2, 7, 12)>
<13, (5, 19, 18)>
<16, (6, 14, 18)>
<17, (8, 7, 4)>
<5, (13, 15, 4)>
<8, (2, 17, 15)>
<1, (6, 19, 2)>
<9, (10, 17, 2)>
<11, (15, 7, 3)>
<14, (10, 4, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].
