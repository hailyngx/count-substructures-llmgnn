Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, satisfying the definition of a 3-star.

Nodes with exactly three edges:
- Node 0
- Node 1
- Node 5

Now, let's go through these nodes one by one and list all the 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: <0, (9, 1, 6)>
- Node 1: <1, (9, 0, 7)>
- Node 5: <5, (8, 4, 7)>, <5, (8, 7, 4)>, <5, (8, 4, 7)>, <5, (8, 7, 4)>, <5, (4, 8, 7)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 4)>, <5, (7, 4, 8)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars in the graph.
