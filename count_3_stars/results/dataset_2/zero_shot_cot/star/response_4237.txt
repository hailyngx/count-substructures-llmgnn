Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (9, 10) (9, 11) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 12) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 1 is connected to 5, 6, 10, and 12.
- Node 3 is connected to 1, 4, 10, and 14.
- Node 10 is connected to 1, 3, 11, 13, and 9.
- Node 11 is connected to 7, 8, 9, and 10.
- Node 13 is connected to 0, 4, 5, and 10.
- Node 14 is connected to 1, 3, 6, and 7.

2. Construct the 3-stars involving the identified nodes:
- <1, (5, 6, 10)>
- <1, (5, 6, 12)>
- <3, (4, 10, 14)>
- <10, (1, 3, 11)>
- <10, (1, 9, 13)>
- <11, (7, 8, 9)>
- <13, (0, 4, 5)>
- <14, (6, 1, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
