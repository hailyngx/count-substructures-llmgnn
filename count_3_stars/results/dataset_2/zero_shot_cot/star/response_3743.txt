Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 10) (9, 16) (14, 18) (14, 1) (17, 20) (17, 15) (17, 4) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 19) (21, 12) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 29) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 3) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 22) (3, 4) (12, 7) (12, 21) (12, 18) (6, 28) (6, 29) (6, 22) (6, 16) (28, 21) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 22) (0, 25) (0, 23) (2, 23) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 2) (26, 28) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 3) (4, 27) (27, 4) (27, 8) (20, 17) (20, 24) (22, 3) (22, 6) (22, 28) (18, 14) (18, 12) (19, 21) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 25) (8, 5) (8, 27) (8, 15) (29, 11) (29, 6) (24, 9) (24, 7) (24, 20) (24, 25) (23, 3) (23, 0) (23, 2) (23, 16) (16, 9) (16, 6) (16, 23) (25, 10) (25, 0) (25, 15) (25, 24) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (13, 8, 10)>
<9, (4, 24, 10)>
<14, (18, 1, 14)>
<17, (20, 15, 4)>
<7, (21, 12, 24)>
<21, (7, 28, 19)>
<10, (5, 9, 11)>
<1, (14, 10, 3)>
<3, (1, 23, 22)>
<12, (7, 21, 18)>
<6, (28, 29, 22)>
<28, (21, 6, 26)>
<4, (9, 17, 3)>
<27, (4, 8, 27)>
<20, (17, 24, 20)>
<22, (3, 6, 28)>
<18, (14, 12, 18)>
<19, (21, 19, 19)>
<15, (17, 8, 15)>
<8, (5, 27, 15)>
<29, (11, 6, 29)>
<24, (9, 7, 20)>
<23, (3, 0, 2)>
<16, (9, 6, 23)>
<25, (10, 0, 15)>

Now, count the total number of 3-stars in the graph: [25]
