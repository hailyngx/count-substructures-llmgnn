Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 11) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 12) (11, 3) (11, 4) (11, 0) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 14) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 9) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a star-like structure.

Let's identify the unique 3-stars in the graph:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 11, 2)>
<4, (1, 8, 11)>
<5, (8, 6, 12)>
<6, (13, 5, 12)>
<7, (13, 0, 2)>
<8, (4, 5, 12)>
<9, (1, 0, 2)>
<10, (13, 5, 0)>
<11, (3, 4, 0)>
<12, (1, 8, 5)>
<13, (2, 10, 7)>
<14, (5, 9, 12)>

Count of 3-stars: [13]
