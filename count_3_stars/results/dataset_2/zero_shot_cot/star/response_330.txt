Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 15) (4, 10) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 6) (13, 5) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 0) (19, 5) (19, 7) (19, 8) (19, 15) (17, 12) (17, 6) (8, 19) (8, 15) (8, 6) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 18) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 16) (18, 9) (18, 3) (18, 6) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 19) (15, 8) (0, 12) (0, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 16) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (16, 3) (16, 14) (16, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify the unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze the graph by looking at each node individually:

1. Node 0: (12, 0), (11, 0) - Not part of any 3-star.
2. Node 1: (6, 1), (2, 1) - Not part of any 3-star.
3. Node 2: (1, 2), (14, 2), (10, 2), (16, 2) - Forms a 3-star: <2, (1, 14, 16)>.
4. Node 3: (11, 3), (16, 3), (18, 3) - Forms a 3-star: <3, (11, 16, 18)>.
5. Node 4: (10, 4), (15, 4) - Not part of any 3-star.
6. Node 5: (9, 5), (13, 5), (19, 5), (10, 5) - Forms a 3-star: <5, (9, 13, 19)>.
7. Node 6: (12, 6), (17, 6), (8, 6), (1, 6), (18, 6) - Not part of any 3-star.
8. Node 7: (12, 7), (19, 7), (14, 7) - Forms a 3-star: <7, (12, 19, 14)>.
9. Node 8: (19, 8), (15, 8), (6, 8) - Not part of any 3-star.
10. Node 9: (5, 9), (18, 9), (15, 9) - Forms a 3-star: <9, (5, 18, 15)>.
11. Node 10: (4, 10), (2, 10), (5, 10) - Not part of any 3-star.
12. Node 11: (3, 11), (0, 11) - Not part of any 3-star.
13. Node 12: (7, 12), (17, 12), (0, 12), (6, 12) - Forms a 3-star: <12, (7, 17, 6)>.
14. Node 13: (5, 13) - Not part of any 3-star.
15. Node 14: (7, 14), (2, 14), (16, 14) - Not part of any 3-star.
16. Node 15: (9, 15), (4, 15), (19, 15), (8, 15) - Forms a 3-star: <15, (9, 4, 19)>.
17. Node 16: (3, 16), (14, 16), (2, 16) - Not part of any 3-star.
18. Node 17: (12, 17), (6, 17) - Not part of any 3-star.
19. Node 18: (9, 18), (3, 18), (6, 18) - Not part of any 3-star.
20. Node 19: (5, 19), (7, 19), (8, 19), (15, 19) - Not part of any 3-star.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (1, 14, 16)>, <3, (11, 16, 18)>, <5, (9, 13, 19)>, <7, (12, 19, 14)>, and <15, (9, 4, 19)>.

By counting the number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of [5].
