Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with the highest degree, which would be the potential center nodes for 3-stars. Given the number of edges incident to each node:

Node 5 has degree 5.
Node 4 has degree 5.
Node 6 has degree 5.
Node 0 has degree 4.
Node 9 has degree 4.
Node 1 has degree 4.
Node 3 has degree 4.
Node 7 has degree 3.
Node 2 has degree 3.
Node 8 has degree 1.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in the graph:

1. <5, (9, 4, 0)>
2. <9, (5, 3, 1)>
3. <4, (5, 7, 2)>
4. <7, (5, 4, 3)>
5. <0, (5, 9, 1)>
6. <1, (9, 3, 6)>
7. <3, (9, 7, 6)>
8. <6, (5, 4, 1)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
