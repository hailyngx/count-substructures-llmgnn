Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes and can act as the center of a 3-star. These nodes will have a degree of 3 in the graph. Based on the given edges, nodes 6, 1, 4, 8, and 5 have a degree of 3.

Now, we will identify the 3-stars in the graph that have one of these nodes as the center. 

For node 6:
- <6, (5, 3, 2)>
- <6, (5, 4, 2)>

For node 1:
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <1, (9, 0, 7)>

For node 4:
- <4, (6, 1, 2)>
- <4, (6, 8, 2)>

For node 8:
- <8, (9, 4, 5)>
- <8, (4, 5, 0)>

For node 5:
- <5, (6, 3, 2)>
- <5, (6, 8, 2)>
- <5, (3, 8, 0)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [9] 3-stars in the given graph.
