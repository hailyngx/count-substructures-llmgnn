Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 22) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 24) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 25) (22, 21) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 20) (23, 9) (10, 13) (10, 29) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 11) (26, 25) (26, 27) (29, 10) (29, 17) (29, 20) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 13) (4, 28) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 2) (27, 26) (27, 4) (27, 16) (27, 6) (16, 12) (16, 27) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 28) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 1) (6, 27) (6, 25) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 24) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 25) (5, 24) (19, 28) (19, 4) (19, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 23) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 5) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to find all the configurations where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's begin by listing all the 3-stars:

<1, (21, 6, 0)>
<3, (15, 11, 20)>
<15, (3, 24, 9)>
<18, (11, 17, 25)>
<22, (21, 23, 0)>
<23, (22, 20, 9)>
<10, (13, 29, 17)>
<17, (18, 29, 13)>
<26, (25, 27, 6)>
<7, (12, 11, 8)>
<12, (7, 16, 14)>
<28, (11, 4, 19)>
<4, (28, 27, 0)>
<27, (26, 4, 16)>
<16, (12, 27, 6)>
<13, (10, 17, 28)>
<20, (3, 23, 29)>
<14, (12, 2, 27)>
<9, (23, 20, 24)>
<2, (4, 14, 19)>
<5, (24)>
<8, (7)>
<0, (1, 23, 4)>
<19, (28, 4, 2)>
<25, (18, 26, 6)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars we found: [26].
