Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form a 3-star pattern. 
Nodes connected to 3 other nodes are potential centers of 3-star graphs. Based on the given edges, we have the following nodes: 
- Node 4 is connected to 5 other nodes (9, 7, 8, 1, 3)
- Node 7 is connected to 5 other nodes (9, 4, 3, 6, 2)
- Node 1 is connected to 5 other nodes (4, 3, 2, 0, 8)
- Node 3 is connected to 5 other nodes (9, 4, 7, 1, 0)
- Node 2 is connected to 5 other nodes (9, 7, 1, 8, 6)
- Node 0 is connected to 5 other nodes (5, 1, 3, 6)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph by identifying the unique 3-stars that can be formed:

1. Node 4 as the center: <4, (9, 7, 8)> 
2. Node 7 as the center: <7, (9, 4, 3)> 
3. Node 1 as the center: <1, (4, 3, 2)> 
4. Node 3 as the center: <3, (9, 4, 0)> 

Therefore, there are 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
