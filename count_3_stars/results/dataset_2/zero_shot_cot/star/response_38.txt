Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will look for nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's determine the 3-stars present in the graph.

The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

1. Node 9:
   - (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 3): <9, (5, 2, 3)>

2. Node 1:
   - (1, 9), (1, 3), (1, 6): <1, (9, 3, 6)>

3. Node 7:
   - (7, 9), (7, 0), (7, 6): <7, (9, 0, 6)>

4. Node 3:
   - (3, 9), (3, 4), (3, 1): <3, (9, 4, 1)>
   - (3, 8), (3, 6), (3, 1): <3, (8, 6, 1)>

5. Node 0:
   - (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8): <0, (5, 7, 8)>
   - (0, 6), (0, 2), (0, 8): <0, (6, 2, 8)>

Thus, there are a total of [5] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
