Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (4, 19) (4, 11) (4, 15) (8, 10) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 15) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 9) (15, 4) (15, 14) (15, 2) (15, 5) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 9) (16, 7) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 19) (17, 6) (17, 19) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 18) (19, 4) (19, 6) (19, 17) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 11) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 0) (13, 1) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 5) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

First, we need to identify the nodes that are part of a 3-star configuration.
A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. 

Looking at the provided edges, we can identify the following 3-stars:
<1, (3, 11, 14)>
<3, (1, 10, 5)>
<4, (19, 11, 15)>
<14, (1, 3, 0)>
<15, (4, 14, 2)>
<7, (16, 6, 9)>
<6, (7, 17, 2)>
<17, (6, 19, 2)>
<11, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 15, 18)>

These are all the unique 3-stars found in the given graph. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
