Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify all the nodes with exactly three adjacent edges. These nodes can potentially form the center of a 3-star. Next, we check if any of the nodes connected to these nodes share two other edges with them. Such nodes will be the leaves of the 3-star. 

Now, let's go through the analysis step by step:

Nodes with exactly three adjacent edges:
- Node 0: (5, 0), (9, 0), (1, 0), (4, 0), (8, 0)
- Node 3: (9, 3), (6, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3)
- Node 4: (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)
- Node 6: (9, 6), (1, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (8, 6)
- Node 7: (1, 7), (4, 7), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 8)

Nodes connected to the above nodes with two common edges:
- Node 5 has common edges with node 0 and 4: (5, 4), (5, 0)
- Node 9 has common edges with node 0, 3, and 6: (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6), (0, 9)
- Node 1 has common edges with node 0, 3, and 6: (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 7)
- Node 8 has common edges with nodes 0, 4, 6, and 7: (8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7)

Now, let's construct the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (4, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
