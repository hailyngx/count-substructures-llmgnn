Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to the center node in each 3-star.

1. Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 10, 1, and 12.
2. Node 6 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 7, 8, and 13.
3. Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 10, and 12.
4. Node 13 is connected to nodes 6, 8, 11, 3, and 14.
5. Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 8, and 11.
6. Node 11 is connected to nodes 13, 10, 0, and 4.
7. Node 0 is connected to nodes 11, 14, 1, and 2.
8. Node 14 is connected to nodes 6, 13, 0, 3, 7, and 4.
9. Node 2 is connected to nodes 11 and 0.
10. Node 3 is connected to nodes 13, 14, 7, and 12.
11. Node 7 is connected to nodes 6, 14, 2, 3, and 1.
12. Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 0, 7, and 12.
13. Node 4 is connected to nodes 11, 14.
14. Node 12 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 3, and 1.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph.
To form a 3-star, we need a center node connected to exactly three other nodes.

There are no 3-stars in this graph.
