Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 16) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 7) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 8) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 12) (0, 15) (7, 10) (7, 1) (7, 2) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 4) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (19, 15) (19, 4) (19, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 8) (18, 10) (8, 17) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 7) (2, 16) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 19) (3, 8) (3, 2)
