Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 2) (1, 24) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 26) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 21) (7, 4) (7, 25) (7, 27) (7, 13) (20, 25) (20, 3) (20, 24) (25, 7) (25, 20) (25, 29) (12, 0) (27, 7) (27, 23) (27, 17) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (18, 19) (18, 23) (11, 8) (11, 28) (11, 29) (11, 15) (28, 11) (28, 22) (3, 20) (3, 23) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (15, 11) (15, 10) (15, 26) (15, 24) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 9) (26, 21) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 23) (26, 17) (19, 18) (19, 0) (22, 28) (22, 14) (22, 6) (23, 27) (23, 18) (23, 3) (23, 26) (29, 25) (29, 11) (17, 27) (17, 26) (17, 16) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 17) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 22) (9, 14) (9, 24) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 19) (24, 1) (24, 20) (24, 15) (24, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars in the graph. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

The possible 3-stars in this graph are:
<1, (2, 24, 21)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (4, 21, 25)>
<8, (2, 16, 11)>
<11, (8, 15, 29)>
<13, (0, 7, 5)>
<15, (11, 24, 26)>
<20, (3, 25, 24)>
<22, (6, 14, 28)>
<23, (3, 26, 27)>
<25, (7, 20, 29)>
<26, (15, 21, 14)>
<27, (17, 7, 23)>
<28, (11, 22, 18)>
<29, (11, 25, 17)>

Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: [15]
