Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 17) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 9) (10, 8) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (2, 11) (2, 18) (2, 12) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 0) (18, 12) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (8, 10) (8, 17) (13, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (0, 9) (4, 13) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 18) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 19) (15, 19) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 15) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph step by step:

1. Identify the nodes with exactly 3 edges:
- Node 11 has edges with nodes 1, 0, and 9.
- Node 16 has edges with nodes 0, 17, and 11.
- Node 1 has edges with nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 has edges with nodes 1, 14, and 9.
- Node 18 has edges with nodes 2, 0, and 12.
- Node 5 has edges with nodes 6, 13, and 7.
- Node 8 has edges with nodes 10, 17, and 8.
- Node 13 has edges with nodes 5, 4, and 19.
- Node 0 has edges with nodes 18, 16, and 9.
- Node 19 has edges with nodes 7, 15, and 13.

2. Construct the list of 3-stars using the identified nodes:
- <11, (1, 0, 9)>
- <16, (0, 17, 11)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 14, 9)>
- <18, (2, 0, 12)>
- <5, (6, 13, 7)>
- <8, (10, 17, 8)>
- <13, (5, 4, 19)>
- <0, (18, 16, 9)>
- <19, (7, 15, 13)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
