Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 8) (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 14) (16, 20) (14, 16) (14, 9) (17, 22) (17, 19) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 19) (21, 25) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 20) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 29) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 19) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 6) (20, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 0) (3, 21) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 28) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 10) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 10) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 0) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 28) (28, 15) (28, 25) (28, 8) (24, 5) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 0) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 5) (0, 18) (0, 26) (0, 5) (0, 1) (10, 12) (10, 29) (10, 2) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the instances where a central node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step by step:

1. Start with the edges involving each node:
- Node 1: (12, 1), (1, 29), (1, 0)
- Node 2: (22, 2), (2, 4), (2, 10)
- Node 3: (21, 3)
- Node 4: (4, 29), (4, 2)
- Node 5: (5, 26), (5, 23), (5, 24), (5, 0)
- Node 6: (6, 9), (6, 25), (6, 18), (6, 23), (6, 20)
- Node 7: (7, 21), (7, 25), (7, 23)
- Node 8: (22, 8), (8, 20), (8, 28)
- Node 9: (9, 22), (9, 14), (9, 6), (9, 29)
- Node 10: (12, 10), (10, 29), (10, 2)
- Node 11: (11, 16)
- Node 12: (12, 10), (12, 1), (12, 19)
- Node 13: (13, 22)
- Node 14: (14, 16), (14, 9)
- Node 15: (15, 20), (15, 18), (15, 28)
- Node 16: (16, 11), (16, 14), (16, 20)
- Node 17: (17, 22), (17, 19)
- Node 18: (18, 15), (18, 6), (18, 19), (18, 0)
- Node 19: (19, 17), (19, 21), (19, 12), (19, 18), (19, 26)
- Node 20: (20, 16), (20, 15), (20, 6), (20, 8)
- Node 21: (21, 7), (21, 3), (21, 19), (21, 25)
- Node 22: (22, 13), (22, 9), (22, 17), (22, 8)
- Node 23: (23, 7), (23, 6), (23, 5)
- Node 24: (24, 5)
- Node 25: (25, 7), (25, 21), (25, 6), (25, 28)
- Node 26: (26, 19), (26, 5), (26, 0)
- Node 28: (28, 15), (28, 25), (28, 8)
- Node 29: (29, 9), (29, 4), (29, 1), (29, 10)

2. Identify the 3-stars:
- <1, (12, 1, 0)>
- <2, (22, 2, 4)>
- <4, (2, 4, 29)>
- <5, (26, 5, 24)>
- <6, (9, 6, 23)>
- <7, (21, 7, 25)>
- <8, (22, 8, 28)>
- <9, (22, 9, 14)>
- <10, (12, 10, 29)>
- <11, (16, 11, 14)>
- <12, (10, 12, 1)>
- <15, (18, 15, 28)>
- <17, (22, 17, 19)>
- <18, (15, 18, 0)>
- <19, (26, 19, 12)>
- <20, (16, 20, 15)>
- <21, (25, 21, 7)>
- <22, (17, 22, 8)>
- <23, (5, 23, 24)>
- <25, (7, 25, 21)>
- <26, (19, 26, 5)>
- <28, (25, 28, 8)>
- <29, (9, 29, 4)>

From the identified 3-stars, there are 23 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the final answer is [23].
