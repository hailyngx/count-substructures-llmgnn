Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 2, and 3.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 4, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 1.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 9, 3, and 6.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 6.

2. List down all unique 3-stars:
- <5, (9, 4, 6)>
- <9, (5, 2, 3)>
- <4, (5, 7, 1)>
- <7, (4, 0, 3)>
- <1, (9, 4, 7)>
- <3, (9, 7, 1)>
- <8, (4, 1, 3)>
- <6, (5, 8, 2)>

3. Calculate the total number of 3-stars: 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [8].
