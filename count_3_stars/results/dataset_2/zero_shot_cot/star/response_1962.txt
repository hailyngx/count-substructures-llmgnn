Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 15) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 19) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 15) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 16) (2, 11) (18, 2) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 15) (4, 3) (4, 6) (1, 17) (1, 0) (1, 13) (1, 7) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (19, 10) (19, 2) (19, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 2) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (3, 10) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 4) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 10) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 6) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) 

Response:
At first, let's identify all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 3, and 1.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 18, 19, and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 10, 17, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 14, 4, and 13.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 10, 7, and 12.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 19.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 2, 1, and 7.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 11, 6, and 15.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 5, 17, and 14.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (5, 3, 1)>
<2, (18, 19, 13)>
<3, (10, 17, 4)>
<6, (14, 4, 13)>
<7, (1, 8, 19)>
<8, (10, 7, 12)>
<10, (3, 8, 19)>
<13, (2, 1, 7)>
<14, (11, 6, 15)>
<15, (5, 17, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
