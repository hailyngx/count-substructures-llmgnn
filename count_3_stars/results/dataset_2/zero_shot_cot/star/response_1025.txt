Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify each 3-star pattern.

First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 8.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [2].
