Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 27) (11, 20) (16, 29) (16, 9) (16, 6) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 22) (5, 29) (9, 16) (9, 25) (9, 15) (15, 9) (15, 2) (27, 11) (27, 28) (27, 26) (27, 8) (18, 26) (18, 19) (22, 5) (22, 24) (10, 26) (10, 7) (6, 16) (6, 5) (6, 29) (28, 27) (28, 19) (28, 2) (28, 23) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 28) (19, 26) (19, 17) (26, 27) (26, 18) (26, 10) (26, 19) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 20) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 3) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (17, 19) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 23) (0, 12) (3, 12) (3, 17) (25, 9) (25, 21) (13, 21) (13, 4) (21, 25) (21, 13) (21, 23) (21, 2) (8, 5) (8, 27) (20, 11) (20, 7) (20, 4) (2, 15) (2, 28) (2, 1) (2, 21) (29, 16) (29, 5) (29, 6) (24, 22) (24, 14) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 20) (4, 14) (23, 28) (23, 17) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 24) (14, 4) (14, 23) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected in such a way that forms a 3-star structure. A 3-star consists of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges.

Let's list the unique 3-stars in the graph:

<7, (10, 20, 28)>
<9, (15, 25, 16)>
<11, (19, 27, 20)>
<12, (0, 3, 7)>
<17, (1, 3, 23)>
<21, (2, 13, 25)>
<24, (14, 22, 4)>
<26, (10, 18, 27)>
<29, (5, 6, 16)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
