Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the graph. 
We notice that nodes 4, 7, 9, 6, 1, 8, 0, and 5 are all connected to at least one other node. 
Any 3-star in the graph must have one of these nodes as its center, as a 3-star has a central node connected to exactly three other nodes.

Examining the graph, we find the following 3-stars:
<4, (7, 9, 5)>
<7, (4, 9, 5)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 1, 3)>
<1, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (6, 9, 5)>
<0, (6, 9, 1)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>

Counting the unique 3-stars, we find that there are [8] 3-stars in total.
