Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges, which will be the potential centers of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 4 edges
- Node 4 has 5 edges
- Node 5 has 4 edges
- Node 6 has 3 edges
- Node 7 has 5 edges
- Node 8 has 4 edges
- Node 10 has 3 edges
- Node 11 has 3 edges
- Node 12 has 5 edges

Based on this information, we can see that nodes 6, 10, and 11 are the potential centers of 3-stars.

Let's now look at the neighboring nodes of each potential center to form 3-stars:

1. For node 6: (6, 9), (6, 3), (6, 2)
   <6, (9, 3, 2)>

2. For node 10: (10, 11), (10, 4), (10, 13)
   <10, (11, 4, 13)>

3. For node 11: (11, 10), (11, 12), (11, 4)
   <11, (10, 12, 4)>

Therefore, there are 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
