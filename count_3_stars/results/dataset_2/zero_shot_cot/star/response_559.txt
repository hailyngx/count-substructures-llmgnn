Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (8, 16) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 18) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (5, 0) (5, 4) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 18) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) 

Response:
First, let's find nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes could potentially be the center of a 3-star.

Nodes with degree 3:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 16, and 6.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 19.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 18.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 9, 14, and 19.

Next, we can check which of these nodes, when considered as the center of a 3-star, actually form valid 3-stars with their neighbors. 

The number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1].
The unique 3-star found is <0, (3, 4, 5)>.
