Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to node 4. Then, we can determine the 3-stars that have node 4 as the center.

- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7, 9, 0, 5, 1, and 6.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center:

<4, (7, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 8, 9)>
<4, (5, 1, 6)>

Counting the number of unique 3-stars: [3].
