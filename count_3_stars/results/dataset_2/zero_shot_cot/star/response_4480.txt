Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 16) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 9) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 9) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 1) (7, 14) (12, 1) (12, 4) (12, 0) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 15) (19, 13) (19, 17) (19, 6) (19, 9) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 14) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 17) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 6) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 19) (9, 4) (17, 19) (17, 4) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [6].

<1, (16, 12, 7)>
<5, (11, 4, 2)>
<9, (10, 2, 19)>
<10, (11, 15, 18)>
<12, (1, 0, 4)>
<14, (18, 7, 6)>
