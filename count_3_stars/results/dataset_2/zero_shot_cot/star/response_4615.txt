Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (5, 22) (9, 5) (9, 3) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (27, 28) (27, 8) (2, 29) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 4) (20, 21) (20, 3) (25, 2) (25, 16) (25, 10) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (14, 7) (14, 21) (17, 28) (17, 22) (17, 18) (13, 0) (13, 4) (13, 23) (13, 18) (26, 16) (26, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 23) (7, 1) (8, 27) (8, 6) (8, 15) (8, 21) (10, 0) (10, 25) (12, 26) (12, 19) (4, 29) (4, 13) (4, 15) (22, 5) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 24) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 24) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 15) (23, 5) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 28) (19, 7) (19, 12) (28, 27) (28, 17) (28, 23) (21, 20) (21, 14) (21, 8) (3, 9) (3, 20) (3, 16) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 16) (18, 24) (24, 22) (24, 1) (24, 18) (16, 25) (16, 26) (16, 3) (16, 18) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 22) (15, 11) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in this graph step by step:
1. Identify the center nodes which have exactly three edges:
   - Node 5, 9, 0, 29, 4, 22, 21, 13, 7, 8, 10, 12, 1, 11, 23, and 28

2. For each center node, identify the adjacent nodes connected by edges:
   - Center node 5: (9, 6, 23)
   - Center node 9: (5, 3)
   - Center node 0: (7, 10, 13)
   - Center node 29: (2, 4)
   - Center node 4: (29, 13, 15)
   - Center node 22: (5, 17, 15)
   - Center node 21: (20, 14, 8)
   - Center node 13: (0, 4, 23)
   - Center node 7: (0, 14, 19)
   - Center node 8: (27, 6, 15)
   - Center node 10: (0, 25)
   - Center node 12: (26, 19)
   - Center node 1: (7, 11, 24)
   - Center node 11: (6, 1, 15)
   - Center node 23: (5, 13, 7)
   - Center node 28: (27, 17, 23)

3. List the unique 3-stars found:
   <5, (9, 6, 23)>
   <9, (5, 3, 0)>
   <0, (7, 10, 13)>
   <29, (2, 4, 15)>
   <4, (29, 13, 15)>
   <22, (5, 17, 15)>
   <21, (20, 14, 8)>
   <13, (0, 4, 23)>
   <7, (0, 14, 19)>
   <8, (27, 6, 15)>
   <10, (0, 25)>
   <12, (26, 19, 15)>
   <1, (7, 11, 24)>
   <11, (6, 1, 15)>
   <23, (5, 13, 7)>
   <28, (27, 17, 23)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [16].
