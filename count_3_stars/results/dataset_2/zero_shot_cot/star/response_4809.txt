Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will look for nodes that are connected in the pattern of a central node with three leaf nodes. 

Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 5: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) -> <5, (2, 1, 4)>
2. Node 9: (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) -> <9, (2, 1, 7)>
3. Node 4: (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) -> <4, (5, 7, 8)>
4. Node 7: (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) -> <7, (5, 9, 4)>
5. Node 1: (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) -> <1, (5, 9, 4)>
6. Node 3: (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) -> <3, (7, 1, 6)>
7. Node 8: (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) -> <8, (4, 0, 6)>
8. Node 2: (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) -> <2, (5, 9, 3)>
9. Node 6: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) -> <6, (7, 3, 8)>
10. Node 0: (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) -> <0, (9, 1, 8)>

Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars in the given graph. So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
