Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 11) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 0) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (0, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 9) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

1. <4, (7, 1, 12)>
2. <7, (4, 3, 10)>
3. <1, (4, 3, 5)>
4. <3, (7, 1, 6)>
5. <8, (13, 2, 11)>
6. <13, (7, 8, 11)>
7. <2, (8, 5, 9)>
8. <12, (4, 2, 0)>
9. <11, (4, 8, 13)>
10. <14, (4, 11, 9)>
11. <0, (12, 2, 0)>
12. <5, (1, 3, 2)>
13. <6, (7, 3, 8)>
14. <9, (1, 2, 14)>
15. <10, (7, 1, 13)>

Therefore, there are [15] 3-stars in the given graph.
