Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 2) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (12, 0) (12, 5) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 3) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<6, (9, 14, 7)>
<9, (6, 2, 10)>
<4, (7, 8, 0)>
<7, (6, 4, 3)>
<2, (9, 7, 11)>
<1, (9, 5, 10)>
<0, (4, 2, 12)>
<10, (6, 9, 1)>
<11, (2, 5, 12)>
<3, (6, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 11, 12)>
<14, (6, 9, 10)>
<12, (0, 5, 14)>
<13, (9, 1, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
