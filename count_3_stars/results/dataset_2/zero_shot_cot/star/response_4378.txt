Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that form 3-stars:
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 9, 8, 4, and 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 11, 1, 0, and 12.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 13, 6, and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 4, 0, and 14.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5 and 3.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 6.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 11, 3, 6, and 12.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 9, 13, and 10.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 7, 14, and 12.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 3, and 1.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 1, and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 9, 14, 2, 6.

Now, let's count the 3-stars:
- Node 5: <5, (9, 8, 4)> 
- Node 9: <9, (5, 11, 1)>
- Node 4: <4, (5, 7, 13)>
- Node 7: <7, (4, 0, 14)>
- Node 8: <8, (5, 3, None)>
- Node 13: <13, (4, 11, 6)>
- Node 10: <10, (11, 3, 6)>
- Node 11: <11, (9, 13, 10)>
- Node 0: <0, (9, 7, 14)>
- Node 14: <14, (7, 0, 3)>
- Node 2: <2, (4, 1, 3)>
- Node 1: <1, (9, 14, 2)>

So, there are a total of [12] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
