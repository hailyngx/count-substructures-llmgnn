Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 14) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 11) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (10, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) 

Response:
The central node of a 3-star must be connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph based on this condition.

1. Central node 5: (5, 9), (5, 13), (5, 2) => <5, (9, 13, 2)>
2. Central node 9: (9, 5), (9, 2), (9, 11) => <9, (5, 2, 11)>
3. Central node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 8) => <6, (1, 2, 8)>
4. Central node 1: (1, 6), (1, 3), (1, 0) => <1, (6, 3, 0)>
5. Central node 3: (3, 1), (3, 13), (3, 8) => <3, (1, 13, 8)>
6. Central node 8: (8, 6), (8, 3), (8, 13) => <8, (6, 3, 13)>
7. Central node 13: (13, 5), (13, 3), (13, 8) => <13, (5, 3, 8)>
8. Central node 7: (7, 9), (7, 8), (7, 11) => <7, (9, 8, 11)>
9. Central node 12: (12, 3), (12, 4), (12, 14) => <12, (3, 4, 14)>

There are 9 unique 3-stars in the given graph. [9]
