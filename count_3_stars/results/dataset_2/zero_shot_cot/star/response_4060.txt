Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 12) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.

If we examine the list of edges provided, we find that nodes 0, 2, and 7 are connected to exactly three other nodes each. Let's list the unique 3-stars using these nodes as centers:

<0, (9, 10, 11)>
<2, (1, 10, 14)>
<7, (11, 0, 13)>

Therefore, there are [3] unique 3-stars in the given graph.
