Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 15) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 18) (11, 14) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 13) (14, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 15) (7, 9) (15, 2) (15, 7) (15, 17) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 16) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 13) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 0) (13, 14) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 19) (18, 12) (18, 0) (18, 17) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 16) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 19) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes. 

First, let's list all nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, 18, and 19.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 8, 15.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 12.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3.
- Node 6 is connected to node 0.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 8, 9, 15.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 7, 10, 13.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 9, 13, 14, 16.
- Node 11 is connected to node 14.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 10, 14, 19.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 10, 11, 13, 16.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 2, 7, 17.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 10, 14, 19.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 15, 18.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 0, 12, 17.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 0, 13, 16.

From the list above, we can find the unique 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (2, 8, 15)>
- <8, (1, 2, 3)>
- <10, (9, 13, 14)>
- <14, (10, 13, 16)>
- <15, (2, 7, 17)>
- <16, (10, 14, 19)>
- <18, (12, 0, 17)>
- <19, (13, 0, 16)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].
