Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 11) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 3) (10, 8) (10, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 2) (7, 11) (7, 0) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 15) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 4) (18, 15) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 19) (13, 5) (13, 19) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 13) (19, 8) (19, 15) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 19) (1, 5) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

- Node 5: (5, 9, 13)
- Node 9: (9, 5, 6)
- Node 14: (14, 17, 0)
- Node 17: (17, 14, 6)
- Node 6: (6, 9, 17)
- Node 12: (12, 14, 4)
- Node 4: (4, 12, 18)
- Node 18: (18, 10, 4)
- Node 0: (0, 14, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 11, 0)
- Node 15: (15, 4, 19)
- Node 19: (19, 9, 0)
  
Now, let's count the total number of 3-stars: <5, (9, 13, 5)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <14, (17, 0, 14)>, <17, (14, 6, 17)>, <6, (9, 17, 6)>, <12, (14, 4, 12)>, <4, (12, 18, 4)>, <18, (10, 4, 18)>, <0, (14, 7, 0)>, <7, (11, 0, 7)>, <15, (4, 19, 15)>, <19, (9, 0, 19)>. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
