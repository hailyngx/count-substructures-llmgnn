Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
The center of a 3-star must have exactly 3 neighbors. 
Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:

<6, (1, 12, 13)>
<9, (11, 14, 7)>
<10, (11, 7, 4)>
<4, (10, 13, 3)>
<0, (9, 12, 7)>
<14, (9, 10, 6)>
<2, (4, 0, 5)>
<3, (8, 13, 4)>
<7, (9, 10, 5)>
<1, (6, 11, 8)>
<5, (8, 2, 7)>
<12, (6, 9, 13)>

Therefore, there are 12 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the answer is [12].
