Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
First, let's identify all nodes that are connected to node 4 since node 4 is the center of a 3-star graph. The nodes connected to node 4 are 2, 9, 1, and 6. 

Next, let's check if any of these nodes are connected to each other, which would form a 3-star. 
1. Nodes 2, 9, and 1 are not connected to each other. Therefore, there is no 3-star with center node 4.
2. Node 6 is connected to node 4 and node 9. So, the 3-star <4, (6, 9, 4)> is found.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1], and the unique 3-star found in the graph is <4, (6, 9, 4)>.
