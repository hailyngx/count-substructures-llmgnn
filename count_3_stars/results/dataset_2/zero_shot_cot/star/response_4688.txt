Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 0) 

Response:
The number of 3-stars can be calculated by finding the center node and its adjacent nodes. Let's go step-by-step to count the 3-stars.

Step 1: Identify the nodes connected to each node.
Node 0: (6, 8, 2, 5)
Node 1: (4, 7, 6, 9, 3)
Node 2: (9, 3, 8, 0)
Node 3: (4, 1, 2, 8)
Node 4: (7, 1, 6, 3)
Node 5: (0)
Node 6: (4, 7, 9, 1, 0)
Node 7: (4, 6, 9, 1)
Node 8: (3, 2, 0)
Node 9: (7, 6, 1, 2)

Step 2: Identify all the 3-stars in the graph.

<0, (6, 8, 2)>
<1, (4, 7, 6)>
<2, (9, 3, 8)>
<3, (4, 1, 2)>
<4, (7, 1, 6)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 2, 0)>
<9, (7, 6, 1)>

Step 3: Count the total number of unique 3-stars found.
