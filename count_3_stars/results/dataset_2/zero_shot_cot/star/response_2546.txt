Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 9) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (12, 4) (12, 18) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 5) (9, 18) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 7) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 17) (6, 15) (6, 7) (6, 17) (17, 0) (17, 7) (17, 6) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 13) (13, 3) (13, 18) (13, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 14) (10, 7) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all the unique 3-stars. 

Let's analyze the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 16, 17, and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 11, 2, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 15, 1, 16, and 13.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 0, 13, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 18, 12, and 19.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 18, 0, and 14.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 15, 7, and 17.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 9, 6, 10, and 17.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 1, 19, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 18, 19, 14, and 7.
- Node 10 is connected to node 7.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 1.
- Node 12 is connected to nodes 4, 18.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 3, 2, and 18.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 9 and 5.
- Node 15 is connected to nodes 6, 2.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 17 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 6.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 4, 9, 5, 12, 13.
- Node 19 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars by listing the unique 3-stars:
<2, (15, 1, 16)>
<3, (7, 0, 13)>
<4, (12, 18, 19)>
<5, (14, 9, 5)>
<6, (17, 7, 6)>
<8, (19, 4, 8)>
<9, (7, 9, 14)>
<18, (13, 3, 18)>

Thus, there are a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
