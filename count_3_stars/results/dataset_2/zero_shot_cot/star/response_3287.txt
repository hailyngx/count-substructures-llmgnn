Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify the central node of each 3-star by looking for nodes with exactly three edges. 

The nodes with exactly three edges are: 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, 0, 2, 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

<5, (9, 6, 1)>
<9, (5, 6, 3)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<1, (5, 3, 4)>
<3, (5, 9, 1)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
<8, (4, 5, 2)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<2, (6, 4, 7)>
<7, (9, 1, 0)>

Since each 3-star is unique, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 10. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
