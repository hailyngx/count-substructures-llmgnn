Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

Node 0: 14, 12, 13, 2
Node 1: 9, 7, 6, 11, 10
Node 2: 0, 8, 13
Node 3: 4, 8, 10
Node 4: 9, 7, 14, 11, 3
Node 5: 6, 13, 7, 14
Node 6: 5, 1, 12
Node 7: 5, 4, 1
Node 8: 14, 2, 10, 3
Node 9: 4, 11, 1, 12
Node 10: 8, 1, 3
Node 11: 9, 4, 13, 1
Node 12: 9, 6, 0, 13
Node 13: 5, 0, 14, 2, 12
Node 14: 5, 4, 0, 8, 13

For each node, we will check if it forms a 3-star with its neighbors:

- Node 0 does NOT form a 3-star.
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors (9, 11, 10) <1, (9, 11, 10)>.
- Node 2 does NOT form a 3-star.
- Node 3 does NOT form a 3-star.
- Node 4 does NOT form a 3-star.
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with neighbors (6, 7, 14) <5, (6, 7, 14)>.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with neighbors (1, 12, 5) <6, (1, 12, 5)>.
- Node 7 does NOT form a 3-star.
- Node 8 does NOT form a 3-star.
- Node 9 does NOT form a 3-star.
- Node 10 does NOT form a 3-star.
- Node 11 forms a 3-star with neighbors (9, 4, 13) <11, (9, 4, 13)>.
- Node 12 does NOT form a 3-star.
- Node 13 forms a 3-star with neighbors (5, 0, 14) <13, (5, 0, 14)>.
- Node 14 does NOT form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <1, (9, 11, 10)>, <5, (6, 7, 14)>, <13, (5, 0, 14)>.
