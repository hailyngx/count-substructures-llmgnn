Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we identify each central node and the three connected nodes. 

1. Central node 5: 
   - <5, (9, 0, 3)>
   - <5, (2, 0, 3)>

2. Central node 9: 
   - <9, (5, 4, 1)>
   - <9, (4, 1, 0)>
   - <9, (1, 4, 0)>
   
3. Central node 4: 
   - <4, (9, 7, 8)>
   - <4, (7, 8, 6)>
   - <4, (8, 6, 2)>
   - <4, (6, 8, 2)>
   
4. Central node 7: 
   - <7, (4, 3, 6)>
   
5. Central node 6: 
   - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
   
6. Central node 8: 
   - <8, (4, 6, 1)>
   
7. Central node 0: 
   - <0, (5, 9, 3)>
   - <0, (9, 3, 1)>
   - <0, (3, 5, 1)>
   
8. Central node 2: 
   - <2, (5, 4, 7)>
   
9. Central node 1: 
   - <1, (9, 8, 0)>

10. Central node 3: 
    - <3, (5, 4, 7)>
    
Counting all the unique 3-stars, we find a total of [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
