Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 11) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 9) (2, 14) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 9) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes connected to each node:

- Node 1: 3, 10, 4, 8, 7
- Node 3: 1, 7, 10, 6
- Node 8: 1, 13, 5, 14, 11, 12
- Node 13: 8, 12, 4, 6
- Node 5: 8, 12
- Node 6: 3, 13, 11
- Node 4: 1, 13, 12, 9
- Node 12: 8, 13, 5, 4, 10, 0
- Node 7: 1, 3, 11, 14, 9
- Node 2: 14
- Node 0: 12, 11, 9
- Node 11: 8, 6, 7, 0, 9
- Node 14: 8, 7, 2
- Node 9: 4, 7, 0, 11, 10
- Node 10: 1, 3, 12, 9

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 1: (1, 3, 4), (1, 7, 8), (1, 10, 4) -> Total: 3
- Node 3: (3, 1, 7), (3, 6, 13), (3, 10, 1) -> Total: 3
- Node 8: (8, 1, 13), (8, 5, 12), (8, 11, 6) -> Total: 3
- Node 13: (13, 8, 12), (13, 4, 6), (13, 6, 3) -> Total: 3
- Node 5: (5, 8, 12) -> Total: 1
- Node 6: (6, 3, 13), (6, 11, 8) -> Total: 2
- Node 4: (4, 1, 13), (4, 12, 5), (4, 9, 7) -> Total: 3
- Node 12: (12, 8, 13), (12, 5, 4), (12, 0, 11) -> Total: 3
- Node 7: (7, 1, 3), (7, 14, 8), (7, 11, 9) -> Total: 3
- Node 0: (0, 12, 11), (0, 11, 9) -> Total: 2
- Node 11: (11, 8, 6), (11, 7, 9), (11, 0, 12) -> Total: 3
- Node 14: (14, 8, 7) -> Total: 1
- Node 9: (9, 4, 7), (9, 7, 11), (9, 0, 11) -> Total: 3
- Node 10: (10, 1, 3), (10, 12, 9), (10, 9, 4) -> Total: 3

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is: [31]
And the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (3, 4, 10)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 10)>, <8, (1, 13, 5)>, <8, (6, 11, 12)>, <8, (12, 14, 5)>, <13, (3, 6, 13)>, <13, (4, 6, 8)>, <13, (8, 12, 13)>, <5, (8, 12, 5)>, <6, (3, 6, 13)>, <6, (8, 11, 6)>, <4, (1, 13, 4)>, <4, (7, 9, 4)>, <7, (1, 7, 3)>, <7, (9, 11, 7)>, <7, (8, 14, 7)>, <0, (9, 11, 0)>, <0, (11, 12, 0)>, <11, (6, 8, 11)>, <11, (7, 9, 11)>, <11, (0, 12, 11)>, <14, (7, 8, 14)>,...
