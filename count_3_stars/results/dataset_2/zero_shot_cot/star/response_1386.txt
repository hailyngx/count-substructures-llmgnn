Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 16) (15, 13) (15, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (18, 16) (18, 17) (16, 15) (16, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 17) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (19, 7) (19, 0) (9, 0) (14, 10) (14, 5) (14, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 9) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 18) (17, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-stars based on the given information.
Since a 3-star has a center node connected to exactly three other nodes, we can look for nodes that have exactly three edges connected to them.

Identifying these nodes:
- Node 4 has 4 edges (with nodes 7, 12, 13, 17).
- Node 13 has 5 edges (with nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 15).
- Node 15 has 4 edges (with nodes 13, 16, 17, 3).
- Node 12 has 4 edges (with nodes 2, 4, 5, 17).
- Node 0 has 4 edges (with nodes 1, 5, 9, 19).
- Node 14 has 4 edges (with nodes 1, 5, 10, 2).
- Node 7 has 4 edges (with nodes 2, 4, 8, 19).

Based on the above observations, we can see that nodes 4, 12, and 13 are part of 3-stars.

Now, let's count the unique 3-stars:
<4, (7, 12, 17)>
<12, (2, 4, 17)>
<13, (1, 3, 15)>

Therefore, there are a total of 3 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [3].
