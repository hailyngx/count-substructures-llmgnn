Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (10, 8) (10, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
First, let's identify the 3-star configurations in the given graph: 

1. Node 1: (1, 6), (1, 11), (1, 5)		<1, (6, 11, 5)>
2. Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 13), (3, 9)		<3, (0, 13, 9)>
3. Node 4: (4, 12), (4, 5), (4, 14)		<4, (12, 5, 14)>
4. Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6)		<5, (1, 4, 6)>
5. Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 10)		<6, (1, 5, 10)>
6. Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 13), (8, 2)		<8, (3, 13, 2)>
7. Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 13), (9, 0)		<9, (3, 13, 0)>
8. Node 11: (11, 1), (11, 8), (11, 13)	<11, (1, 8, 13)>
9. Node 12: (12, 4), (12, 6), (12, 14)	<12, (4, 6, 14)>
10. Node 14: (14, 4), (14, 7), (14, 12)	<14, (4, 7, 12)>

Now, we count the total number of 3-star configurations: 
[10]
