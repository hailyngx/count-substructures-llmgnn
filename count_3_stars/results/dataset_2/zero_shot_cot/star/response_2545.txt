Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph. 

First, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 5:
- Node 2, Node 0, Node 7, and Node 14 are connected to Node 5.

Next, let's identify all the nodes that are connected to node 6:
- Node 9, Node 1, Node 14, and Node 12 are connected to Node 6.

Now we need to identify all the nodes that are connected to node 1:
- Node 6, Node 10, and Node 13 are connected to Node 1.

Then, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 9:
- Node 6, Node 2, and Node 3 are connected to Node 9.

Next, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 3:
- Node 9, Node 7, and Node 12 are connected to Node 3.

Now, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 8:
- Node 4, Node 11, Node 0, and Node 14 are connected to Node 8.

Then, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 13:
- Node 1, Node 11, Node 10, and Node 0 are connected to Node 13.

Let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 4:
- Node 8, Node 10, and Node 14 are connected to Node 4.

Next, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 11:
- Node 8, Node 13, Node 7, and Node 12 are connected to Node 11.

Now, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 0:
- Node 5, Node 8, Node 13, Node 7, and Node 2 are connected to Node 0.

Then, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 7:
- Node 5, Node 3, Node 11, Node 0 are connected to Node 7.

Next, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 2:
- Node 5, Node 9, Node 0, Node 10, and Node 14 are connected to Node 2.

Now, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 12:
- Node 6, Node 3, and Node 11 are connected to Node 12.

Lastly, let's find all the nodes that are connected to node 14:
- Node 5, Node 6, Node 4, Node 2, and Node 10 are connected to Node 14.

Therefore, we have a total of four 3-stars in the given graph. 
So, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (2, 0, 7)>
<6, (9, 1, 14)>
<1, (6, 10, 13)>
<4, (8, 10, 14)>
