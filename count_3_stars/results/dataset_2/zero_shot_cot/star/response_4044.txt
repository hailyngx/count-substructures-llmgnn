Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 24) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 13) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 1) (21, 16) (21, 14) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 0) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 29) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 14) (0, 12) (20, 0) (20, 2) (1, 7) (1, 22) (1, 16) (26, 22) (26, 8) (5, 17) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 27) (14, 21) (14, 0) (16, 3) (16, 21) (16, 1) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 25) (8, 3) (8, 26) (8, 19) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 2) (19, 6) (19, 8) (19, 25) (17, 5) (17, 25) (17, 12) (17, 27) (17, 11) (25, 10) (25, 19) (25, 17) (25, 4) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 29) (13, 15) (13, 27) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 29) (4, 10) (4, 9) (4, 25) (4, 2) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (12, 0) (12, 17) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 17) (27, 13) (29, 23) (29, 18) (29, 24) (29, 11) (11, 6) (11, 17) (11, 29) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star pattern. 
Looking at the given edges, we can see that the nodes that fit this pattern are nodes: 17, 22, 24, 25, and 29.
Now, let's find all unique 3-star patterns involving these central nodes:

<17, (5, 25, 27)>
<22, (0, 1, 26)>
<24, (3, 12, 29)>
<25, (4, 10, 17)>
<29, (11, 18, 24)>

Since these patterns are unique, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
