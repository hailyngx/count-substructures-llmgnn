Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
The given graph contains the following 3-stars:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (3, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, there are [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
