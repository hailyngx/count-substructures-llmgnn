Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in the given graph are:
<4, (7, 2, 6)>
<7, (4, 0, 1)>
<1, (7, 0, 9)>
<3, (6, 9, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (7, 3, 2)>
<0, (7, 1, 2)>
<9, (4, 7, 1)>
