Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 11) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (27, 22) (27, 7) (27, 16) (27, 5) (8, 0) (8, 11) (13, 18) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 23) (28, 15) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 14) (29, 16) (29, 21) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (26, 1) (26, 19) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 22) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 10) (22, 27) (22, 6) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 24) (5, 27) (5, 19) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 20) (23, 0) (23, 12) (23, 11) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 4) (10, 24) (21, 29) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 14) (16, 27) (16, 29) (16, 21) (14, 28) (14, 1) (14, 21) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 17) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (24, 7) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 20) (25, 2) (4, 10) (4, 20) (17, 2) (20, 9) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 4) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars, we need to identify all instances where a node is connected to exactly three other nodes, forming a 3-star structure.

Let's start by listing down the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

1. <0, (12, 8, 23)>
2. <1, (26, 6, 14)>
3. <2, (20, 17, 25)>
4. <4, (20, 10, 10)> (Note: Node 10 appears twice in this star)
5. <5, (27, 19, 5)>
6. <7, (28, 12, 24)>
7. <9, (15, 20, 10)>
8. <10, (21, 4, 24)>
9. <11, (23, 18, 20)>
10. <14, (1, 28, 21)>
11. <15, (9, 11, 15)>
12. <16, (21, 29, 27)>
13. <18, (11, 13, 0)>
14. <19, (24, 5, 26)>
15. <20, (11, 2, 24)>
16. <21, (16, 14, 29)>
17. <22, (6, 27, 22)>
18. <23, (11, 0, 12)>
19. <24, (20, 10, 4)>
20. <25, (17, 2, 2)>
21. <26, (5, 1, 19)>
22. <27, (16, 5, 22)>
23. <28, (14, 7, 6)>
24. <29, (21, 16, 21)>

Now, count the total number of unique 3-stars found in the graph. So, the final answer is [24].
