Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of [5] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 12, 13)>
<7, (1, 9, 14)>
<1, (2, 10, 13)>
<3, (0, 9, 13)>
<6, (9, 12, 14)>
