Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify nodes that are part of a 3-star pattern.
In a 3-star graph, the center node is connected to exactly three other nodes. Let's identify the 3-stars in the graph:

<1, (9, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 4, 0)>
<3, (9, 1, 6)>
<4, (9, 3, 6)>

Now, we count the number of unique 3-stars found, which is 4. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
