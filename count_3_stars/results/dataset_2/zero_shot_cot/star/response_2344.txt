Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 9) (1, 27) (21, 1) (21, 18) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 19) (7, 27) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 20) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 15) (23, 24) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 2) (20, 22) (20, 0) (20, 13) (26, 28) (26, 5) (26, 12) (26, 17) (28, 0) (28, 26) (28, 9) (28, 13) (15, 22) (15, 23) (15, 18) (11, 23) (11, 19) (25, 24) (27, 1) (27, 7) (5, 23) (5, 26) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 17) (6, 24) (6, 10) (6, 3) (24, 7) (24, 23) (24, 25) (24, 6) (17, 26) (17, 5) (12, 26) (12, 5) (12, 16) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 19) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (19, 7) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 29) (9, 1) (9, 28) (9, 2) (29, 14) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (18, 21) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 8) (13, 20) (13, 28) (13, 19) (13, 10) (8, 12) (8, 18) 

Response:
We can identify the 3-stars in the graph by looking for nodes that have exactly three neighbors. Let's go step-by-step:

1. Identify nodes with exactly three neighbors:
- Node 7 has neighbors (4, 24, 19)
- Node 23 has neighbors (22, 11, 15)
- Node 26 has neighbors (28, 5, 17)
- Node 28 has neighbors (0, 26, 13)
- Node 15 has neighbors (22, 23, 18)
- Node 12 has neighbors (26, 5, 16)
- Node 16 has neighbors (12, 19, 8)
- Node 3 has neighbors (6, 14, 2)
- Node 6 has neighbors (24, 10, 3)
- Node 13 has neighbors (20, 28, 19)
- Node 14 has neighbors (3, 2, 29)
- Node 9 has neighbors (1, 28, 2)
- Node 10 has neighbors (6, 13, 0)
- Node 18 has neighbors (21, 15, 5)
- Node 19 has neighbors (7, 11, 16)

2. List the unique 3-stars found:
- <7, (4, 24, 19)>
- <23, (22, 11, 15)>
- <26, (28, 5, 17)>
- <28, (0, 26, 13)>
- <15, (22, 23, 18)>
- <12, (26, 5, 16)>
- <16, (12, 19, 8)>
- <3, (6, 14, 2)>
- <6, (24, 10, 3)>
- <13, (20, 28, 19)>
- <14, (3, 2, 29)>
- <9, (1, 28, 2)>
- <10, (6, 13, 0)>
- <18, (21, 15, 5)>
- <19, (7, 11, 16)>

Count the total number of 3-stars: [15]
