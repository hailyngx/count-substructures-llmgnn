Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
Let's go step-by-step to find the number of 3-stars in the given graph:

1. **Identify the central nodes**: Look for nodes with exactly 3 edges connected to them.

- The nodes that fulfill this condition are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 13, and 14.

2. **Find the leaves connected to each central node**: For each central node found in the previous step, list the nodes connected to it.

- For central node 0: (6, 1, 3, 13, 5, 11)
- For central node 1: (3, 5, 0, 7)
- For central node 2: (3, 8, 5, 14, 7)
- For central node 3: (1, 7, 0, 13, 2)
- For central node 4: (6, 13, 10, 11)
- For central node 5: (6, 1, 10, 2, 0)
- For central node 7: (9, 1, 3, 10, 2, 14)
- For central node 13: (8, 0, 3, 4)

3. **Count the number of unique 3-stars**: 

Counting the number of unique 3-stars, we find: 7.

4. **List the unique 3-stars**:

- <0, (6, 1, 5)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 8, 14)>
- <3, (1, 7, 0)>
- <4, (6, 13, 10)>
- <5, (6, 1, 2)>
- <13, (8, 0, 3)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
