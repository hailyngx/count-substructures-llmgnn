Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
There are total 4 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 
Therefore, the answer is [4].

Unique 3-stars:
<6, (9, 3, 8)>
<1, (9, 3, 2)>
<3, (6, 1, 7)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
