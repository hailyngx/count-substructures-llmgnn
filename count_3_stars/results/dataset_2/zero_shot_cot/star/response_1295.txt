Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center with exactly three edges, forming a 3-star.

Based on the given edges, we can identify the 3-stars as follows:
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <8, (0, 2, 1)>
- <6, (0, 3, 4)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <0, (3, 6, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>

Counting all the unique 3-stars identified, we have a total of [9] 3-stars.
