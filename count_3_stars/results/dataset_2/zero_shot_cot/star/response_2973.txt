Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 24) (26, 9) (26, 21) (26, 16) (26, 4) (26, 17) (1, 21) (1, 3) (1, 25) (21, 9) (21, 26) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 6) (17, 26) (17, 13) (17, 28) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 27) (2, 29) (2, 23) (2, 28) (2, 25) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 13) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 27) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 15) (23, 2) (23, 8) (4, 26) (4, 22) (4, 24) (15, 8) (15, 18) (20, 25) (20, 27) (20, 22) (25, 1) (25, 2) (25, 20) (25, 11) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 25) (28, 17) (28, 2) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 17) (13, 29) (13, 5) (6, 21) (6, 16) (6, 27) (12, 3) (16, 26) (16, 6) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 24) (22, 4) (22, 20) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 10) (18, 15) (18, 10) (27, 7) (27, 3) (27, 20) (27, 6) (27, 19) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 27) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. From the given edge list, we can check for each node if it is connected to exactly three other nodes. 
2. If a node has three neighbors and those neighbors are not connected to each other, then it forms a 3-star.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph:

<9, (26, 21, 11)>
<26, (9, 21, 16)>
<1, (21, 3, 25)>
<21, (9, 26, 1)>
<17, (26, 13, 28)>
<7, (21, 11, 27)>
<2, (29, 23, 28)>
<3, (1, 12, 27)>
<8, (23, 24, 15)>
<4, (26, 22, 24)>
<15, (8, 18, 10)>
<20, (25, 27, 22)>
<5, (13, 10, 5)>
<6, (21, 16, 27)>
<0, (2, 10, 19)>
<10, (5, 0, 18)>
<22, (4, 20, 27)>
<24, (9, 8, 4)>
<18, (15, 10, 0)>
<19, (0, 10, 27)>

Therefore, there are [20] 3-stars in the given graph.
