Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 15) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 21) (10, 8) (10, 25) (8, 11) (8, 10) (8, 23) (8, 25) (23, 8) (23, 21) (23, 27) (23, 12) (0, 20) (0, 29) (0, 25) (0, 26) (20, 1) (20, 0) (20, 27) (9, 3) (9, 24) (22, 1) (22, 21) (24, 9) (24, 15) (26, 0) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 12) (13, 26) (13, 4) (13, 7) (18, 16) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 17) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 27) (25, 10) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 19) (21, 10) (21, 23) (21, 22) (21, 27) (21, 4) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 18) (5, 2) (5, 28) (6, 14) (6, 19) (17, 18) (14, 2) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 4) (15, 16) (15, 24) (15, 7) (27, 23) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 21) (29, 0) (28, 5) (28, 14) (28, 4) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 14) (4, 28) (19, 3) (19, 25) (19, 6) (12, 23) (12, 26) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to the center node with exactly three edges. These nodes will form the leaves of the 3-star graphs.

From the given edges, we can identify the nodes connected to each other node as follows:

- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 20, and 22.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 9, and 19.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 11, 10, and 23.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 26, 4, and 7.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 28.
- Node 16 is connected to nodes 11, 18, and 15.
- Node 18 is connected to nodes 16, 26, and 5.
- Node 21 is connected to nodes 10, 23, and 22.
- Node 25 is connected to nodes 10, 8, and 19.
- Node 27 is connected to nodes 23, 20, and 7.

Now, let's count the number of unique 3-stars in the graph based on the identified leaves.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 20, 22)>
<3, (1, 9, 19)>
<8, (11, 10, 23)>
<13, (26, 4, 7)>
<14, (2, 6, 28)>
<16, (11, 18, 15)>
<18, (16, 26, 5)>
<21, (10, 23, 22)>
<25, (10, 8, 19)>
<27, (23, 20, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
