Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 9) (15, 16) (15, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (9, 3) (9, 4) (18, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated from the total number of occurrences of each node in all edges. 

Here are the occurrences of each node in the provided edges:

- Node 0: 4 occurrences
- Node 1: 3 occurrences
- Node 2: 3 occurrences
- Node 3: 3 occurrences
- Node 4: 3 occurrences
- Node 5: 3 occurrences
- Node 6: 3 occurrences
- Node 7: 3 occurrences
- Node 8: 3 occurrences
- Node 9: 2 occurrences
- Node 10: 2 occurrences
- Node 11: 2 occurrences
- Node 12: 3 occurrences
- Node 13: 3 occurrences
- Node 14: 2 occurrences
- Node 15: 2 occurrences
- Node 16: 2 occurrences
- Node 17: 4 occurrences
- Node 18: 2 occurrences
- Node 19: 3 occurrences

To form a 3-star, the center node must have exactly three edges connecting it to three other nodes.

Based on the occurrences above, the possible 3-stars are as follows:

<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (10, 13, 17)>
<3, (8, 13, 19)>
<4, (1, 9, 12)>
<7, (13, 14, 17)>
<8, (1, 8, 19)>
<12, (4, 16, 18)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].
