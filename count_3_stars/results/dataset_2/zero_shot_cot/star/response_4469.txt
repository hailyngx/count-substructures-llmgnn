Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 10) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 14) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph step-by-step:

1. First, let's list all nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 10, 11, and 8.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 0.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 11, and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 1, and 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 12, and 11.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 6.
- Node 11 is connected to nodes 6, 3, and 14.
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 9, 7, and 2.
- Node 10 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 5.
- Node 14 is connected to nodes 2, 11, and 13.
- Node 13 is connected to nodes 9, 11, and 14.

2. Now, we can form the unique 3-stars:
<6, (10, 11, 8)>
<9, (10, 13, 0)>
<1, (3, 5, 4)>
<3, (1, 11, 5)>
<5, (1, 12, 11)>
<8, (2, 7, 6)>
<11, (6, 3, 14)>
<0, (9, 7, 2)>
<10, (6, 9, 5)>
<14, (2, 11, 13)>
<13, (9, 11, 14)>

[There are 11 unique 3-stars in the given graph.]
