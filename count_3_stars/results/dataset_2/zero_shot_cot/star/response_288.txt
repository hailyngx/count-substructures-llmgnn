Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we need to identify all the unique instances of a central node connected to exactly three other nodes. Here are the 3-stars found in the given graph:

<0, (9, 2, 1)>
<1, (4, 0, 7)>
<2, (6, 0, 7)>
<3, (5, 9, 6)>
<4, (6, 1, 8)>
<5, (9, 8, 3)>
<6, (9, 4, 2)>
<7, (9, 8, 1)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (5, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10].
