Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 6) (17, 3) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (11, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (2, 17) (5, 10) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 16) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 16) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 8) (15, 11) (15, 19) (15, 12) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 13) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 7) (18, 5) (18, 13) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 18) (13, 6) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify sets of nodes where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes and the three leaf nodes are not directly connected to each other.

Let's determine the 3-stars and count them:

1. For node 1: (1, 3, 9, 7)
   
2. For node 3: (3, 17, 1, 4)
   
3. For node 5: (5, 10, 0, 19)
   
4. For node 8: (8, 10, 0, 9)
   
5. For node 9: (9, 17, 1, 8)
   
6. For node 10: (10, 11, 8, 5)
   
7. For node 11: (11, 14, 15, 4)
   
8. For node 13: (13, 0, 18, 7)

Therefore, there are 8 unique 3-stars in the given graph. 

So, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].
