Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 5) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 15) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 17) (5, 14) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 9) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 9) (4, 12) (4, 16) (4, 6) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 14) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 15) (15, 2) (15, 14) (18, 13) (18, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 0) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 16) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with exactly three edges. These nodes are: 1, 4, 7, 11, 16, and 18.
Now, let's check each of these nodes to see if they form a 3-star.

1. For node 1:
   - Edges: (1, 10), (1, 19), (1, 9)
   - No 3-star centered at node 1.

2. For node 4:
   - Edges: (4, 12), (4, 16), (4, 6)
   - No 3-star centered at node 4.

3. For node 7:
   - Edges: (7, 11), (7, 19)
   - No 3-star centered at node 7.

4. For node 11:
   - Edges: (11, 7), (11, 3)
   - No 3-star centered at node 11.

5. For node 16:
   - Edges: (16, 0), (16, 4), (16, 9)
   - No 3-star centered at node 16.

6. For node 18:
   - Edges: (18, 13), (18, 10), (18, 1)
   - <18, (13, 10, 1)>.

Therefore, there is only one 3-star in the given graph, which is <18, (13, 10, 1)>.
The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1].
