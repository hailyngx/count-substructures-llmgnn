Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 19) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 5) (15, 25) (27, 12) (27, 7) (27, 8) (9, 29) (9, 18) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 16) (17, 10) (12, 27) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 25) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 1) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 25) (21, 28) (21, 5) (21, 2) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 21) (28, 11) (11, 14) (11, 28) (11, 1) (11, 26) (11, 20) (26, 11) (26, 29) (20, 11) (20, 4) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 8) (29, 4) (4, 22) (4, 12) (4, 20) (4, 29) (4, 16) (3, 2) (23, 18) (23, 24) (18, 9) (18, 23) (18, 1) (18, 8) (19, 13) (19, 16) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 18) (1, 24) (8, 27) (8, 29) (8, 18) (8, 24) (24, 23) (24, 1) (24, 8) (24, 2) (2, 10) (2, 21) (2, 3) (2, 24) (25, 13) (25, 15) (25, 12) (25, 14) (16, 10) (16, 4) (16, 19) (5, 22) (5, 10) (5, 21) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify all instances where one node is connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<2, (10, 21, 24)>
<4, (12, 20, 29)>
<5, (10, 21, 22)>
<7, (1, 12, 14)>
<8, (18, 24, 29)>
<11, (1, 14, 20)>
<13, (19, 22, 25)>
<14, (7, 11, 25)>
<16, (10, 19, 4)>
<18, (8, 9, 23)>
<21, (2, 5, 28)>
<22, (13, 4, 5)>
<24, (1, 2, 8)>
<25, (12, 13, 14)>
<27, (7, 12, 8)>
<28, (11, 14, 21)>
<29, (4, 8, 26)>
<10, (2, 5, 16)>
<19, (13, 16, 4)>
<1, (7, 11, 24)>
<9, (18, 29, 23)>
<3, (2, 24, 23)>

Based on the identified 3-stars, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
