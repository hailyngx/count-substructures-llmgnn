Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 7) (25, 9) (25, 26) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 29) (17, 10) (17, 13) (17, 8) (12, 20) (12, 27) (12, 13) (12, 21) (27, 20) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 2) (27, 6) (28, 29) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 18) (28, 23) (29, 10) (29, 27) (29, 28) (29, 26) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 27) (2, 0) (21, 12) (21, 28) (21, 15) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 19) (26, 25) (26, 29) (26, 13) (26, 18) (18, 28) (18, 26) (18, 1) (8, 17) (8, 28) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 3) (9, 25) (9, 8) (15, 21) (16, 22) (16, 6) (7, 25) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (22, 16) (22, 4) (4, 0) (4, 22) (4, 24) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 19) (24, 8) (24, 4) (11, 6) (19, 20) (19, 13) (19, 3) (6, 27) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 14) (14, 6) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 23) (5, 7) (23, 28) (23, 1) 

Response:
Let's count the number of 3-stars in the given graph.

To form a 3-star in the graph, we need a central node connected to exactly three other nodes by edges. Let's identify all the 3-stars in the graph:

1. Node 20 is the central node: <20, (25, 12, 27)>
2. Node 25 is the central node: <25, (20, 7, 9)>
3. Node 10 is the central node: <10, (17, 7, 1)>
4. Node 17 is the central node: <17, (10, 13, 8)>
5. Node 12 is the central node: <12, (20, 27, 13)>
6. Node 27 is the central node: <27, (20, 12, 29)>
7. Node 28 is the central node: <28, (29, 21, 8)>
8. Node 29 is the central node: <29, (10, 27, 28)>
9. Node 2 is the central node: <2, (27, 0, -)>
10. Node 21 is the central node: <21, (12, 28, 15)>
11. Node 13 is the central node: <13, (17, 12, 26)>
12. Node 26 is the central node: <26, (25, 29, 13)>
13. Node 18 is the central node: <18, (28, 26, 1)>
14. Node 8 is the central node: <8, (17, 28, 9)>
15. Node 7 is the central node: <7, (25, 10, 3)>
16. Node 22 is the central node: <22, (16, 4, -)>
17. Node 4 is the central node: <4, (0, 22, 24)>
18. Node 6 is the central node: <6, (27, 16, 11)>
19. Node 1 is the central node: <1, (10, 18, 23)>

There are 19 unique 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].
