Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the graph, we first identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes. These nodes will be the centers of our potential 3-stars.

1. Identify nodes with three connections:
- Node 2: Connected to nodes 1, 3, 4
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 2, 6, 8
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 1, 6, 8

2. Count the number of 3-stars for each identified center:
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 3, and 4
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with leaves 2, 6, and 8
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with leaves 3, 4, and 7
- Node 7 forms a 3-star with leaves 1, 6, and 8

Putting it all together, we find that there are 4 unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 8)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
