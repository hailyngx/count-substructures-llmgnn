Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
- First, let's find nodes that are connected to exactly three nodes. These nodes will be the centers of the 3-stars.
- Nodes with exactly three edges:  
Node 8 is connected to 2, 7, 1  
Node 4 is connected to 2, 0, 6  
Node 2 is connected to 4, 8, 1  
Node 3 is connected to 9, 6, 7  
- Next, for each of these nodes, identify the adjacent nodes that are connected to them. These adjacent nodes are the leaves of the 3-stars.
- For node 8: (2, 7, 1)  
<8,(2, 7, 1)>
- For node 4: (2, 0, 6)  
<4,(2, 0, 6)>
- For node 2: (4, 8, 1)  
<2,(4, 8, 1)>
- For node 3: (9, 6, 7)  
<3,(9, 6, 7)>
- Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
