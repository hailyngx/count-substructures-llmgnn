Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 0) (3, 15) (3, 22) (15, 1) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 17) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 21) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 26) (20, 13) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 9) (28, 12) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 23) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 6) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 8) (17, 15) (17, 11) (6, 11) (6, 22) (6, 12) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 22) (19, 5) (19, 7) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 27) (25, 29) (25, 27) (25, 12) (27, 2) (27, 25) (27, 14) (27, 23) (8, 10) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 7) (7, 19) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 18) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 28) (24, 1) (16, 29) (16, 5) (18, 7) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 2) (23, 27) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 12) (13, 0) (13, 20) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 25) (12, 14) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes that are connected to each node:

Node 0: 21, 26, 13
Node 1: 21, 15, 24, 23
Node 2: 22, 23, 27
Node 3: 15, 22
Node 5: 10, 19, 16
Node 6: 11, 22, 12
Node 7: 8, 19, 14, 18
Node 8: 10, 28, 26, 7
Node 9: 15, 10, 28
Node 10: 11, 8, 9, 5
Node 11: 10, 6, 17
Node 12: 28, 6, 25, 14
Node 13: 0, 20
Node 14: 27, 7, 12
Node 15: 1, 3, 9, 29, 17
Node 16: 29, 5
Node 17: 15, 11
Node 18: 7
Node 19: 22, 5, 7
Node 20: 26, 13
Node 21: 1, 28, 0
Node 22: 3, 2, 19, 6
Node 23: 1, 29, 2, 27
Node 24: 1
Node 25: 29, 27, 12
Node 26: 0, 20, 8
Node 27: 2, 25, 23, 14
Node 28: 21, 8, 9, 12
Node 29: 15, 16, 25, 23

Now let's identify the 3-stars:

<1, (21, 15, 24)>
<1, (21, 15, 23)>
<1, (15, 3, 9)>
<15, (1, 3, 9)>
<15, (1, 29, 17)>
<15, (29, 16, 5)>
<10, (11, 6, 17)>
<28, (21, 0, 26)>
<28, (21, 0, 13)>
<28, (9, 10, 8)>
<28, (9, 10, 7)>
<9, (15, 10, 28)>
<28, (12, 6, 25)>
<0, (21, 26, 13)>
<7, (19, 5, 16)>
<2, (22, 19, 5)>
<2, (22, 6, 12)>
<5, (16, 29, 25)>
<27, (23, 2, 14)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
