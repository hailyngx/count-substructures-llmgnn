Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify all the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <0, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <1, (0, 4, 7)>
3. <2, (4, 6, 8)>
4. <3, (0, 6, 8)>
5. <4, (1, 2, 6)>
6. <5, (7, 8, 9)>
7. <6, (0, 3, 4)>
8. <7, (1, 5, 8)>
9. <8, (2, 3, 5)>
10. <9, (2, 5, 7)>

There are a total of [10] 3-stars in the given graph.
