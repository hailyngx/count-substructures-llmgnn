Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that are part of each 3-star:

1. Node 0: (0, 9), (0, 7), (0, 3), (0, 1)
2. Node 1: (1, 9), (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 8), (1, 0)
3. Node 2: (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 1)
4. Node 3: (3, 9), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 0)
5. Node 4: (4, 7), (4, 1), (4, 6), (4, 2)
6. Node 5: (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 7)
7. Node 6: (6, 4), (6, 2)
8. Node 7: (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 0), (7, 3)
9. Node 8: (8, 5), (8, 9), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 1)
10. Node 9: (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0)

Next, let's count the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (9, 7, 3)>, <0, (9, 7, 1)>
- Node 1: <1, (9, 4, 2)>, <1, (9, 4, 8)>, <1, (9, 4, 0)>, <1, (4, 2, 6)>, <1, (4, 2, 8)>
- Node 2: <2, (5, 4, 6)>, <2, (5, 4, 8)>, <2, (5, 8, 3)>, <2, (4, 6, 2)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>
- Node 3: <3, (9, 7, 0)>
- Node 4: <4, (7, 5, 2)>, <4, (7, 5, 8)>, <4, (7, 5, 0)>, <4, (5, 2, 6)>, <4, (5, 2, 8)>
- Node 5: <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- Node 6: <6, (4, 2, 8)>
- Node 7: <7, (5, 4, 0)>, <7, (5, 4, 8)>
- Node 8: <8, (5, 2, 4)>, <8, (5, 2, 6)>
- Node 9: <9, (1, 4, 2)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 0)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [14].
