Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) 

Response:
To count the number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first identify the central node and its adjacent nodes. 
In this case, the central node is:
- Node 4, with adjacent nodes 8, 9, 0, 3, 5, and 6.

Next, we find all the 3-stars in the graph by considering each possible combination of nodes around the central node. 

The 3-stars in the graph are:
<4, (8, 9, 0)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<9, (4, 0, 2)>

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [4].
