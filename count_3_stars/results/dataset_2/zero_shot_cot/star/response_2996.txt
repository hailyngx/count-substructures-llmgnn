Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) 

Response:
Let's identify the 3-stars in the given graph:

1. <2, (1, 3, 6)>
2. <3, (4, 5, 12)>
3. <4, (0, 11, 14)>
4. <5, (7, 14, 3)>
5. <6, (2, 13, 9)>
6. <7, (5, 8, 14)>
7. <8, (7, 11, 14)>
8. <9, (6, 13, 11)>
9. <10, (0, 14, 2)>
10. <11, (9, 4, 8)>
11. <12, (3, 1, 7)>
12. <13, (0, 6, 7)>
13. <14, (5, 11, 7)>
14. <0, (10, 13, 4)>

Therefore, there are [14] 3-stars in total in the given graph.
