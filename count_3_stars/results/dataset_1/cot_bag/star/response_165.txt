Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, and 9. 

For node 0, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

For node 1, we have inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

For node 4, we have inom{7}{3} = 35 3-stars.

For node 6, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For node 9, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 20 + 35 + 4 + 1] = 70.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 9)>.
