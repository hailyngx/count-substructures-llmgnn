Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 5
- Node 1: 0, 3
- Node 2: 0, 6
- Node 3: 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 7: 9
- Node 8: 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 6, 7, 8

Let's now find the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

For each node with at least three neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors as well, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
Node 8 also has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 18 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 1, 3>
<3, 5, 6>
<3, 5, 8>
<3, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 8>
<6, 8, 9>
