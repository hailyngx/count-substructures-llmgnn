Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

By applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the nodes with three or more neighbors, we can calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Putting these together, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \) 3-stars. Therefore, the final result is [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 3, 9)>
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 8)>
