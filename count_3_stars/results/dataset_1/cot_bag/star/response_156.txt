Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 7
- 1 is connected to 0, 8
- 2 is connected to 6
- 3 is connected to 0, 4, 8, 9
- 4 is connected to 0, 3, 5
- 5 is connected to 4, 6
- 6 is connected to 2, 5
- 7 is connected to 0
- 8 is connected to 1, 3, 9
- 9 is connected to 3, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars. 

Node 0 forms 3-stars with the following sets of neighbors: 
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
There are 3 3-stars with node 0.

Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 8)>

Node 3 forms 2 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>

Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 5)>

Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
