Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 2, 7, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Node 9: 1, 4, 6, 7

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 25 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [25].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 1, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <9, (1, 4, 6)>, <9, (1, 6, 7)>.
