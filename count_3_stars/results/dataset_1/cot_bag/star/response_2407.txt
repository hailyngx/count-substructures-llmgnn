Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9.

For node 0:
There are 4 nodes connected to node 0, forming 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
<0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (8, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>

For node 2:
There are 3 nodes connected to node 2, forming 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<2, (1, 9, 5)>

For node 4:
There are 3 nodes connected to node 4, forming 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<4, (0, 8, 7)>

For node 5:
There are 3 nodes connected to node 5, forming 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<5, (2, 3, 7)>

For node 9:
There are 5 nodes connected to node 9, forming 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
<9, (0, 1, 6)>, <9, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 6, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].
