Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 2
- Node 1: 0, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 7: 2, 8
- Node 8: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

Now, we'll determine the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 forms 3-stars with (0, 2, 4), (6, 3, 9), (9, 5, 8), and (1, 6, 9) = 4 3-stars
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with (0, 1, 6) and (4, 5, 8) = 2 3-stars
- Node 3 forms 3-stars with (8, 5, 6) = 1 3-star
- Node 4 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with (4, 2, 6) = 1 3-star
- Node 6 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 8 does not form any 3-stars
- Node 9 does not form any 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 2 + 1 + 1] = 8,
and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (6, 3, 9)>, <1, (9, 5, 8)>, <1, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (8, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 2, 6)>.
