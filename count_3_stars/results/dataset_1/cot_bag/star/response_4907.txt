Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: {4}
- Node 1: {5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: {6, 8}
- Node 4: {0}
- Node 5: {1, 7, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 2}
- Node 7: {5}
- Node 8: {2}
- Node 9: {1, 5}

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-star (less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
