Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 0 = 36 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [36].

The unique 3-stars found are:
