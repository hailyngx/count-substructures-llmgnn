Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by those nodes.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 5.
2. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, and 8.
3. Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
4. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 7.
5. Node 5 has 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 8.
6. Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
7. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, and 9.
8. Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

1. Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
2. Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
3. Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
4. Node 5 can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
5. Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 35 + 4] = [42] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (0, 8, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (8, 8, 9)>
