Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
By analyzing the provided edges, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Edges: (0 - 3, 5, 6, 9), (1 - 2, 3, 4, 7), (2 - 1, 5, 6, 8), (3 - 0, 1, 5, 6, 7), (4 - 1, 9), (5 - 0, 2, 3, 9), (6 - 0, 2, 3, 9), (7 - 1, 3, 9), (8 - 2), (9 - 0, 4, 5, 6, 7)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed around those nodes.

For node 0: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center: 
   - <0, 3, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 6, 9>, <0, 5, 6, 9>

For node 1: 
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 7.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center: 
   - <1, 2, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 4, 7>

For node 2: 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center: 
   - <2, 1, 5, 6>, <2, 1, 5, 8>, <2, 1, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 6, 8>

For node 3: 
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 6, and 7.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 3 as the center: 
   - <3, 0, 1, 5>, <3, 0, 1, 6>, <3, 0, 1, 7>, <3, 0, 5, 6>, <3, 0, 5, 9>, 
     <3, 0, 6, 9>, <3, 1, 5, 7>, <3, 1, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6, 7>

For node 5: 
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 5 as the center: 
   - <5, 0, 2, 3>, <5, 0, 3, 9>, <5, 0, 2, 9>, <5, 2, 3, 9>

For node 6: 
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 6 as the center: 
   - <6, 0, 2, 3>, <6, 0, 3, 9>, <6, 0, 2, 9>, <6, 2, 3, 9>

For node 9: 
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 9 as the center: 
   - <9, 0, 4, 5>, <9, 0, 5, 6>, <9, 0, 4, 6>, <9, 0, 4, 7>, <9, 5, 6, 7>, 
     <9, 5, 6, 0>, <9, 5, 0, 4>, <9, 6, 7, 0>, <9, 6, 7, 1>, <9, 6, 0, 1>

There are 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 40 3-stars in total.
Therefore, the final answer is [40]. 
And the unique 3-stars are <0, 3, 5, 6>, <0, 3, 5, 9>, <0, 3, 6, 9>, <0, 5, 6, 9>, <1, 2, 3, 4>, <1, 2, 3, 7>, <1, 3, 4, 7>, <1, 2, 4, 7>, <2, 1, 5, 6>, <2, 1, 5, 8>, <2, 1, 6, 8>, <2, 5, 6, 8>, <3, 0, 1, 5>, <3, 0, 1, 6>, <3, 0, 1, 7>, <3, 0, 5, 6>, <3, 0, 5, 9>, <3, 0, 6, 9>, <3, 1, 5, 7>, <3, 1, 6, 7>, <3, 5, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 6, 7>, <5, 0, 2, 3>, <5, 0, 3, 9>, <5, 0, 2, 9>, <5, 2, 3, 9>, <6, 0, 2, 3>, <6, 0, 3, 9>, <6, 0, 2, 9>, <6, 2, 3, 9>, <9, 0, 4, 5>, <9, 0, 5, 6>, <9, 0, 4, 6>, <9, 0, 4, 7>, <9, 5, 6, 7>, <9, 5, 6, 0>, <9, 5, 0, 4>, <9, 6, 7, 0>, <9, 6, 7, 1>, <9, 6, 0, 1>.
