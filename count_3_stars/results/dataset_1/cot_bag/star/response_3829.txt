Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors, as these are the potential central nodes for 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 6): forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 5, 9): forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 (neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9): forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 (neighbors: 2, 4, 5): forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 (neighbors: 2, 3, 6): forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 (neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8): forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 4, 7): forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 (neighbors: 2, 5, 9): forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 (neighbors: 1, 2, 8): forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 10 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
