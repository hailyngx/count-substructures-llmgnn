Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the edges provided, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes numbered from 0 to 9. The edges are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3 and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 6.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 2:
- <2, (5, 9, 6)>
- <2, (5, 9, 3)>

For Node 3:
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (8, 9, 5)>
- <3, (8, 9, 6)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
