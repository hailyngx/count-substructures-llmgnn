Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the unique 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
  The unique 3-stars for node 0 are <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>.

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7. There is 1 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 3, 7)>.

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8. So there are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 3 as the center. 
  The unique 3-stars for node 3 are <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>.

- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, 9. There is 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (3, 7, 9)>.

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 6. There is 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (0, 1, 6)>.

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 9. There is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center: <8, (2, 3, 9)>.

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 8. There is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (0, 6, 8)>.

So the total number of 3-stars is [10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 25. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].
