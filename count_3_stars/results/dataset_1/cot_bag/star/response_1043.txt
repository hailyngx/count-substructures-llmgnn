Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
0: {4, 8}
1: {6, 8, 9}
2: {4, 7, 8}
3: {5, 8, 9}
4: {0, 2, 7}
5: {3, 6}
6: {1, 5, 7, 8, 9}
7: {2, 4, 6, 9}
8: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6}
9: {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = \( 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 31 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 6, 8)>
<7, (2, 7, 4)>
<7, (2, 7, 6)>
<8, (3, 8, 0)>
<8, (3, 8, 1)>
<8, (3, 8, 6)>
<8, (3, 8, 2)>
<8, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 9, 1)>
<9, (3, 9, 6)>
