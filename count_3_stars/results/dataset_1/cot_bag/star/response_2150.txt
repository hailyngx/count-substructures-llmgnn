Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph based on the given edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 1 and 7
- 1 is connected to 0, 7, and 8
- 3 is connected to 9
- 6 is connected to 8 and 9
- 7 is connected to 0, 1
- 8 is connected to 1 and 6
- 9 is connected to 3 and 6

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

So, we can form 1 3-star with node 1 (as it has 3 neighbors). Now, we need to calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with the other nodes.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 1) + \( \binom{3}{3} \) (from node 3) + \( \binom{6}{3} \) (from nodes 6, 7, 8, 9) 

= 1 + 1 + 20 
= 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (9, 6, 8)>
<6, (8, 1, 9)>
<6, (8, 1, 7)>
<6, (8, 1, 0)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 7, 0)>
<9, (3, 6, 8)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>

These unique 3-stars are each found only once in the graph.
