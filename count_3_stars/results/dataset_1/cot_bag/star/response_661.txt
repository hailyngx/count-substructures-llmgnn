Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors
Node 1 has 2 neighbors
Node 2 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 4 neighbors
Node 4 has 2 neighbors
Node 5 has 4 neighbors
Node 6 has 3 neighbors
Node 7 has 3 neighbors
Node 8 has 2 neighbors
Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 34\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (2, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
