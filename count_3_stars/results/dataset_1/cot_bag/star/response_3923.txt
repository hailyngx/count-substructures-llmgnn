Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will follow the steps mentioned earlier. 

Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, and 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, and 8
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, and 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, and 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <7, (0, 5, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (2, 7, 8)>, <8, (3, 7, 8)>

Add up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<2, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 3, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 6)>, 
<3, (1, 2, 8)>, 
<3, (1, 6, 8)>, 
<3, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<8, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<8, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<8, (3, 7, 8)>
