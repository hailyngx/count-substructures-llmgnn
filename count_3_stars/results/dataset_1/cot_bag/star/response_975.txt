Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {4, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: {1, 2, 6}
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: {0, 6, 8}
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: {2, 3, 7}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 

So, the final answer is [8].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
