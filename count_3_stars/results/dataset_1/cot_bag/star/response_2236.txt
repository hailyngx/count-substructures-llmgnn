Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are several nodes with more than 3 neighbors in this graph. Let's determine the 3-stars formed and calculate the total number. 

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 8)
For node 0, there are [C(4,3)] = 4 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8)
For node 1, there are [C(5,3)] = 10 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)
For node 2, there are [C(4,3)] = 4 3-stars:
<2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5, 0), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 9)
For node 5, there are [C(4,3)] = 4 3-stars:
<5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)
For node 8, there are [C(5,3)] = 10 3-stars:
<8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 32. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)> 

So, the final answer is [32].
