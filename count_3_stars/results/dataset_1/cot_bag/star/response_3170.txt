Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 7 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 2 can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 and Node 9 cannot form 3-stars as they have less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [35 + 1 + 4] = [40] \).

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>
