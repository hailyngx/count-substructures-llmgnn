Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1] = 14 \). 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 5)>, 
<1, (0, 3, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 5, 9)>, 
<3, (1, 4, 9)>, 
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
