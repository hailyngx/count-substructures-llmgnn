Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are two nodes with less than 3 neighbors: node 0 with 1 neighbor and node 6 with 2 neighbors. So, no 3-stars are formed with these nodes.

Now, let's analyze the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8, 1 (inom{4}{3} = 4) 3-stars
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6 (inom{3}{3} = 1) 3-star
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (inom{7}{3} = 35) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 8, 4 (inom{4}{3} = 4) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 8, 9, 5 (inom{4}{3} = 4) 3-stars
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 9 (inom{3}{3} = 1) 3-star
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9  (inom{5}{3} = 10) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 9 (inom{4}{3} = 4) 3-stars

Adding the total number of 3-stars from each node: 4 + 1 + 35 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 63.

So, the final answer is [63]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 4)>, <4, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 8)>, <8, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (1, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 8)>, <8, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>
