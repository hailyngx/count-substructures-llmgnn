Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes and sum them up.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<1, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<5, (2, 4, 9)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 9)>

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14

Therefore, there are a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
