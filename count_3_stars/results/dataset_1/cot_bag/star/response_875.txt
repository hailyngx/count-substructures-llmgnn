Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To visualize the graph based on the given edges and nodes, we can represent the connections in the following way:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 6.

Let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 5 has 7 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 8, 9

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars from these nodes:

- Node 5 can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [35 + 1] = 36 \).

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <5, (0, 2, 6)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
