Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges:

```
    1 --- 5       2---8
   /       \     /      
0 -- 7     9   8   
   \       /         
    0 --- 0
   /       \
 9         1 
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 9
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

This gives us a total of 5 3-stars in the graph.

List of unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 2, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [5].
