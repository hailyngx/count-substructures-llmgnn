Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 9), (5, 7), (6, 2), (6, 7), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 8)}

Now, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors
Node 2 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 2 neighbors
Node 6 has 2 neighbors
Node 7 has 3 neighbors
Node 8 has 3 neighbors
Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [11].

The unique 3-stars found are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 0)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 0)>
<2, (3, 0, 1)>
<2, (6, 7, 5)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 2)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
