Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 7
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 7
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 28

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [28].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<3, (2, 5, 7)>
<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<7, (5, 6, 9)>
