Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. <0, (5, 7, 8)>
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. <1, (6, 8, 9)>
3. Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
4. Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
5. Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
6. Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. <5, (0, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 0, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (8, 0, 7)>
7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. <6, (1, 8, 9)>
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars. <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (5, 0, 8)>, <7, (8, 0, 5)>
9. Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so there are 20 3-stars. <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 3)>, <8, (0, 1, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 1)>, <8, (1, 0, 2)>, <8, (1, 0, 3)>, <8, (1, 0, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 0)>, <8, (1, 3, 0)>, <8, (1, 5, 0)>, <8, (1, 6, 0)>, <8, (2, 0, 1)>, <8, (2, 1, 0)>, <8, (3, 0, 1)>, <8, (3, 1, 0)>, <8, (5, 0, 1)>, <8, (6, 0, 1)>, <8, (7, 0, 4)>, <8, (7, 0, 5)>
10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. <9, (1, 5, 6)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a final count of [32].
