Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 6 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is: [1 + 3 + 6 + 3] = 13

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (0, 5, 4)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<4, (8, 5, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 5)>
<5, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 9, 4)>
<8, (7, 4, 9)>
