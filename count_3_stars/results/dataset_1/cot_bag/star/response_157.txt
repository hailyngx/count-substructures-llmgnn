Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1, 6
- Node 9: 0

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing these up, we get a total of 32 3-stars. Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [32].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 7)>
<3, (4, 5, 7)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
