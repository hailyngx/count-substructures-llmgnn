Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 6: 5
- Node 7: 0, 5, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 7

Let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <0, (2, 7, 9)>

- Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 3-stars

- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <4, (1, 5, 8)>

- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
  - <5, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <5, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <5, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <5, (6, 7, 8)>

- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <7, (0, 5, 9)>

- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
  - <8, (3, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 8.   
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
