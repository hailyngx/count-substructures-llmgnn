Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 2, 7

Now we can find the number of 3-stars formed around each node:
- Node 2: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 3: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 2, which we can represent as [2].

The 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 7)>
