Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 42 edges, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0:
- Neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 1:
- Neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 3:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Node 4:
- Neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 6:
- Neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 8:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Node 9:
- Neighbors: 4, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 71

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [71], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<8, (4, 6, 9)>
