Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 6
Node 1: 4, 7
Node 3: 8
Node 4: 1, 5, 8
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 3, 4

Based on the criteria mentioned earlier, node 1 and node 4 can form 3-stars. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
For node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1.

Therefore, the final answer is [1]. The unique 3-star found in the graph is <4, (1, 5, 8)>.
