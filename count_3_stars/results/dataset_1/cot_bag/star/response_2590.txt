Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 9), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 6), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 6), (9, 7)}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4. The 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>

Node 1: has 2 neighbors (0, 6) < 3, so no 3-stars.

Node 2: has 2 neighbors (0, 9) < 3, so no 3-stars.

Node 3: has 1 neighbor < 3, so no 3-stars.

Node 4: has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9) => 1 3-star: <4, (0, 8, 9)>

Node 5: has 1 neighbor < 3, so no 3-stars.

Node 6: has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 9) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4. The 3-stars are: <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>

Node 7: has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9) => 1 3-star: <7, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 8: has 2 neighbors (4, 7) < 3, so no 3-stars.

Node 9: has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 7) => [inom{4}{3}] = 4. The 3-stars are: <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4] = 14.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are as follows:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 6)>, <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>
