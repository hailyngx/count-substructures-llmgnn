Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this given graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors.

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 6
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 9
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <3, (0, 4, 7)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <4, (1, 3, 6)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  <7, (1, 3, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <9, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 7)>, <9, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>, <9, (2, 7, 9)>

Summing up the total number of unique 3-stars: [4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10] = [17]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 17.
