Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 8)

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>

So, the final answer is [6].
