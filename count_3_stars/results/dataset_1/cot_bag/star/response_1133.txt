Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 7, and 8. 

For node 0:
There are 5 edges connected to node 0, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)> 
This contributes 5 3-stars.

For node 3:
There are 5 edges connected to node 3, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<3, (0, 1, 6)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)> 
This contributes 5 3-stars.

For node 4:
There are 5 edges connected to node 4, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)> 
This contributes 5 3-stars.

For node 7:
There are 4 edges connected to node 7, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)> 
This contributes 4 3-stars.

For node 8:
There are 4 edges connected to node 8, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<8, (2, 3, 6)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (3, 6, 7)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)> 
This contributes 4 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 5 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 23 \).
Thus, the final answer is [23].
