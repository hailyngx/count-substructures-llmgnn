Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>

Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 8. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 + 10] = 24. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 4)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
