Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are some nodes that have three or more neighbors in this graph. Let's identify those nodes and count the number of 3-stars they form:

For node 0:
- Neighbors: 1, 4, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 9)>

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 4, 6, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars: <2, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 3:
- Neighbors: 5, 7, 8
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-stars: <3, (5, 7, 8)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>.
