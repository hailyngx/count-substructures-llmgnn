Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and the specified edges, we will first determine the number of 3-stars formed in this graph.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 7.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, 9.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 8.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 7, 8.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 8.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 7.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 2.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
