Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed around each of these nodes:

1. Node 1:
    - Node 1 has 2 3-stars
    
2. Node 4:
    - Node 4 has 2 3-stars
    
3. Node 5:
    - Node 5 has 4 3-stars
    
4. Node 6:
    - Node 6 has 4 3-stars
    
5. Node 9:
    - Node 9 has 2 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 9>
<5, 2, 6>
<6, 1, 2>
<6, 4, 7>
<6, 5, 8>
