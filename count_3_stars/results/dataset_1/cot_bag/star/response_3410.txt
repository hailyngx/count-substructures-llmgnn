Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph can be arranged as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, 7.


Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

- Nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 have 4 neighbors each.
- Nodes 7 and 8 have 3 neighbors each.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 26

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found are:
