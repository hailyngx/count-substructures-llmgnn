Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with at least three neighbors in this graph. Let's find the 3-stars formed by each of these nodes.

For node 1: (1, 7, 8), (1, 7, 4), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 7), (1, 8, 2), (1, 8, 9), (1, 7, 4), (1, 7, 8), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 1)
For node 2: (2, 8, 1), (2, 8, 6), (2, 8, 7), (2, 8, 9), (2, 9, 3), (2, 9, 6), (2, 9, 7), (2, 7, 1), (2, 7, 6), (2, 7, 8)
For node 3: (3, 9, 2), (3, 9, 6), (3, 9, 7), (3, 6, 4), (3, 6, 5), (3, 6, 8), (3, 6, 9), (3, 9, 2), (3, 9, 6), (3, 9, 7)
For node 6: (6, 8, 1), (6, 8, 2), (6, 8, 7), (6, 8, 9), (6, 9, 2), (6, 9, 3), (6, 9, 7), (6, 7, 1), (6, 7, 4), (6, 7, 8)
For node 7: (7, 9, 2), (7, 9, 3), (7, 9, 6), (7, 8, 1), (7, 8, 2), (7, 8, 6), (7, 8, 7), (7, 6, 4), (7, 6, 5), (7, 6, 8)
For node 8: (8, 6, 1), (8, 6, 2), (8, 6, 7), (8, 6, 9), (8, 7, 1), (8, 7, 4), (8, 7, 8), (8, 7, 9), (8, 9, 2), (8, 9, 3)
For node 9: (9, 6, 4), (9, 6, 5), (9, 6, 8), (9, 6, 9), (9, 7, 1), (9, 7, 4), (9, 7, 8), (9, 7, 9), (9, 2, 3), (9, 2, 6)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:   \[ \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{7}{3} + \binom{8}{3} + \binom{9}{3} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 35 + 56 + 84 = 197 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [197]. 
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, 7, 8>, <1, 7, 4>, <1, 7, 9>, <1, 8, 7>, <1, 8, 2>, <1, 8, 9>, <2, 8, 1>, <2, 8, 6>, <2, 8, 7>, <2, 8, 9>, <2, 9, 3>, 
<2, 9, 6>, <2, 9, 7>, <3, 9, 2>, <3, 9, 6>, <3, 9, 7>, <3, 6, 4>, <3, 6, 5>, <3, 6, 8>, <3, 6, 9>, <6, 8, 1>, <6, 8, 2>, 
<6, 8, 7>, <6, 8, 9>, <6, 9, 2>, <6, 9, 3>, <6, 9, 7>, <6, 7, 1>, <6, 7, 4>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 9, 2>, <7, 9, 3>, <7, 9, 6>, 
<7, 8, 1>, <7, 8, 2>, <7, 8, 6>, <7, 8, 7>, <7, 6, 4>, <7, 6, 5>, <7, 6, 8>, <8, 6, 1>, <8, 6, 2>, <8, 6, 7>, <8, 6, 9>, 
<8, 7, 1>, <8, 7, 4>, <8, 7, 8>, <8, 7, 9>, <8, 9, 2>, <8, 9, 3>, <9, 6, 4>, <9, 6, 5>, <9, 6, 8>, <9, 6, 9>, <9, 7, 1>, 
<9, 7, 4>, <9, 7, 8>, <9, 7, 9>, <9, 2, 3>, <9, 2, 6>.
