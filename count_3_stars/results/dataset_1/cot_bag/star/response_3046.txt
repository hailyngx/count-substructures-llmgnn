Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: There's only 1 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors
- For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: There's only 1 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: There's only 1 3-star since it has exactly 3 neighbors

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 31

Therefore, the final result is [31].

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (1, 2, 5)>
- <0, (1, 5, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <0, (5, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 5, 8)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (0, 3, 6)>
