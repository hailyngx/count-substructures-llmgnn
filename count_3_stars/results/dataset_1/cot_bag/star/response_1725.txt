Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
To determine the 3-star structures in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: 0 3-stars (only 2 neighbors)
- Node 2: 1 3-star <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- Node 3: 1 3-star <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 4: 1 3-star <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- Node 8: 1 3-star <8, (0, 3, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: [4]

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>.
