Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7
Node 3: 0, 6, 7
Node 5: 1, 2, 7, 8
Node 7: 1, 3, 5, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
