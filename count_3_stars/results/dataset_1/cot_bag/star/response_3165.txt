Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 2:
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)> 

For node 3:
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (5, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
