Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 2, 8
Node 2: 0, 5, 7
Node 3: 4
Node 4: 3, 8, 9
Node 5: 2, 9
Node 7: 2, 8
Node 8: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 9: 4, 5, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\)
- Node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7

Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 7, and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 4)>.
