Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The 3-stars in this graph are:
\[ [6] \]
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 7)>
<9, (1, 3, 7)> 

So the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
