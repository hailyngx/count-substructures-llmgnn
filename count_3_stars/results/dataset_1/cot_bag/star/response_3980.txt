Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first determine the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 2: degree 6
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we'll look at the nodes with degree 3 or more and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (3, 5, 7)>
  - <2, (3, 6, 9)>
  
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
  - <3, (0, 2, 5)>
  - <3, (2, 5, 6)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (2, 4, 9)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <7, (2, 3, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  - <8, (0, 3, 7)>

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of 52 3-stars. So, the final answer is [52].
