Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the given edges:  

There are a total of 10 nodes labeled from 0 to 9. Here is the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to node 5
- Node 1 is connected to node 2
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to node 2
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 7
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 7 and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 7 and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 7, and 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph by considering each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 2: There are 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 9) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2.
- For node 5: There are 2 neighbors (0, 7) => No 3-stars with node 5.
- For node 7: There are 5 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 8, 9) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7.
- For node 9: There are 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 9.

Adding up the 3-stars from each node, we have a total of 4 + 10 + 4 = 18 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18]. Listing them out:
<2, (1, 4, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (2, 6, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>.
