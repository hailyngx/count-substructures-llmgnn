Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 9 nodes with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (1, 3, 6)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   Unique 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 6)>

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (0, 6, 7)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   Unique 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 7)>

3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (5, 6, 9)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   Unique 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 9)>

4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (0, 6, 6)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   Unique 3-star: <3, (0, 6, 6)>

5. Node 6 has 6 neighbors: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
   Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, and 10 more

6. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: (1, 8)
   Number of 3-stars: 0

7. Node 8 has 1 neighbor: (7)
   Number of 3-stars: 0

8. Node 4 has 1 neighbor: (6)
   Number of 3-stars: 0

9. Node 5 has 1 neighbor: (2)
   Number of 3-stars: 0

The total number of 3-stars for this graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20] = 24.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>
