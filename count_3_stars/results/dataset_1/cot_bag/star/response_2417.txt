Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 7 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 41 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [41].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 8)>
<3, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 6, 9)>
