Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 21

[21]

Unique 3-stars:
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
