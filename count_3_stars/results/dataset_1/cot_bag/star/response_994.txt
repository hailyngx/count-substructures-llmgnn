Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 3: degree 2
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 5: degree 4
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we'll identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Next, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- For nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 9: \( \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 7 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 39 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [39]. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
