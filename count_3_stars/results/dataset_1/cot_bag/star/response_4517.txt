Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are three nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph: node 2, node 3, and node 6.

For node 2:
- Forming 3-stars with node 2, we have inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

For node 3:
- Forming 3-stars with node 3, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

For node 6:
- Forming 3-stars with node 6, we have inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20 + 4 + 20] = [44].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (6, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 4)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (3, 9, 1)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
