Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9.

Let's determine the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars for each applicable node:
- For Node 0, there are 1 3-star. <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- For Node 1, there are 1 3-star. <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- For Node 2, there are 1 3-star. <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- For Node 4, there are 1 3-star. <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- For Node 5, there are 2 3-stars. <5, (1, 2, 6)> and <5, (4, 6, 7)>
- For Node 6, there are 1 3-star. <6, (1, 4, 5)>
- For Node 7, there are 1 3-star. <7, (2, 4, 5)>
- For Node 8, there are 1 3-star. <8, (0, 5, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [9].
