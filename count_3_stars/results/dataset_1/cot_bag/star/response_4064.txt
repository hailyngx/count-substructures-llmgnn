Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
There is only one node with exactly 3 neighbors in this graph, which is node 1. So we will only consider node 1 to form 3-stars. 

Node 1 has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7). So, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at node 1 using the formula \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Therefore, [10] 3-stars are formed in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>
