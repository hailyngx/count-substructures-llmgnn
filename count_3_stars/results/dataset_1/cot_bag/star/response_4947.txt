Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. 

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 7
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [18].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <1, (2, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
