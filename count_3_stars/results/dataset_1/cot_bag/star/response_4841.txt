Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, and node 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- So, we have 1 3-star with node 0.

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, and 9.
- The number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- So, we have 1 3-star with node 2.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, and 6.
- The number of 3-stars with node 7 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- So, we have 4 3-stars with node 7.

Putting it all together, we have 1 + 1 + 4 = 6 3-stars in total:

[6]

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 4)>, <7, (0, 2, 6)>, <7, (0, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>.
