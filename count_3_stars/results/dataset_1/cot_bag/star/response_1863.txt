Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 3. We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 0: 
There are 6 neighbors for node 0. Thus, the number of 3-stars involving node 0 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).

For node 2: 
There are 5 neighbors for node 2. Thus, the number of 3-stars involving node 2 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

For node 4: 
There are 4 neighbors for node 4. Thus, the number of 3-stars involving node 4 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 5: 
There are 4 neighbors for node 5. Thus, the number of 3-stars involving node 5 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

For node 3: 
There are 3 neighbors for node 3. Since it has exactly 3 neighbors, there is only 1 possible 3-star with node 3 as the center.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 39 \).

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 39. 

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 3)>, <0, (2, 5, 3)>, <0, (4, 5, 3)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [39].
