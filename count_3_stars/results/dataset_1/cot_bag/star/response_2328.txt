Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Taking the given information into account, we construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 9), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7)]

Let's now determine the 3-stars:

For node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 26

Therefore, the final result is [26]. 
The unique 3-stars are listed below:
<0, 7, 8, 9>
<0, 1, 3, 6>
<1, 0, 3, 6>
<8, 0, 5, 6>
<9, 0, 4, 5>
