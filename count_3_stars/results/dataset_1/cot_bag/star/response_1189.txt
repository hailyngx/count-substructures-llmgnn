Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we can calculate the number of 3-stars associated with each of those nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 2

Therefore, the final answer is [2], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <2, (2, 0, 8)>, <3, (8, 0, 1)>.
