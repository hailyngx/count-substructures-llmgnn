Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 3, 4, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 1:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 9)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <3, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7. 

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 5)>, and <9, (1, 3, 8)>.
