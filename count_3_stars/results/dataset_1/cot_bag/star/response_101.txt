Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 2

Now we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

There are no 3-stars that can be formed with the remaining nodes as they have less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4] = 6 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- <5, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (3, 7, 8)>
- <5, (6, 7, 8)>
