Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {2, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 6}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 5}
- Node 4: {5, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {2}
- Node 8: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 9: {2, 6, 8}

Now, we will find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {6, 7, 8}.
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {6, 8, 9}.
- Node 6 forms a 3-star with its neighbors {1, 2, 4}.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>.
