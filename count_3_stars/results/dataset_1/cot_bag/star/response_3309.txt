Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 6), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars. We look for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1), (3, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1)
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (0, 3), (1, 3), (5, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (1, 6), (4, 6), (7, 6)

Now, we can count the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<6, (6, 7, 9)>
