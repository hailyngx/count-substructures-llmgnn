Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually by listing the nodes and their connections:

Node 0: 3, 8
Node 1: 2, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 1, 3, 5, 6
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 9
Node 6: 2
Node 7: 1
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 9
Node 9: 1, 5, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars:

Node 1: <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>
Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 5)>
Node 3: <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)> 
Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [7].
