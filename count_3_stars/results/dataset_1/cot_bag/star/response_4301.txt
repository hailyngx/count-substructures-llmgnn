Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8) -> 1 3-star
Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 7) -> 1 3-star
Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6) -> 1 3-star
Node 5: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 7) -> 1 3-star
Node 6: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 8) -> 1 3-star
Node 7: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 5) -> 1 3-star

So, there are [6] total 3-stars.
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>.
