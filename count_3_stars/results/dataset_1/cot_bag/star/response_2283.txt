Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 8
- 1 is connected to 4 and 6
- 2 is connected to 4 and 6
- 3 is connected to 6
- 4 is connected to 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- 5 is connected to 4
- 6 is connected to 1, 2, 3, 4, 8
- 7 is connected to 4
- 8 is connected to 0, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].

The unique 3-stars are: <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>.
