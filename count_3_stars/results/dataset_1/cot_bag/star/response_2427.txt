Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 1:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 2:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

For node 4:
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]

For node 5:
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]

For node 6:
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]

For node 8:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

Adding these up, we get \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 10 \). So there are 10 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [10] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 8, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 1, 5)>
<8, (5, 1, 6)>
