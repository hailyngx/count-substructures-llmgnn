Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, node 2, node 4, node 5, node 6, and node 7. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars we get: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25]. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (7, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
