Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (4, 1) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the graph with the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 2), (0, 9), 
(1, 4), (1, 8), 
(2, 0), (2, 9), 
(4, 1), 
(5, 8), 
(6, 7), (6, 9), 
(7, 6), 
(8, 1), (8, 5), 
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 6)

Let's now identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 9) [1 3-star]
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (0, 9) [1 3-star]
- Node 6: 3 neighbors (7, 9) [1 3-star]
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (1, 5) [1 3-star]
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6) [C(4, 3)=4 possible 3-stars]

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 2, 9>, <2, 0, 9>, <6, 7, 9>, <8, 1, 5>, <9, 0, 2>, <9, 0, 6>, <9, 2, 6>, <9, 6, 7>
