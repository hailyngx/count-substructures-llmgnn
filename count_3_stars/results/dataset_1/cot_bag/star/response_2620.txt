Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 2. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, and 7).
- There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) way to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star.
- So, for node 0, we have 1 3-star. <0, (1, 2, 7)>

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 4, and 9).
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star.
- So, for node 1, we have 4 3-stars. <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 3, and 6).
- There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) ways to choose 3 neighbors to form a 3-star.
- So, for node 2, we have 4 3-stars. <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4] = 9.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>.
