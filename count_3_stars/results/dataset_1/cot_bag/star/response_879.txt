Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's organize the edges for each node:
- Node 0: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9)
- Node 1: (1, 3) (1, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8)
- Node 4: (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8)
- Node 5: (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8)
- Node 6: (6, 9)
- Node 7: (7, 5) (7, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7)
- Node 9: (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6)

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 42

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 5, 8)>
- <2, (3, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 2, 3)>
- <8, (0, 2, 4)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 5)>
