Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 6, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 7 3-stars. So, the final count is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 1, 8)>
<0, (2, 8, 6)>
<0, (5, 9, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
