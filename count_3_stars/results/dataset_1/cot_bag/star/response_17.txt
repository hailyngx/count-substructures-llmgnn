Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. We will find the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
  <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 1, 6)>, <0, (4, 1, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 4)>

- Node 1: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
  <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (5, 3, 9)>,
  <1, (5, 4, 7)>, <1, (5, 4, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 4, 5)>, <1, (7, 5, 9)>

- Node 4: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
  <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>,
  <4, (6, 0, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 0)>, <4, (6, 7, 1)>, <4, (8, 1, 9)>, <4, (8, 9, 1)>

- Node 5: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
  <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 1, 9)>, <5, (3, 5, 7)>, <5, (3, 5, 9)>,
  <5, (7, 1, 9)>, <5, (7, 3, 5)>, <5, (7, 5, 9)>, <5, (9, 1, 7)>, <5, (9, 3, 5)>

- Node 6: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
  <6, (0, 4, 7)>

- Node 7: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
  <7, (0, 1, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (5, 1, 9)>, <7, (6, 0, 4)>

- Node 9: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
  <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (5, 7, 1)>

Counting all these 3-stars gives us a total of [39] unique 3-stars.
