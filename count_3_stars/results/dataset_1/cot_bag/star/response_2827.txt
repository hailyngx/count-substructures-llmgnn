Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes with at least 3 neighbors, as these nodes can form 3-stars.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9)
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 8), (2, 9)
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8)
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8)
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 9)
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8)
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5)
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 6)
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5)

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
Node 8 can form \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 18 \) 3-stars in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (7, 9, 2)>
<8, (6, 9, 2)>
<5, (7, 9, 2)>
