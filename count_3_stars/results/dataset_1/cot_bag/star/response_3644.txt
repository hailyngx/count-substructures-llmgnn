Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 2, 3, and 8.

For node 2:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed with node 2 as the center:
<2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 5, 2)>, <2, (0, 7, 2)>, <2, (3, 5, 2)>, <2, (3, 7, 2)>, <2, (5, 7, 2)>

For node 3:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 3 as the center:
<3, (2, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 9)>

For node 8:
There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8 as the center:
<8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 4 + 4] = [18] \).
