Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The node degrees are as follows:
Node 0: 2
Node 1: 1
Node 2: 1
Node 3: 1
Node 4: 3
Node 5: 2
Node 6: 4
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 4

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
Node 6 forms 4 3-stars.
Node 9 forms 4 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of [9] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 9, 4)>
<6, (9, 0, 4)>
<6, (9, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (6, 4, 5)>
