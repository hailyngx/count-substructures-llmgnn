Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it can't form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the 3-stars we found:
\[ [4 + 4 + 20 + 20 + 10] = [58] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 1, 6)>, <4, (2, 1, 6)>, <4, (2, 1, 6)>, <4, (2, 1, 6)>, <4, (3, 1, 6)>, <4, (3, 1, 6)>, <4, (3, 1, 6)>, <4, (3, 1, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (0, 1, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 9)>
