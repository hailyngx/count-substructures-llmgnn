Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars it is a part of:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 8)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6)
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (6, 9)
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor (1)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7)
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor (6)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [inom{3}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{1}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{1}{3} + inom{4}{3} + inom{1}{3}] = [1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 0] = [13]

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<4, (6, 9, 1)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 0)>
<6, (1, 5, 2)>
<6, (7, 4, 0)>
<6, (7, 4, 1)>

So, the final answer is [13].
