Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a few nodes with 3 or more neighbors in this graph:

- Node 0: has 5 neighbors
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors
- Node 2: has 5 neighbors
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors
- Node 4: has 2 neighbors
- Node 5: has 1 neighbor
- Node 6: has 2 neighbors
- Node 7: has 5 neighbors
- Node 8: has 3 neighbors
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 2) + 10 (from Node 7) + 1 (from Node 8) + 1 (from Node 9) = 32

So, there are 32 total 3-stars in this graph, which are represented by the following unique combinations:
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 2, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
