Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 5, 8)>
