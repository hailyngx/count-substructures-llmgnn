Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges using the information provided: 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 1), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 2), (9, 5)

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have at least 3 neighbors to find the possible 3-stars:

Node 2: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (2, 9) - forms 4 3-stars
Node 3: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8) - forms 4 3-stars
Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 9) - forms 5 3-stars

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
4 (3-stars from node 2) + 4 (3-stars from node 3) + 5 (3-stars from node 5) = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 6, 9)>
<5, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (2, 5, 9)>
<5, (4, 5, 9)>
<5, (5, 6, 9)>
