Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 7, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5
- Node 3: 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 3
- Node 6: 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 7

Let's see which nodes have at least three neighbors:

- Node 1, Node 3, Node 4, Node 7, and Node 9 have more than three neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 14 \) 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
