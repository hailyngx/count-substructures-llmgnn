Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
We will first draw the graph according to the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.

Now, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, and 5.

For node 0, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

For node 3, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 5, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 1] = [15] \).

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 7)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>.
