Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) 

Response:
First, let's build the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
Edges: 
(1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 3), (5, 6), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 2), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 2), (8, 7)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {3, 4, 7, 8}, so we have $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $ 3-stars with node 2 as the center.
The 3-stars with node 2 as the center are:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: {2, 4, 5, 6}, so we have $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
The 3-stars with node 3 as the center are:
<3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 6}, so we have $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $ 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
The 3-stars with node 4 as the center are:
<4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
4 + 10 + 10 = 24

So, there are 24 3-stars in this graph:
[24]
Unique 3-stars:
<2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>
