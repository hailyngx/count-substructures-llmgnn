Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 6, 8, 9
  - Node 0 forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 8, 9)>, forming a 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 1
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 8
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 5
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 6
  - Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 4, 6)>, forming a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 0
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 9
  - Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 9)>, forming a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 7, 8, 9
  - Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 7, 8)>, forming a 3-star.

From the above analysis, we have found 3 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3].
