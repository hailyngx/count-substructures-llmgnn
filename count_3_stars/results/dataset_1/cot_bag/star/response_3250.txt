Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 0, 8)>, <0, (8, 9, 0)>, <0, (8, 0, 7)>, <0, (9, 0, 8)>, <0, (9, 8, 0)>, <0, (8, 0, 9)>

For node 1:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (5, 7, 9)>

For node 8:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<9, (0, 3, 8)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars we get: 10 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].
