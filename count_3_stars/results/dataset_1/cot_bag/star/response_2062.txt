Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

The edges in this graph are: 
(1, 3), (1, 6)
(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 9)
(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 9)
(4, 2), (4, 3)
(5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9)
(6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 8)
(7, 5), (7, 9)
(8, 5), (8, 6)
(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

- Node 3 has 6 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

For node 3:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \] unique 3-stars can be formed.

For node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] unique 3-stars can be formed.

For node 9:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \] unique 3-stars can be formed.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is:
\[ [20 + 4 + 4] = [28] \]

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (4, 5, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 7, 9)>
