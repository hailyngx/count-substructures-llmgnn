Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. We can then calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 6
   Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   <0, (3, 5, 6)>

2. Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9
   Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
   <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>,
   <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>

3. Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
   Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
   <4, (1, 2, 3)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>,
   <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>

4. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8
   Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
   <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>

5. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 8
   Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   <6, (0, 4, 8)>

6. Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 6
   Number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
   <8, (3, 5, 6)>

In total, we have 27 unique 3-stars in this graph. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [27].
