Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph provided, we will first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 5}
- Node 2: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 5: Neighbors {1, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {3, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 9}
- Node 8: Neighbors {0, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {4, 7}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 2, 5)
- Node 2: 1 3-star (2, 1, 5)
- Node 5: \({{5}\choose{3}} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 6: 1 3-star (6, 3, 5)
- Node 7: 1 3-star (7, 5, 9)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 0, 5)
- Node 9: 1 3-star (9, 4, 7)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 5) + 1 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 1 (from node 8) + 1 (from node 9) = 16

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16]. The unique 3-stars are:
<1, 2, 5>, <6, 3, 5>, <7, 5, 9>, <8, 0, 5>, <9, 4, 7>
