Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given graph, we construct the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 4), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 6), (9, 0), (9, 7)]

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 9)>
  
For node 2, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<2, (0, 3, 4)>

For node 4, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
<4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 6, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<6, (0, 4, 7)>

For node 7, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
<7, (4, 6, 9)>

Combining all the 3-stars found so far, we have a total of [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 11 3-stars in the given graph.
Thus, the final answer is [11].
