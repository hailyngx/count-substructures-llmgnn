Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

From node 4: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>
From node 6: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (8, 4, 3)>

Putting these together, we have a total of [4] 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (5, 8, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (8, 4, 3)>.
