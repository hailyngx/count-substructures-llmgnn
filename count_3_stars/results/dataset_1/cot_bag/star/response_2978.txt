Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are as follows:
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Now, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 4, 8
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 6
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 2, 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 7, 8

Now, we'll find the total number of 3-stars.

For Node 2:
- Neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Possible 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>

For Node 6:
- Neighbors: 1, 2, 5
- Possible 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ <6, (1, 2, 5)>

For Node 8:
- Neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Possible 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>

Adding them up, we get a total of [9] unique 3-stars:
<2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>
