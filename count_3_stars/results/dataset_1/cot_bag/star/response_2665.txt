Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges based on the given information:

```
    1---2
    |   |
6---5---4---9
|   |   |   |
|   7---0---8
|           |
3           |
            |
            |
```

We can see that node 0, 5, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars they can form.

For node 0:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 0)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- 3-star: <9, (4, 0, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9]. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (7, 8, 0)>, and <9, (4, 0, 8)>.
