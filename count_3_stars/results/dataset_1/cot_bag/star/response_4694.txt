Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: There is only 1 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 26 3-stars. Hence, the answer is [26].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
