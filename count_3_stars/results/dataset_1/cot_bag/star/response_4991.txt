Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, for each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars formed. 

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 15 3-stars.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 9)>
<4, (9, 8, 0)>
<4, (9, 7, 1)>
<4, (0, 7, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (9, 4, 1)>
<8, (9, 7, 3)>
<8, (6, 0, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 1)>
<9, (4, 3, 7)>
<9, (4, 1, 7)>
