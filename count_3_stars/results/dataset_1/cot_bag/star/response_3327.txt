Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections can be visualized as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 7, 8.

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: It has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 9), so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (1, 3, 9)>

For node 1: It has 2 neighbors (0, 4), so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 3: It has 2 neighbors (0, 4), so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 4: It has 2 neighbors (1, 3), so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 6: It has 2 neighbors (2, 8), so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 7: It has 2 neighbors (8, 9), so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 8: It has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star. <8, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 9: It has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 8), so it can form 1 3-star. <9, (0, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <8, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>.
