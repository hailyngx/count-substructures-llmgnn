Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 21

So, there are [21] 3-stars in this graph, and they are:

<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (1, 0, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 1, 9)>
<4, (6, 0, 1)>
<4, (6, 0, 5)>
<4, (6, 5, 0)>
<5, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 1, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 0)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 3, 9)>
<5, (9, 4, 1)>
<5, (9, 4, 6)>
<5, (9, 7, 3)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>
