Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 8. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, and 8.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, and 9.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>, <8, (7, 9, 0)>, <8, (7, 9, 5)>.
