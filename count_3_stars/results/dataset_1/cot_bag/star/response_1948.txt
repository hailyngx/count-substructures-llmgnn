Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}

Now, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- For nodes with 3 neighbors: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star formed per node.
- For nodes with 2 neighbors: Less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars formed.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

- Node 1: <1, 4, 5>
- Node 2: <2, 5, 6>
- Node 4: <4, 1, 9>
- Node 5: <5, 1, 2>
- Node 6: <6, 2, 7>
- Node 7: <7, 2, 3>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
