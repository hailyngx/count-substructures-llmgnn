Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The central nodes that have at least three neighbors are nodes 4, 5, 8, and 9. 

For node 4:
The number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 4 as the central node: <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>.

For node 5:
The number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). 
So, there is 1 unique 3-star with node 5 as the central node: <5, (0, 4, 8)>.

For node 8:
The number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). 
So, there are 4 unique 3-stars with node 8 as the central node: <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (5, 4, 9)>.

For node 9:
The number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). 
So, there is 1 unique 3-star with node 9 as the central node: <9, (2, 6, 8)>.

Counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 10 3-stars in total. 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
