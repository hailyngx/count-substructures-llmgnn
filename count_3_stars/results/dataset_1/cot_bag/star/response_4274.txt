Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed below:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 5, 8
- Node 2: 0, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1, 8, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 9: 5, 7, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
  <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (6, 3, 4)>, <2, (3, 8, 4)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  <3, (0, 4, 6)>, <3, (0, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <3, (4, 8, 7)>, 
  <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 4, 8)>, <3, (6, 8, 7)>, <3, (7, 8, 4)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{2} \)
  <5, (1, 8, 9)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>,
  <8, (5, 9, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 3)>, <8, (5, 3, 4)>, <8, (5, 4, 6)>, <8, (9, 7, 3)>,
  <8, (9, 3, 4)>, <8, (9, 4, 6)>, <8, (7, 3, 4)>, <8, (7, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>,
  <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 9, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 3)>, <8, (1, 3, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 3 + 10 + 1 + 20 = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [34].
