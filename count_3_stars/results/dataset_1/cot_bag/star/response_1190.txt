Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's go through each node to identify the 3-stars and count the total number of them.

For node 0:
  - Node 0 has neighbors 3, 9.
  - This forms 1 3-star: <0, (3, 9)>.
  
For node 1:
  - Node 1 has neighbors 2, 3, 9.
  - This forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 3, 9)>.
  
For node 2:
  - Node 2 has neighbor 1.
  - Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
  
For node 3:
  - Node 3 has neighbors 0, 1, 4, 5.
  - This forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 5)>.
  
For node 4:
  - Node 4 has neighbors 3, 5, 7.
  - This forms 1 3-star: <4, (3, 5, 7)>.
  
For node 5:
  - Node 5 has neighbors 3, 4.
  - Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
  
For node 6:
  - Node 6 has neighbors 8, 9.
  - This forms 1 3-star: <6, (8, 9)>.
  
For node 7:
  - Node 7 has neighbor 4.
  - Since it has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.
  
For node 8:
  - Node 8 has neighbors 6, 9.
  - This forms 1 3-star: <8, (6, 9)>.
  
For node 9:
  - Node 9 has neighbors 0, 1, 6, 8.
  - This forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 6, 8)>.
  
Total number of 3-stars = 5, so the answer is [5].
