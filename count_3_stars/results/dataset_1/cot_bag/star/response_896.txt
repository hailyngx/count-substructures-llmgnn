Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (2, 4, 6)>
  - <0, (2, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <0, (2, 4, 8)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <2, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <2, (5, 7, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 5, 9)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <5, (1, 6, 8)>
  - <5, (1, 8, 7)>
  - <5, (1, 7, 3)>
  - <5, (1, 6, 0)>
  - <5, (1, 6, 2)>
  - <5, (6, 8, 0)>
  - <5, (6, 8, 2)>
  - <5, (6, 0, 2)>
  - <5, (6, 0, 4)>
  - <5, (8, 2, 4)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (1, 3, 9)>
  - <7, (3, 9, 8)>
  - <7, (1, 9, 8)>
  - <7, (1, 3, 2)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <8, (0, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (0, 6, 4)>
  - <8, (4, 9, 5)>
  - <8, (9, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 5)>
  - <8, (0, 4, 6)>
  - <8, (5, 6, 9)>
  - <8, (4, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (0, 9, 5)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (2, 3, 7)>
  - <9, (2, 7, 5)>
  - <9, (3, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (2, 5, 6)>

Adding all the 3-stars formed by these nodes gives a total of [32].
