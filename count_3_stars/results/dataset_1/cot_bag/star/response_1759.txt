Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.
- Node 7 is not connected to any other node.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8).
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 6, 7).
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 = 5].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 6, 8)>
- <8, (1, 5, 6)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (1, 6, 7)>
- <8, (5, 6, 7)>
