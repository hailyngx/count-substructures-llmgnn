Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the number of 3-stars in the graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 6. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (1, 2, 6)>.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 3. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 1 as the center: <1, (0, 2, 3)>.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 6. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (1, 5, 6)>.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 6. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (3, 4, 6)>.

Node 6 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9. So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) additional 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
<6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (0, 8, 9)>,
<6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>.

Node 7 has 1 neighbor, not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 8 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.

Node 9 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 3) + 20 (from node 6) = 23. 

So, the final result inside brackets is [23].
