Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given edges:

```
    1 -- 3 -- 6 -- 9
   /|    |    |    | 
  0 |    4 -- 5    7
   \|/   ||   ||   |/
    8 -- 2    6 -- 9
```
  
Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the final answer is [18], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 5)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 0, 5)>, <4, (9, 0, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>.
