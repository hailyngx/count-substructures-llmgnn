Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the provided information:
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 5.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1] = [3].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>.
