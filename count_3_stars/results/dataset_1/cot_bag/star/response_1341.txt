Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 8.
  - <1, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <1, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <1, (4, 7, 8)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor. 
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, 7.
  - <8, (1, 3, 6)>
  - <8, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <8, (1, 7, 3)>
  - <8, (3, 6, 7)>

Adding up the possibilities we calculated based on each node, we get a total of 10 3-stars. So, the final answer is [10].
