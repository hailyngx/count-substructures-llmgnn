Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 8
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 7, 9
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 8
Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 9
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 8

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 7, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
