Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:

Node 0: 5, 6
Node 1: 5
Node 2: 4, 8, 9
Node 3: 7
Node 4: 2, 5
Node 5: 0, 1, 4
Node 6: 0
Node 7: 3, 8
Node 8: 2, 7, 9
Node 9: 2, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 1: inom{1}{3} = 0
Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3: inom{1}{3} = 0
Node 4: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

So, there are 3 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, 4, 5>
<5, 0, 1>
<8, 2, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
