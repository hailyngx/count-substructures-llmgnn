Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if they can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 8
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, and 8
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, and 8
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, and 9
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, and 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, and 5
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, and 6
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: There's only 1 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: There's only 1 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: There's only 1 3-star (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 2, 4)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 3, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 8)>
<8, (4, 6, 8)>
