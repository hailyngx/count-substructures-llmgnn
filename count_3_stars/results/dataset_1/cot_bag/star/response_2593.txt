Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 0: 4, 7, 8  
Node 1: 6, 9  
Node 3: 8  
Node 4: 0  
Node 6: 1, 9  
Node 7: 0  
Node 8: 0, 3  
Node 9: 1, 6  

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, Node 8, Node 9

For Node 0:
There are 3 choices to pick 3 neighbors out of the listed neighbors (4, 7, 8), which form 1 unique 3-star.  
So, Node 0 contributes [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.  
<0, (4, 7, 8)>  

For Node 8:
There are 3 choices to pick 3 neighbors out of the listed neighbors (0, 3), which form 1 unique 3-star.  
So, Node 8 contributes [inom{2}{3}] = 1 3-star.  
<8, (0, 3, X)>  

For Node 9:
There are 3 choices to pick 3 neighbors out of the listed neighbors (1, 6, 9), which form 1 unique 3-star.  
So, Node 9 contributes [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.  
<9, (1, 6, X)>  

Putting this together, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1] = 3.  

Therefore, inside the brackets, we have [3].  
The unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, X)>, and <9, (1, 6, X)>.
