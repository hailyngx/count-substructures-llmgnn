Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 6, 9)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 9)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 8)

Now, we apply the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we find that there are a total of 11 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 2, 3)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 3, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 8, 9)>.
