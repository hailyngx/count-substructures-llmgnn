Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to node 7.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (2, 5, 6)>
Node 2 forms 1 3-star: <2, (1, 3, 7)>
Node 3 forms 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (0, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>
Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (1, 3, 7)>
Node 7 forms 1 3-star: <7, (2, 4, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 8.
