Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The 3-star graphs in this scenario are formed by nodes with three or more neighbors. 
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first:  
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 6
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 2, 4

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 3: 1 (as it only has 3 neighbors)  
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Adding up the 3-stars for each node, we have \( 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 \).  
So, there are a total of [17] 3-stars in this graph. Let's list the unique 3-stars found:  
- <2, (6, 7, 8)>  
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>  
- <6, (2, 3, 5)>  
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>  
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
