Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Applying the conditions for a 3-star graph to each node, we find the following:

Node 0: (0, 5, 7), (0, 5, 9), (0, 7, 9) => [3]
Node 1: (1, 7, 8), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 9) => [3]
Node 2: (2, 3, 8) => [1]
Node 3: (3, 2, 8), (3, 4, 6), (3, 4, 8) => [3]
Node 4: (4, 3, 6), (4, 3, 9) => [2]
Node 5: (5, 0, 9), (5, 7, 9), (5, 8, 9) => [3]
Node 6: (6, 4, 8) => [1]
Node 7: (7, 0, 9), (7, 1, 9) => [2]
Node 8: (8, 1, 9), (8, 3, 5), (8, 3, 6), (8, 5, 9), (8, 6, 9) => [5]
Node 9: (9, 0, 7), (9, 1, 7), (9, 4, 5) => [3]

Total number of 3-stars: 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 3 = 23

Therefore, the total number of 3-star graphs in this graph is [23]. 
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6)>, <5, (0, 9)>, <6, (4, 8)>, <7, (0, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 7)>.
