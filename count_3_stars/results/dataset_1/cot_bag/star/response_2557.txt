Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors {3, 4, 5}
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors {2, 3, 4, 5}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors {1, 7, 8}
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors {2, 8, 9}

We will now calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [11], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>
