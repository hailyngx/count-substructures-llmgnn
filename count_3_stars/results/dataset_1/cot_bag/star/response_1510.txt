Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 6, node 3, and node 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, and 5.
- Number of 3-star configurations for node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 6: <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 6, 8, 9, and 6.
- Number of 3-star configurations for node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 3: <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 5)>, <3, (6, 9, 5)>, <3, (8, 9, 5)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Number of 3-star configurations for node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars for node 8: <8, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 12 3-stars.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
