Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 1: There's only 1 3-star
- For Node 2: There's only 1 3-star
- For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [14] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<0, (1, 9, 6)>
<0, (1, 9, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 0)>
<0, (2, 8, 5)>
<0, (3, 2, 0)>
<0, (9, 6, 1)>
<0, (9, 8, 5)>
<1, (0, 6, 9)>
<1, (0, 7, 5)>
<8, (2, 5, 0)>
<9, (0, 6, 1)>
<9, (0, 8, 2)>
