Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  
Let's analyze the number of neighbors for each node:

- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 2 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 37 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [37], and the unique 3-stars found are: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, and <7, (1, 4, 5)>.
