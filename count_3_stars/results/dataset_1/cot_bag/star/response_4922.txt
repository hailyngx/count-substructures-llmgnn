Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

From the list of edges given, the degrees of the nodes are as follows:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 1
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 7
- Node 9: degree 1

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:

Node 0: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 2: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 3: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 4: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 6: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
Node 7: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
Node 8: \({7 \choose 3} = 35\) 3-stars

Adding these up:

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 35 = 50

Therefore, there are a total of [50] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<6, (7, 8, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 6, 7)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 8, 9)>
