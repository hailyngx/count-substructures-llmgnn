Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Applying the concept of a 3-star graph to this scenario:

- Node 0 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 1 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 2 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 3 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 4 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 5 is connected to 4 nodes.
- Node 6 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 7 is connected to 1 node.
- Node 8 is connected to 2 nodes.
- Node 9 is connected to 6 nodes.

Nodes 1, 5, and 9 have 4 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars in those nodes.

For node 1:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
For node 9:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 4 + 20 = 28 \)

Therefore, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>.
