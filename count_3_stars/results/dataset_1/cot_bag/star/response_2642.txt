Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to check each node that has three or more neighbors.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (0, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 7), so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5), so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 18 

Therefore, the final answer is [18] and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<9, (2, 4, 5)>
