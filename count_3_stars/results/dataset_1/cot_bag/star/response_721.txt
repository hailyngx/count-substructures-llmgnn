Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 8
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 9
- Node 9: 7, 8

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [1] 3-stars
- Node 1: [1] 3-stars
- Node 2: [0] 3-stars
- Node 3: [1] 3-stars
- Node 4: [1] 3-stars
- Node 5: [0] 3-stars
- Node 6: [0] 3-stars
- Node 7: [0] 3-stars
- Node 8: [1] 3-stars
- Node 9: [0] 3-stars

So, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the given graph. Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 0)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
