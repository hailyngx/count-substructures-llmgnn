Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we'll construct the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges as described. 

The graph representation is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4 and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 0.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 4.

Next, we'll find the 3-stars in this graph. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 9

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].
