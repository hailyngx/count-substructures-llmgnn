Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: Node 0 has 5 neighbors - 3, 5, 7, 8, 9.
There are inom{5}{3} = 10 ways to choose 3 neighbors from 5. 
Thus, there are 10 possible 3-stars with node 0: 
<0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>

Node 2: Node 2 has 3 neighbors - 1, 7, 9.
Since node 2 has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms only 1 3-star: <2, (1, 7, 9)>

Node 3: Node 3 has 2 neighbors - 0, 8. 
Since node 3 has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

Node 4: Node 4 has 1 neighbor - 9. 
Since node 4 has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

Node 5: Node 5 has 2 neighbors - 0, 6.
Since node 5 has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

Node 6: Node 6 has 1 neighbor - 5. 
Since node 6 has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

Node 7: Node 7 has 2 neighbors - 0, 2.
Since node 7 has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed.

Node 8: Node 8 has 3 neighbors - 0, 3, 9.
Since node 8 has exactly 3 neighbors, it forms only 1 3-star: <8, (0, 3, 9)>

Node 9: Node 9 has 4 neighbors - 0, 2, 4, 8. 
There are inom{4}{3} = 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors from 4. 
Thus, there are 4 possible 3-stars with node 9:
<9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars is [16].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 9)>, <0, (5, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>, <9, (0, 2, 8)>, <9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>
