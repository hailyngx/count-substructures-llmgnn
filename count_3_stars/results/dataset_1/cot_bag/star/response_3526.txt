Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars. The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 9.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (1, 7, 9)>
  
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <1, (0, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (0, 6, 3)>
  
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
  
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <6, (1, 5, 8)>
  
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <7, (0, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 3)>
  
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <9, (0, 1, 7)>, <9, (0, 7, 1)>, <9, (1, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 7, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 20

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [20].
