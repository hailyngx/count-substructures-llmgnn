Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 2 3-stars.
- Node 1: It has 4 3-stars.
- Node 3: It has 1 3-star.
- Node 4: It has 2 3-stars.
- Node 5: It has 2 3-stars.
- Node 7: It has 2 3-stars.

Adding them together: 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (3, 8, 5)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>.
