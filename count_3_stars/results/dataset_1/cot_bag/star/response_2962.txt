Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1+4+4] = [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 8, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 9)>
<4, (2, 3, 5)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 3, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 9, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
