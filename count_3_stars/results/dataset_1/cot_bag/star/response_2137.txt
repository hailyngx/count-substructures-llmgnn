Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (4, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes that have 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 6, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 2: Node 2 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 6: Node 6 has 6 3-stars.
- Node 7: Node 7 has 2 3-stars.

Adding these up: 2 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 13.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (6, 0, 3)>
- <2, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <6, (2, 0, 4)>
- <6, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (3, 0, 4)>
- <6, (3, 4, 9)>
- <6, (4, 0, 9)>
- <6, (9, 0, 4)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (2, 0, 5)>
