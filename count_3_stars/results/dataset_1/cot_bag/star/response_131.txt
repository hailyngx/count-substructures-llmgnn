Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors:  
- Node 0 (neighbors: 1, 2)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 0, 6)
- Node 2 (neighbors: 0, 8)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 4, 8)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 1, 7)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 4, 6)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 2, 4, 5)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 4)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: inom{1}{3} = 0   (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4   (<4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>)
- Node 5: inom{1}{3} = 0  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: inom{1}{3} = 0  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: inom{1}{3} = 0  (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1  (<8, (4, 5, 7)>)
- Node 9: inom{0}{3} = 0  (Less than 3 neighbors)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars found:
<4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 5, 7)>
