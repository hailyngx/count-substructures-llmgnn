Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 28 \)

So, there are a total of [28] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 6, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (7, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (2, 4, 5)>
