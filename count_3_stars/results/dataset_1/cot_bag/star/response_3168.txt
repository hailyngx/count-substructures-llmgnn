Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors, along with their neighbors:  

Node 0: 3, 7  
Node 1: 2, 8  
Node 2: 1, 4, 9  
Node 3: 0, 5, 6, 9  
Node 5: 3, 7  
Node 7: 0, 5  
Node 8: 1, 9  
Node 9: 2, 3, 8  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: [inom{2}{3}] = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6.  

So, the final answer is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
