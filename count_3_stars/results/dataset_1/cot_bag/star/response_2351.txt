Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list those nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: {3, 4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5}
- Node 4: {0, 7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 4, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {4, 5, 7}

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 26 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 6)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
