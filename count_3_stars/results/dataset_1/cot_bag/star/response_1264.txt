Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

For node 0:
- There are 2 ways to choose 3 neighbors from the 4 available.
- So, there are [2] 3-stars with node 0 as the center. 
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 9, 4)>, <0, (6, 9, 7)>

For node 3:
- There are 3 ways to choose 3 neighbors from the 4 available.
- So, there are [3] 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 4:
- There are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors from the 5 available.
- So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 9, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 9, 7)>

For node 6:
- There are 3 ways to choose 3 neighbors from the 4 available.
- So, there are [3] 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 3, 4)>

For node 8:
- There are 4 ways to choose 3 neighbors from the 5 available.
- So, there are [4] 3-stars with node 8 as the center.
- Unique 3-stars: <8, (2, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>

For node 9:
- There are 5 ways to choose 3 neighbors from the 6 available.
- So, there are [5] 3-stars with node 9 as the center.
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 8, 5)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [21].
