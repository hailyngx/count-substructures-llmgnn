Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:
- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Edges: (0, 3), (0, 7), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 8), (5, 3), (5, 7), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5), (8, 2), (8, 4), (9, 1), (9, 2)

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, Node 1 has 1 neighbor, Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 9)
  - There is one 3-star with Node 2 as the center: <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 7)
  - There is one 3-star with Node 3 as the center: <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 5)
  - There is one 3-star with Node 7 as the center: <7, (0, 3, 5)>
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

There are a total of 3-stars created with the graph provided: [3].
The unique 3-stars are: <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>.
