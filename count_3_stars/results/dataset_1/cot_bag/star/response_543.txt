Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 3, 4, 6, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (5, 3, 6)>
<0, (7, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 7, 8)>
<9, (7, 8, 4)>
<9, (8, 4, 7)>
