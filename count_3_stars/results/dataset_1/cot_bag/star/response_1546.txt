Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The edges in the graph are:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7, 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 7, 8, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 5, 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 7.

Now, we count the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0: 3 3-stars
- Node 2: 6 3-stars
- Node 3: 3 3-stars
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 5: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star

Summing up: 3 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [16].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
