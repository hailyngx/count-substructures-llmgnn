Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors, along with their neighbors:

- Node 0: Neighbors {2, 5, 6}
- Node 1: Neighbors {2, 4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {0, 1, 6, 9}
- Node 4: Neighbors {1, 9}
- Node 5: Neighbors {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 6: Neighbors {0, 1, 2, 5}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 5}
- Node 9: Neighbors {2, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 23. Therefore, the final answer is [23]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 6, 8)>
- <1, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- <6, (0, 1, 2)>
- <6, (1, 2, 5)>
