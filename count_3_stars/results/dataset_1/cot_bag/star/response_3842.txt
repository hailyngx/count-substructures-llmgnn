Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll examine each node with three or more neighbors.

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Therefore, we'll focus on node 1 and node 4 as they have three or more neighbors.

For node 1:
There are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) ways to form 3-stars with node 1 as the center. Therefore, there are 10 unique 3-stars centered at node 1.

For node 4:
There is exactly 1 way to form a 3-star with node 4 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph can be calculated as \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).
Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [11], and the unique 3-stars are: <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (1, 5, 6)>, <1, (1, 6, 7)>, <1, (1, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 4)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>.
