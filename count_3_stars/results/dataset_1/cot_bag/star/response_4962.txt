Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Observing the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

For node 0:
Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, and 8.
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 2:
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 8, and 9.
Number of 3-stars with node 2 as center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 3:
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 9.
Number of 3-stars with node 3 as center = 1
<3, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 4:
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, and 2.
Since node 4 has less than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed with node 4 as the center.

For node 6:
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, and 8.
Number of 3-stars with node 6 as center = 1
<6, (5, 7, 8)>

For node 7:
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, and 9.
Number of 3-stars with node 7 as center = 1
<7, (6, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 6, and 7.
Number of 3-stars with node 8 as center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>

For node 9:
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 7.
Number of 3-stars with node 9 as center = 1
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for all relevant nodes:
4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 9)>
<2, (4, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 3, 7)>
