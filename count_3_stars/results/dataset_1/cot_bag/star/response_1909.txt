Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors first:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (1, 3, 6, 8)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (0, 4, 7)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (0, 7, 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
1. Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2. Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
5. Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17

So, the total number of 3-stars is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <2, (1, 6, 8)>
- <2, (3, 6, 8)>
- <5, (0, 4, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <7, (0, 6, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 6, 8)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 2, 7)>
- <8, (0, 7, 2)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
