Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are given:

Node 0: 7, 9  
Node 1: 7  
Node 2: 4, 6  
Node 3: 5, 7, 9  
Node 4: 2, 9  
Node 5: 3, 6, 7  
Node 6: 2, 5, 8, 9  
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5  
Node 8: 6  
Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 6  

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0, 3, 6, 7, and 9 have at least 3 neighbors.
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
2. Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <3, (5, 7, 9)>
3. Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
4. Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>
5. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Total number of 3-stars: [1+4+4+4] = [13]

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 3)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>, <7, (0, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, 
<9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>.
