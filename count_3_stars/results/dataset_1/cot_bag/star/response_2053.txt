Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors from which we can form 3-stars. Let's go through each of these nodes and calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with them:

1. Node 0: It has 2 neighbors which are 2 and 9. Thus, no 3-star can be formed with node 0.

2. Node 1: It has 3 neighbors which are 4, 5, and 9. Thus, we can form 1 3-star with node 1 as the center, and the leaves are (4, 5, 9).

3. Node 2: It has 4 neighbors which are 0, 4, 5, and 6. Thus, we can form 4 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
   - <2, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <2, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (5, 6, 4)>

4. Node 3: It has 4 neighbors which are 5, 6, 7, and 8. Thus, we can form 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center:
   - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <3, (7, 8, 6)>
   - <3, (8, 6, 7)>

5. Node 4: It has 3 neighbors which are 1, 2, and 5. Thus, we can form 1 3-star with node 4 as the center, and the leaves are (1, 2, 5).

6. Node 5: It has 5 neighbors which are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9. Thus, we can form 10 3-stars with node 5 as the center:
   - <5, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <5, (1, 4, 9)>
   - <5, (1, 5, 4)>
   - <5, (1, 9, 3)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <5, (2, 4, 3)>
   - <5, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <5, (3, 1, 4)>
   - <5, (3, 2, 4)>
   - <5, (4, 9, 1)>

7. Node 6: It has 4 neighbors which are 2, 3, 7, and 8. Thus, we can form 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center:
   - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
   - <6, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <6, (7, 8, 3)>

8. Node 7: It has 3 neighbors which are 3, 6, and 9. Thus, we can form 1 3-star with node 7 as the center, and the leaves are (3, 6, 9).

9. Node 9: It has 4 neighbors which are 0, 1, 5, and 7. Thus, we can form 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center:
   - <9, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <9, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <9, (5, 7, 0)>
   - <9, (7, 0, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] that can be formed in the graph is 29, and they are listed as follows:
   - <1, (4, 5, 9)>
   - <2, (0, 4, 5)>
   - <2, (0, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (4, 5, 6)>
   - <2, (5, 6, 4)>
   - <3, (5, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <3, (7, 8, 6)>
   - <3, (8, 6, 7)>
   - <4, (1, 2, 5)>
   - <5, (1, 3, 4)>
   - <5, (1, 4, 9)>
   - <5, (1, 5, 4)>
   - <5, (1, 9, 3)>
   - <5, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <5, (2, 4, 3)>
   - <5, (2, 4, 9)>
   - <5, (3, 1, 4)>
   - <5, (3, 2, 4)>
   - <5, (4, 9, 1)>
   - <6, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <6, (2, 7, 8)>
   - <6, (3, 7, 8)>
   - <6, (7, 8, 3)>
   - <7, (3, 6, 9)>
   - <9, (0, 1, 5)>
   - <9, (1, 5, 7)>
   - <9, (5, 7, 0)>
   - <9, (7, 0, 1)>
