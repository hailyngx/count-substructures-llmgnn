Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

We will only focus on nodes 6, 7, and 9 as they have three or more neighbors: 

1. For Node 6:
   - There is 1 3-star with Node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 2, 9)>.

2. For Node 7:
   - There are 4 3-stars with Node 7 as the center: <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>.

3. For Node 9:
   - There is 1 3-star with Node 9 as the center: <9, (0, 3, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 1] = 6.
