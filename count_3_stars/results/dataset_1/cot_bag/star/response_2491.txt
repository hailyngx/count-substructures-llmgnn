Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: 3 neighbors (3, 5, 6) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7, 9) => \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: 2 neighbors (3, 9) => No 3-star
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 7) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 6) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4) => \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 21 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21]. The unique 3-stars are: <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 6)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>.
