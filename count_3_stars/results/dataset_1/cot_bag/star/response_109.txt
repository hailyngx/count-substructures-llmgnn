Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 8, 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 6
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8, 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 5 is connected to node 4
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2
- Node 7 is connected to node 4
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3

Now, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Nodes with >= 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 8

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 8:
Number of 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the final answer is [6].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 8, 9)>
