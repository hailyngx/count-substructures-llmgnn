Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph with the provided edge information:
```
  1 --- 5 --- 2
  |     |     |
  7     3     6
  |           |
  4 --- 9 --- 8
```

Next, we will determine the number of 3-stars in this graph using the method explained earlier. Let's analyze each node:
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star (1, 5, 7)
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star (2, 5, 6)
- Node 3: Forms 1 3-star (3, 5, 8)
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star (4, 7, 9)
- Node 5: Forms \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star (5, 1, 2), completes 2 other 3-stars (1, 5, 7) and (3, 5, 8)
- Node 6: Forms 1 3-star (6, 2, 5)
- Node 7: Forms 1 3-star (7, 1, 4)
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star (8, 3, 5)
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star (9, 4, 7)

So, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
The unique 3-stars found are <1, (5, 7, 1)>, <2, (5, 6, 2)>, <3, (5, 8, 3)>, <4, (7, 9, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>, <9, (7, 4, 9)>.
