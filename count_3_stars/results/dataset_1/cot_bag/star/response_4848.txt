Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

Let's determine how many 3-stars are there in this graph:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, there are $\binom{6}{3} = 20$ 3-stars with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 7, 8. So, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8. So, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9. So, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5. So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- There are no other nodes with at least 3 neighbors.

Adding them up, we get a total of $20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 54$ 3-stars in this graph.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [54], and the unique 3-stars found inside <> are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <7, (0, 1, 4)>
