Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) 

Response:
To calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 6 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 1, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 2, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For Node 3, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5, we have \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 7, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Adding these up, we have a total of 28 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [28], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>.
