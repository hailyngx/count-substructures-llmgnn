Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

Let's determine the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:

Node 1: {2, 5, 6}
Node 2: {1, 7, 9}
Node 3: {6, 7, 8}
Node 4: {6, 7, 8}
Node 5: {1}
Node 6: {1, 3, 4}
Node 7: {2, 3, 4}
Node 8: {3, 4}
Node 9: {2, 3}
Node 10: {}

We see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 3 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 3 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3] = 11.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (2, 3, 4)>
<7, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (6, 3, 4)>
<8, (3, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
