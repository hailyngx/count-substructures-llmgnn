Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 4, 7
- Node 6: 4, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 3, 4, 6

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Node 0: [1]
Node 2: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
Node 4: [1]
Node 6: [1]

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 20 + 1 + 1] = [23]

Unique 3-stars: 
<0, 2, 7, 8>
<2, 0, 1, 4>
<2, 0, 1, 7>
<2, 0, 1, 8>
