Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's go through the nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 6)>.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14. 

So, the final answer is [14].
