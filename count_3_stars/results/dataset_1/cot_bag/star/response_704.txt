Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's examine each node to see if they form any 3-stars:

- Node 0: Node 0 has 2 neighbors (7, 9). It can't form a 3-star.
- Node 1: Node 1 has 1 neighbor (6). It can't form a 3-star.
- Node 2: Node 2 has 2 neighbors (8, 9). It can't form a 3-star.
- Node 3: Node 3 has 2 neighbors (4, 9). It can't form a 3-star.
- Node 4: Node 4 has 1 neighbor (3). It can't form a 3-star.
- Node 6: Node 6 has 1 neighbor (1). It can't form a 3-star.
- Node 7: Node 7 has 2 neighbors (0, 9). It can't form a 3-star.
- Node 8: Node 8 has 2 neighbors (2, 9). It can't form a 3-star.
- Node 9: Node 9 has 8 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 7, 8). It can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 56
So, the final answer is [56] with the unique 3-star being <9, (0, 2, 3)>.
