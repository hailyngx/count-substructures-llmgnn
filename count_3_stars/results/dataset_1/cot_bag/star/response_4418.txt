Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 3, 5, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 8
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 7, 9
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 5, 8
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <1, (3, 5, 9)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <2, (0, 3, 8)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <5, (1, 6, 9)>

- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  <9, (1, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4.
Thus, the answer is [4].
