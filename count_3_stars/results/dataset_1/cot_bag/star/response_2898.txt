Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 
  - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <0, (2, 4, 5)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 
  - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 
  - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 4)>

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 
  - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  - 3-stars: <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 5)>, <3, (6, 7, 5)>, <3, (7, 8, 5)>, <3, (7, 8, 5)>, <3, (7, 6, 5)>

- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 
  - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
  - 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (1, 8, 9)>, <4, (8, 9, 3)>, <4, (8, 9, 3)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 8, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 5)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 5)>, <4, (3, 8, 5)>, <4, (3, 8, 5)>, <4, (3, 7, 5)>, <4, (3, 8, 5)>

- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 
  - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 6, 5)>, <7, (3, 6, 5)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 
  - Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
  - 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 9)>

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 41

Thus, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [41].
