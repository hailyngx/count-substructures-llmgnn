Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 3.
- Node 2 is connected to node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3: It has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: It has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 10 + 1] = [21] \).

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 3)>, <0, (1, 8, 3)>, <0, (1, 9, 3)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 3, 8)>, <0, (4, 3, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>.

So, the final answer is \( [21] \).
