Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: {(0,3), (0,4), (0,6), (1,9), (3,0), (4,0), (4,5), (4,7), (5,4), (5,6), (5,8), (6,0), (6,5), (7,4), (8,5), (9,1)}

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has neighbors {3, 4, 6} forming 1 3-star.
Node 4 has neighbors {0, 5, 7} forming 1 3-star.
Node 5 has neighbors {4, 6, 8} forming 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1] = [3]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3.
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <5, (4, 6, 8)>.
