Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 15

So, the final answer is: [15]
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 8)>
