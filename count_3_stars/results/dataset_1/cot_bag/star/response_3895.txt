Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 7 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, we get a total of 55 3-stars.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 4, 7)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (7, 9, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [55].
