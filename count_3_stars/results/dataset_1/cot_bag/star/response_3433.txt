Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph:

```
0 --- 2 --- 6 --- 9
|     |     |
|     |     |
1 --- 3     7
|     |     |
|     |     |
4     8 --- 5
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 7), (1, 8) - forms 1 3-star
Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 6) - forms 3 3-stars
Node 6: (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 9) - forms 3 3-stars
Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 9) - forms 3 3-stars
Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 4), (8, 5) - forms 3 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 3)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 9, 3)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (1, 5, 4)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 1, 5)>
