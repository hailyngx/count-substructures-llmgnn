Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The provided graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 6
- Node 1: 0, 2, 7
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 5, 7
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 4
- Node 7: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 7

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it can form inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 = 5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <1, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 3, 9)>
