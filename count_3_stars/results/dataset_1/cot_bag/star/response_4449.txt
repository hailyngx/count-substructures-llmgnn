Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 3: 8
- Node 4: 8, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8, 9
- Node 6: 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 4, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (exactly 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

There are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph, which we will represent inside brackets.
So, the total number of 3-stars is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (1, 4, 5)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
