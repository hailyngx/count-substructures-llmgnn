Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's first draw the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 4, and 5: <2, (0, 4, 5)>
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 6, and 7: <9, (3, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
