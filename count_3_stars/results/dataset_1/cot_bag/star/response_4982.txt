Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph:
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to node 4.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 6, 7, and 8.

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 6), forming \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 9), forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 6), forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9), forming \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8), forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

The total number of 3-star configurations is 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (4, 6, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
