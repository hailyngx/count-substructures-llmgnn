Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 (total 6 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2 (total 3 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 3, 9 (total 3 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 5, 7 (total 3 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

1. For node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
2. For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3. For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
4. For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 23 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <2, (0, 4, 6)>
- <2, (0, 4, 7)>
- <2, (0, 4, 9)>
- <2, (0, 6, 7)>
- <2, (0, 6, 9)>
- <2, (0, 7, 9)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 9)>
- <2, (1, 6, 7)>
- <2, (1, 6, 9)>
- <2, (1, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <2, (4, 6, 9)>
- <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- <1, (2, 4, 6)>
- <1, (2, 4, 7)>
- <1, (2, 4, 9)>
