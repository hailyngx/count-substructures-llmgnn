Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 8
- Node 1: 4
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 8
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4, 7
- Node 9: 3, 7

From the list above, we see that only Node 0, Node 3, Node 8, and Node 9 have at least 3 neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4 + 0] = 9 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 8)>
- <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (3, 4, 7)>
