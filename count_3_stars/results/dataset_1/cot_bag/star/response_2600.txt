Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: {7, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {2, 4}
- Node 2: {1, 4, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {1, 2, 6, 8}
- Node 5: {7}
- Node 6: {2, 4, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 5}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4}
- Node 9: {0, 6}

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 0: [1 3-star]
- Node 2: [2 3-stars]
- Node 4: [2 3-stars]
- Node 6: [1 3-star]

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 2 + 2 + 1] = [6]

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, 7, 8, 9>
- <2, 1, 4, 8>
- <2, 4, 6, 8>
