Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we can represent it visually as follows:

```
  0 --- 2 --- 5 --- 7
  |     |     |     |
  3 --- 1 --- 4 --- 9
           |
           6 --- 8
```

Following the instructions, we will now count the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 4 neighbors, forming \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 1, 2)>, <0, (6, 2, 7)>, <0, (7, 5, 9)>

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, exactly forming 1 3-star.
<1, (2, 3, 4)>

Node 2 has 6 neighbors, forming \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 1, 0)>, <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <2, (3, 8, 6)>, <2, (4, 1, 6)>, <2, (4, 9, 7)>, <2, (5, 1, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 0)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 7, 0)>, <2, (6, 0, 5)>, <2, (6, 4, 1)>, <2, (6, 5, 7)>

Node 3 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (0, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 0, 2)>, <3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (2, 0, 6)>, <3, (2, 1, 4)>, <3, (2, 6, 8)>, <3, (6, 0, 2)>, <3, (8, 2, 6)>

Node 4 has 3 neighbors, exactly forming 1 3-star.
<4, (1, 6, 9)>

Node 5 has 3 neighbors, exactly forming 1 3-star.
<5, (2, 6, 7)>

Node 6 has 5 neighbors, forming \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 6)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 0, 5)>, <6, (2, 1, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 0, 6)>, <6, (5, 0, 7)>, <6, (7, 0, 9)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors, exactly forming 1 3-star.
<7, (0, 5, 9)>

Node 8 has 2 neighbors, forming 0 3-stars.

Node 9 has 2 neighbors, forming 0 3-stars.
 
The total number of 3-stars is 4 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 20 (from node 2) + 10 (from node 3) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) + 10 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 7) + 0 (from node 8) + 0 (from node 9) = 48

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [48].
