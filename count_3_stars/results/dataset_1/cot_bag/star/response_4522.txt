Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

```
    0 --- 3 --- 4 --- 8 --- 2
    |     |           |     
    7     6           9 
    |     |           
    1     5
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and determine the 3-stars formed: 

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 7, 3, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 9, 0), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (3, 8, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with these nodes.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 5, so we put this number inside brackets: [5].

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 7, 3)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (3, 8, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
