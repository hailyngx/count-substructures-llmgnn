Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes (0, 3, 6, 8, 9) with 3 or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 20 = 24.

Therefore, there are [24] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 5)>
<3, (4, 6, 1)>
<3, (6, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<6, (1, 9, 0)>
<6, (1, 9, 5)>
<6, (1, 9, 0)>
<6, (2, 4, 1)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 1)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 1)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 1)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>
<6, (4, 3, 5)>
<6, (4, 3, 8)>
<6, (4, 3, 5)>
<6, (4, 3, 1)>
<6, (4, 3, 5)>
<6, (4, 3, 1)>
<6, (4, 3, 5)>
