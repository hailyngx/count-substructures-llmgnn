Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {2, 3, 5}
- Node 1: {2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {0, 1, 5, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 4: {5}
- Node 5: {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: {2, 3, 5, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 8}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 6, 7}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 2: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 3: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10
Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4] = 43

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (2, 3, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 5)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 3, 6)>
