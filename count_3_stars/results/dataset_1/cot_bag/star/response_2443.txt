Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. From the given edges, the node-neighbors configuration is as follows:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 9
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 4, 6
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 4, 5
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 20] = 21 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <4, (0, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
