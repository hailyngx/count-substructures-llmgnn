Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll examine each node that has three or more neighbors. 
From the given information:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 8
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with more than three neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 7) + 4 (from node 8) = 12

Therefore, there are 12 3-star subgraphs in the given graph. Represented uniquely, they are:
