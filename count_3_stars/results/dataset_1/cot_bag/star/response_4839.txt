Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we can start by examining each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8. So, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 8. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 6. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 7. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 5, 6. So, it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 9. So, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 8. So, it forms 1 3-star.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
<7, (2, 5, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
