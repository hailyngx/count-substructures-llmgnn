Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as a list of nodes and their neighbors:

- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 4, 6
- Node 2: 0, 7
- Node 4: 0, 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 4
- Node 9: 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- For Node 0: 4 neighbors, so we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- For Node 4: 4 neighbors, so we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (1, 6, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 0)>
- For Node 6: 5 neighbors, so we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>

Total 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [18].
