Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{1}{3} = 0
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 4 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (8, 5, 9)>
<4, (9, 0, 5)>
<4, (9, 8, 5)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (4, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 5)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (4, 0, 5)>
<9, (4, 8, 5)>
