Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 3, 6, 7
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3
- Node 6: 0, 1, 3
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8, 9
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 7

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of [12] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>
