Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 3, 6
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node and find the total:
- Node 0: [1]
- Node 1: [1]
- Node 2: [1]
- Node 3: [1]
- Node 4: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: [1]
- Node 6: [1]
- Node 7: [1]
- Node 8: [1]
- Node 9: No 3-stars (has less than 3 neighbors)

The total number of 3-stars is [6].

The unique 3-stars formed are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<2, (3, 1, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 7, 0)>
<6, (0, 1, 4)>
