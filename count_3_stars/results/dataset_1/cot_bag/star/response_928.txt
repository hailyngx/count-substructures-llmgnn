Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's determine the nodes that have at least three neighbors:
- Node 1 has 8 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 56 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 68 \]

So, there are a total of 68 3-stars in the graph. 

Listing the unique 3-stars:
\[ [<1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)> \] 

\[ <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)> \]

Putting the final number inside brackets: 
\[ [68] \]
