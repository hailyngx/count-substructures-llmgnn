Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
From the given information, the nodes are labeled from 0 to 9, and the edges are listed. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For node 4: Since it only has 2 neighbors, it does not form any 3-star.
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: \[ [ 1 + 4 + 4 ] = 9 \]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

- <0, (2, 5, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (3, 9, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 9)>
- <9, (2, 7, 4)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>

So, the final answer is: \[ [ 9 ] = 9 \]
