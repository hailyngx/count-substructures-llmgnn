Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
Using the formula \( inom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 2 has \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has \( inom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 10] = [55] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>

<2, (6, 8, 9)>
