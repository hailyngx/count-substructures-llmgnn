Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we'll first create a visual representation of the graph based on the given edges:

```
   0 ---- 2 ---- 8
 / |       |       |
5  |       |       |
 \ |       |       |
   9 ---- 1 ---- 7
          |      / \
          |     /   \
          6    3 ---- 4
               |     |
               ------
```

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 6 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

- For nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6, each with 3 neighbors:
  - 1 3-star

- For nodes 2 and 7, each with 4 neighbors:
  - ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars

- For nodes 3, with 4 neighbors:
  - ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars

- Node 9 has 6 neighbors:
  - ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 33, and we can list the unique 3-stars:
[33]
<0, 2, 5, 9> <1, 6, 7, 9> <3, 4, 7, 9> <9, 0, 1, 3>
