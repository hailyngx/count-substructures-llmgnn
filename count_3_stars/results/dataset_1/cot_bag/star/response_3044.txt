Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:
```

          0 ---- 5
        / |     / |
       9  1    2  |
                |  6
                4 / 
              / |/
             3- 7
               /
              8 
```

Now we will count the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: has 2 neighbors (5, 9)
- Node 1: has 1 neighbor (5)
- Node 2: has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 6) 
  - Total 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
  - Unique 3-stars: <2, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 3: has 2 neighbors (4, 7)
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 6, 7)
  - Total 3-stars: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
  - Unique 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4)
  - Total 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
  - Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 2)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 9)
  - Total 3-stars: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
  - Unique 3-stars: <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 7)>
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 6)
  - Total 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
  - Unique 3-stars: <7, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 8: has 1 neighbor (9)
- Node 9: has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8)
  - Total 3-stars: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
  - Unique 3-stars: <9, (0, 6, 8)>

Adding up the total number of unique 3-stars, we get a total of 17 3-stars in this graph. So, the answer is [17].
