Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 1), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 1), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has neighbors {4, 5, 8, 9}.
It forms 1 3-star: <1, (4, 8, 9)>.

Node 5 has neighbors {0, 1, 2, 7, 9}.
It forms 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 7)>.

Node 7 has neighbors {3, 5, 6}.
It forms 1 3-star: <7, (3, 6, 5)>.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3].
