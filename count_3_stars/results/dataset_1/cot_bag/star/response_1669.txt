Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors. Let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors first:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8
Node 1: 0, 9
Node 2: 5, 9
Node 3: 5
Node 4: 0, 5, 9
Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 6: 5
Node 8: 0, 9
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 19 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].
