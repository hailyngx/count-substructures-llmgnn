Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 4, 5, 6, 3, 9, 8.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars with node 5 as the center.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center.

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [30]

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 3, 7)>
