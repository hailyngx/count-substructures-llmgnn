Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and their connections can be visualized as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 8, 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0: Forms 1 3-star <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star <1, (0, 9, 4)>
- Node 4: Forms 1 3-star <4, (0, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star <8, (2, 4, 9)>
- Node 9: Forms 1 3-star <9, (1, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].
