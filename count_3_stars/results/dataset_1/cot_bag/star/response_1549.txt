Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph by examining each node with three or more neighbors.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4] = [34] \)

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 7, 3)>
<1, (0, 7, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 6)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (5, 7, 8)>
