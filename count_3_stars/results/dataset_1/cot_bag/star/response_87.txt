Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

Here are the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 10 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 10.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 6)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
