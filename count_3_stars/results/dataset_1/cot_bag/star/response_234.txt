Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 2
- Node 8: 0, 5, 9
- Node 9: 1, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

We see that nodes 0, 8, and 9 each form one 3-star. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 3, which we represent as [3].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, 4, 7>
- <8, 5, 9>
- <9, 1, 7>
