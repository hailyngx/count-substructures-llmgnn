Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and see how many 3-stars can be formed with them.

- Node 1 has neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8} - we can form 4 3-stars
- Node 2 has neighbors {1, 3, 7} - we can form 1 3-star
- Node 4 has neighbors {1, 5, 7} - we can form 1 3-star
- Node 5 has neighbors {1, 4, 9} - we can form 1 3-star
- Node 8 has neighbors {1, 9} - we cannot form any 3-stars
- Node 9 has neighbors {5, 8} - we cannot form any 3-stars

Thus, in total, there are 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 3-stars in this graph. Finally, the total number of 3-stars is [7], and the unique 3-stars found are <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 9, 8)>.
