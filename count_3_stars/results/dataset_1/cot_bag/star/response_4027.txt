Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are a few nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of those nodes.

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5):
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (4, 3, 5)>

2. Node 2 has 5 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 8, 9):
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   - Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>

3. Node 4 has 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7, 8):
   - Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)   
   - Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: \( 4 + 10 + 10 = 24 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].
