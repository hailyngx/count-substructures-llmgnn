Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph representation for better visualization:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 5
- 1 is connected to 3, 7, 9
- 2 is connected to 3, 5, 8
- 3 is connected to 1, 2, 6
- 5 is connected to 0, 2
- 6 is connected to 3, 7
- 7 is connected to 1, 6
- 8 is connected to 2
- 9 is connected to 1

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 3, and 6.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed:

Node 1:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<1, (3, 7, 9)>

Node 2:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
<2, (3, 5, 8)>

Node 3:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
<3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>

Node 6:
\[ \binom{2}{3} = 0 \]

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 0 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
