Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 5
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 2, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 3, 6
- Node 8: 0, 4
- Node 9: 0, 3, 4, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. 
   Therefore, we have 4 3-stars: 
   <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <0, (3, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>

2. Node 3 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars similar to Node 0's.
   Therefore, we have 4 3-stars: 
   <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (7, 0, 9)>, <3, (7, 2, 9)>

3. Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars similar to Node 0's.
   Therefore, we have 4 3-stars: 
   <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 9)>

Putting all the 3-stars together, we have a total of 12 3-stars listed above.
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [12].
