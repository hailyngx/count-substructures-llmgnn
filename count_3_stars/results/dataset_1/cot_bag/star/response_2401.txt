Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 8), 
(1, 3), (1, 4), 
(2, 5), (2, 7), (2, 9), 
(3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 9), 
(4, 1), (4, 8), 
(5, 2), 
(7, 2), (7, 3), 
(8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 9), 
(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 8)

To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will calculate \( \text{inom}{n}{3} \) for each node with three or more neighbors:

1. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: Node 5, Node 7, Node 9
   Number of 3-stars with Node 2 as the center: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <2, (5, 7, 9)>

2. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: Node 1, Node 7, Node 9
   Number of 3-stars with Node 3 as the center: \( \text{inom}{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <3, (1, 7, 9)>

[The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2]
