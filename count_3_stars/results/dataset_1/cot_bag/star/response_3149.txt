Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 25

So, there are 25 different 3-stars in this graph: 
<[0, 1, 4]>, <[0, 1, 6]>, <[0, 1, 7]>, <[0, 1, 8]>, <[1, 2, 4]>, <[1, 4, 6]>, <[1, 4, 7]>, <[1, 4, 8]>, <[2, 3, 4]>, <[4, 6, 7]>, <[4, 6, 8]>, <[4, 7, 8]>, <[6, 7, 8]>, <[0, 4, 6]>, <[0, 4, 7]>, <[0, 4, 8]>, <[0, 6, 8]>, <[0, 7, 8]>, <[1, 4, 5]>, <[2, 1, 0]>, <[2, 1, 5]>, <[2, 1, 8]>, <[2, 3, 2]>, <[7, 8, 6]>, <[7, 8, 9]> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [25].
