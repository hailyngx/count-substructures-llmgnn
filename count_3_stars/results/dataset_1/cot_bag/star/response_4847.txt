Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, and 8
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, and 6
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 7

Next, let's find the 3-stars:
Considering each node:
- Node 0: No 3-stars can be formed (has only 2 neighbors).
- Node 1: Creates 1 3-star: <1, (3, 6, 9)>.
- Node 2: Creates 1 3-star: <2, (5, 6, 7)>.
- Node 3: Creates 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 8)>.
- Node 4: No 3-stars can be formed (has only 2 neighbors).
- Node 5: Creates 1 3-star: <5, (0, 2, 4)>.
- Node 6: Creates 1 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 8)>.
- Node 7: No 3-stars can be formed (has only 2 neighbors).
- Node 8: Creates 3 3-stars: <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>.
- Node 9: No 3-stars can be formed (has only 2 neighbors).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3] = 9.

Thus, the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<2, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<3, (0, 1, 8)>, 
<5, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<6, (1, 2, 8)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<8, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<8, (4, 5, 6)>.
