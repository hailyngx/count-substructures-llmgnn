Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges:
- 0 is connected to 3, 5, 7
- 2 is connected to 6
- 3 is connected to 0, 8
- 4 is connected to 7
- 5 is connected to 0
- 6 is connected to 2, 7
- 7 is connected to 0, 4, 6
- 8 is connected to 3, 9
- 9 is connected to 8

Next, we'll identify the nodes that are the centers of 3-star graphs. Nodes with 3 or more neighbors can potentially form 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 8

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0:  inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3:  inom{2}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7:  inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 8:  inom{1}{3} = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 7) = 2
Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 6)>
