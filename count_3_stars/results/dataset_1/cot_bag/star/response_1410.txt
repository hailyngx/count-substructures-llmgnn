Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 6
- Node 8: 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 8, which can be represented as [8].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <6, (0, 7, 8)>
- <7, (0, 2, 5)>
- <7, (0, 5, 6)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 9)>
