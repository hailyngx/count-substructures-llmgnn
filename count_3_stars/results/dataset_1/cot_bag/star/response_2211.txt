Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges as described. 

The graph is as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 2.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.

Next, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:
- Node 2: Connected to 5 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 8, 0).
- Node 3: Connected to 5 neighbors (7, 8, 1, 0, 5).
- Node 8: Connected to 6 neighbors (7, 9, 1, 2, 3, 5).

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 20 = 40 

The final answer is [40].

Unique 3-stars found:
<2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 7, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <8, (3, 7, 9)>
