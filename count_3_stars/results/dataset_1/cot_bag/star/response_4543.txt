Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 0, 1, 5, 8
- Node 4: 1, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8
- Node 6: 8
- Node 7: 0, 4, 9
- Node 8: 2, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 0, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 21 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [21], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>, 
<4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (2, 4, 8)>,<8, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<8, (4, 6, 5)>, <8, (4, 6, 8)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 7)>
