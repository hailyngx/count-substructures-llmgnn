Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 20 edges, we can list the nodes with their neighbors to analyze the 3-stars:

- Node 0: Neighbors {1}
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 7, 8}
- Node 2: Neighbors {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: Neighbors {8}
- Node 4: Neighbors {2, 6}
- Node 5: Neighbors {6}
- Node 6: Neighbors {2, 4, 5, 8}
- Node 7: Neighbors {1, 2}
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 3, 6}

Following the criteria stated, we examine each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 2: Forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: Forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: Forms 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7 \)

Putting the final number inside brackets: \[ 7 \]

Listing the unique 3-stars found:
- <1, 0, 1, 7>
- <2, 2, 4, 6>
- <6, 2, 4, 5>
- <6, 2, 5, 6>
- <6, 4, 2, 5>
- <6, 4, 5, 6>
- <6, 5, 6, 8>
