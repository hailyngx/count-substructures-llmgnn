Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: Since node 0 has 5 neighbors, the total number of 3-stars involving node 0 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 2: Node 2 also has 5 neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars involving node 2 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 4: Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star involving node 4.
- Node 6: Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars involving node 6 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 7: Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so the total number of 3-stars involving node 7 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- Node 9: Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is only 1 3-star involving node 9.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 42. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph would be [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, and <2, (0, 3, 7)>.
