Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9. 

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 41

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41].

And the unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<1, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<2, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<3, (0, 2, 4)>, 
<4, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<5, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<9, (1, 4, 7)>.
