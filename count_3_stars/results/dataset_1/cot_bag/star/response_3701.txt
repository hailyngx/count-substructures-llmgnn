Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 9.

For node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
For node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 12

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 9, 5)>
<4, (5, 9, 1)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 1, 5)>
<1, (2, 9, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
