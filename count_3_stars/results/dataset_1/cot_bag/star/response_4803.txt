Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: node 5, node 8, node 9, and node 1. We will calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes forms:

1. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8. So, it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
2. Node 8 has 2 neighbors: nodes 3 and 5. So, it cannot form any 3-star.
3. Node 9 has 2 neighbors: nodes 6 and 7. So, it cannot form any 3-star.
4. Node 1 has 1 neighbor: node 5. So, it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of 4 (from node 5) = 4.

Putting the final number inside brackets []: [4]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
