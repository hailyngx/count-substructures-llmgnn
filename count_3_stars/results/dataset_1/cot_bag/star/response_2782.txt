Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The total number of 3-stars can be calculated as follows:

- Node 0 has neighbors (5, 6, 7, 8), forming inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 has neighbors (1, 3, 4, 6, 7), forming inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 5 has neighbors (0, 9), forming inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
- Node 6 has neighbors (0, 2, 3), forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has neighbors (0, 2, 9), forming inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Adding these up gives a total of 16 3-stars, which can be represented as:

\[ [16] \]

The unique 3-stars are:

\[ <0, (5, 6, 7)> <2, (1, 3, 4)> <2, (1, 3, 6)> <2, (1, 3, 7)> <2, (1, 4, 6)> <2, (1, 4, 7)> <2, (1, 6, 7)> <2, (3, 4, 6)> <2, (3, 4, 7)> <2, (3, 6, 7)> <2, (4, 6, 7)> <6, (0, 5, 9)> <7, (0, 6, 9)> <7, (0, 7, 9)> <7, (5, 6, 9)> <7, (5, 7, 9)> \]
