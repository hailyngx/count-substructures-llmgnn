Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and 40 edges as described:

         0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 9
         |         |
         3 -- 8    5
         |         |
         9    4 -- 7
                 |
                 6

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph and list them:

- Node 1 forms 1 3-star: <1, (0, 3, 9)>
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 5, 8)>
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star: <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star: <9, (0, 2, 5)>

Now, counting the total number of 3-stars, we have 6 in total. Thus, the final answer is [6].
