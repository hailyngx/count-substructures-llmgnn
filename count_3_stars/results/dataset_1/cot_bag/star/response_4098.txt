Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The edges are: {(0, 3), (0, 7), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 9), (7, 9)}

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 4, 6

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up, we have a total of 5 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is  [5].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, and <5, (1, 4, 6)>.
