Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 9)
- Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 8)
- Node 3: (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6)
- Node 4: (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9)
- Node 5: (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)
- Node 6: (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7)
- Node 7: (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8)
- Node 8: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 9)
- Node 9: (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 1 = 41

So, the total number of 3-stars is [41].

The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
