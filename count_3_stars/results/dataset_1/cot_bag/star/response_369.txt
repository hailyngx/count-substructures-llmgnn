Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (1, 8)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 5)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 6)
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (1, 8)

We can calculate the total number of 3-stars as follows:
- Node 0 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 contributes \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is 35, which we will represent as [35].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, 
<1, (4, 6, 9)>, 
<3, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 5)>,
<6, (0, 4, 7)>,
<6, (0, 5, 7)>,
<6, (0, 4, 8)>,
<6, (0, 5, 8)>,
<6, (4, 5, 7)>,
<6, (4, 5, 8)>,
<6, (5, 7, 8)>,
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
