Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, first, we need to identify any nodes with three or more neighbors since these nodes can potentially form 3-stars. 

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed from each eligible node:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 2) + 1 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 8) = 7 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [7].

List of unique 3-stars found: 
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 5, 8)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <5, (2, 4, 8)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
