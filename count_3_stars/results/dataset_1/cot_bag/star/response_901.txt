Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to node 0
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 8
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3 and 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 1)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <5, (1, 3, 8)>, <5, (0, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 8, 0)>, <5, (0, 1, 3)>
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars: <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 9, 2)>, <7, (2, 1, 3)>

Counting the total 3-stars, we have 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 3-stars in total. So the final answer is [17].
