Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges can be represented as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 0), (6, 4), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 5), (9, 3), (9, 5)

Now let's identify the 3-star structures in this graph:

Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 6), (0, 7) => [1]
<0, (2, 6, 7)>

Node 1: (1, 2), (1, 7) => [1]
<1, (2, 7)>

Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 1) => [1]
<2, (0, 1)>

Node 3: (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9) => [4]
<3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (8, 4, 9)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 4: (4, 3), (4, 6) => [1]
<4, (3, 6)>

Node 5: (5, 8), (5, 9) => [1]
<5, (8, 9)>

Node 6: (6, 0), (6, 4) => [1]
<6, (0, 4)>

Node 7: (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3) => [1]
<7, (0, 1, 3)>

Node 8: (8, 3), (8, 5) => [1]
<8, (3, 5)>

Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 5) => [1]
<9, (3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10].
