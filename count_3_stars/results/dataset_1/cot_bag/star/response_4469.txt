Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now let's find the 3-star structures in this graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 7), so it can form 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 5)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6), so it can form 4 3-stars: <1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5), so it can form 4 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 5)>, <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3), so it can form 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 3)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (2, 8), so it can form 1 3-star: <9, (2, 8, 9)>

Adding up the 3-stars, we get a total of [4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 18 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].
