Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 3, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 29. 

Therefore, we have found 29 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:

<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)> 

So, the final answer is [29].
