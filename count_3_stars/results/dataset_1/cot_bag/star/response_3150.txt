Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Degree: 6)
- Node 2: 4, 7 (Degree: 2)
- Node 3: 6, 7, 9 (Degree: 3)
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6 (Degree: 5)
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 8 (Degree: 4)
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 5 (Degree: 4)
- Node 7: 1, 2, 3, 8 (Degree: 4)
- Node 8: 1, 5, 7 (Degree: 3)
- Node 9: 0, 3 (Degree: 2)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each node with degree 3 or more:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 44

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].
