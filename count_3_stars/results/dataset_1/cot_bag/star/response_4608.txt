Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form. 

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 \). 

Inside brackets [], the total number of 3-stars is [8].

Listing the unique 3-stars found inside <>:
- <0, 1, 6, 7>
- <1, 0, 6, 7>
- <1, 2, 3, 9>
- <1, 6, 0, 7>
- <1, 7, 0, 6>
- <2, 1, 3, 9>
- <3, 1, 2, 9>
- <6, 0, 1, 7>
