Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 2), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 5), (3, 8), (3, 9), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 7), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 7)

Now, let's determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0 is connected to node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to node 5.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 3.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 9.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: 1 3-star {<2, (0, 5)>}
- For node 3: 1 3-star {<3, (8, 9)>}
- For node 5: 1 3-star {<5, (1, 2, 7)>}
- For node 7: 1 3-star {<7, (5, 9)>}
- For node 9: 1 3-star {<9, (3, 7, 9)>}

Putting the total number of 3-stars in brackets: [5]
