Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be represented as follows:

```
   0 -- 4 -- 1 -- 9
   |              |
   7              3
   |              |
   8 -- 2 -- 5 -- 6
```

From the given graph, we can see that nodes 0, 2, and 4 have 3 or more neighbors, which allows them to form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has neighbors 4, 7, and 8, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 2 has neighbors 4, 5, and 6, so it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has neighbors 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8, so it can form inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 20] = 22.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, and <4, (0, 1, 5)>.
