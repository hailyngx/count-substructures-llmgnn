Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 9
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 7, 9
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 7, 8
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 0, 4
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 9
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8

Calculating the 3-stars based on the formula mentioned earlier:
Node 0 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 3 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 4 forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
Node 8 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
Node 9 forms [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 14

So, the final answer is [14]. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 6)>
<0, (2, 3, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 0, 4)>
<3, (2, 8, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (6, 0, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
