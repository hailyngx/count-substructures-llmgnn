Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 3, 5}
- Node 2: neighbors {3, 4, 9}
- Node 3: neighbors {0, 1, 2, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {3, 7, 8}
- Node 8: neighbors {6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (3, 7, 8)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
