Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: has neighbors 2, 6, 8 (degree 3)
- Node 2: has neighbors 0, 4, 6 (degree 3)
- Node 4: has neighbors 1, 2, 5, 8, 9 (degree 5)
- Node 5: has neighbors 3, 4, 7 (degree 3)
- Node 6: has neighbors 0, 2, 3 (degree 3)
- Node 7: has neighbors 1, 5, 9 (degree 3)
- Node 8: has neighbors 0, 4 (degree 2)
- Node 9: has neighbors 4, 7 (degree 2)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [15] \).
The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>
