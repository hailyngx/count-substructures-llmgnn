Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in the graph:
1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 8, 9
3. Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7
4. Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 6, 8, 9
5. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 9
6. Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 0, 7
7. Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4
8. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5
9. Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 3
10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 4

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0, 1, 4, and 6 each can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 and 9 can each form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 10.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)> 

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
