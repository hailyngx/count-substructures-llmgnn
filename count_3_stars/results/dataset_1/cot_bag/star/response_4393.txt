Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 2) (5, 7) (7, 5) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to node 2.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 1 (from node 4) = 3 3-stars in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 8)>
- <4, (0, 1, 2)>
