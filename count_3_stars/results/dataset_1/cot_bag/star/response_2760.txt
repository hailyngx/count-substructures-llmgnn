Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 3), (0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 1), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 3), (8, 6), (9, 3), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 3, 6

Number of 3-stars formed with node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
Number of 3-stars formed with node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars in the graph: 20 + 4 = 24

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (0, 1, 4)>
<3, (0, 1, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (4, 7, 8)>
<3, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
