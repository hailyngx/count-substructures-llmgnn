Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges based on the information provided:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9

Edges:
(0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 3)
(5, 0), (5, 6), (6, 2), (6, 5), (8, 3), (9, 0)

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Nodes 2, 3, and 6 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of them:

For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Therefore, the final answer is [3] and the unique 3-stars are:
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
