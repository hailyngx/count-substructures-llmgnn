Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 8)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 6, 9)
- Node 2: 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 8)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (nodes 6, 9)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 6, 8)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (nodes 6, 7, 9)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 4, 5)
- Node 7: 1 neighbor (node 5)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 4)
- Node 9: 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 5)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>
Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <4, (1, 6, 8)>
Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <5, (6, 7, 9)>
Node 6 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>
Node 8 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 4)>
Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 5)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = [12] 3-stars in this graph.
