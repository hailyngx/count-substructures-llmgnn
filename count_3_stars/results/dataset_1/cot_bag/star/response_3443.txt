Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first draw the graph based on the given information:

```
   0 ---- 1 ---- 2
         /  \   /
        4    7---5
       /      \ |
      6        \|      
               3
```

Based on the graph, we can see that node 1, 2, 4, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [7] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- \<1, (0, 2, 4)\>
- \<1, (0, 4, 6)\>
- \<1, (2, 4, 7)\>
- \<1, (4, 7, 5)\>
- \<2, (1, 4, 7)\>
- \<4, (1, 0, 7)\>
- \<7, (1, 2, 5)\>
