Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 6)
- Node 1: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4)
- Node 2: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7)
- Node 3: 2 neighbors (1, 2)
- Node 4: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 5)
- Node 5: 2 neighbors (0, 4)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 7: 2 neighbors (2, 6)
- Node 9: 1 neighbor (6)

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 4, and 6 have three or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

- Node 0: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4: \(C(3, 3) = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6: \(C(4, 3) = 4\) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13]. The unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 7)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6,(4, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 6, 7)>
<6, (1, 6, 9)>
