Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's first construct the graph by listing the nodes and their connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.

Now, we can identify the nodes with the number of neighbors they have:
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors.

We will now calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 10] = 30 \).

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (0, 1, 5)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 8)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 1)>, <4, (3, 1, 5)>, <4, (3, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 1, 5)>, <4, (2, 1, 7)>
