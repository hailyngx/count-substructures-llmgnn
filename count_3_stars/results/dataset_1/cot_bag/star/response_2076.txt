Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed around them.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 7. So we can form 1 3-star around node 0.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8. So we can form 1 3-star around node 1.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8, 9. So we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 2.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6. So we can form 1 3-star around node 4.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7. So we can form 1 3-star around node 6.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 6, 9. So we can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars around node 7.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors and cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 = 23. So the answer is [23].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (2, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 6)>
- <7, (0, 1, 9)>
