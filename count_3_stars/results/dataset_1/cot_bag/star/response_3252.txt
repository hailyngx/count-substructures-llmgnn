Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 4, 8)
- Node 2: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (3, 4, 8)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (2, 4, 7, 8, 9)
- Node 7: 5 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: 5 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 9: 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 8)

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars formed by these nodes: 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 50

Therefore, the total number of unique 3-stars in the graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<6, (2, 7, 8)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
