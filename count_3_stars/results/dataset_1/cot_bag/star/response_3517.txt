Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 6, 7
- Node 1: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 1, 3
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars is 6, and we can represent them as:
\[ [6] \]
Unique 3-stars: <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 1)>
