Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

0: 4, 5, 6
1: 8
2: 3, 5, 9
3: 2, 7, 8
4: 0, 5
5: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
6: 0, 5, 9
7: 3, 8
8: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
9: 2, 5, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 + 4 = 37 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 5, 6>
<2, 3, 5, 9>
<3, 5, 7, 8>
<5, 6, 8, 9>
<5, 8, 9>
<8, 9, 2>
