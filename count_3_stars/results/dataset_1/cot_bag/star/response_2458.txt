Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, and 9.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, and 5.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
