Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's analyze the nodes that have three or more neighbors to see if they can form any 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 7
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 9
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: Only 1 3-star with node 4
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: Only 1 3-star with node 8

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 4) + 4 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) = 26

Therefore, the final answer is [26] and the unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>.
