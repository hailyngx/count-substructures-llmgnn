Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 3, 5, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2
- Node 4: 0, 1
- Node 5: 0, 2, 7
- Node 6: 7, 8
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 0, 6
- Node 9: 2

Based on the number of neighbors each node has, we have:
- 8 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- 2 nodes with exactly 2 neighbors: nodes 3, 9

Calculating the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
\( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 7 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars is [7]. 

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 4, 5)>
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <0, (1, 5, 8)>
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (0, 4, 5)>
- <2, (3, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
