Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. 
The 3-stars involving node 3 are: 
<3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>

Node 4 also has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8. So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
The 3-stars involving node 4 are: 
<4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 3)>, <4, (5, 3, 8)>, <4, (6, 3, 8)>, <4, (6, 3, 5)>, <4, (6, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>

There are a total of \(10 + 10 = 20\) 3-stars in this graph, which we represent inside brackets as [20].

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (1, 4, 5)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (1, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 3)>, <4, (5, 3, 8)>, <4, (6, 3, 8)>, <4, (6, 3, 5)>, <4, (6, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>
