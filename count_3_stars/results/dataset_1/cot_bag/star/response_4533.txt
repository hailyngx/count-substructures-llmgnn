Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 5 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 3 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

No other nodes qualify as they either have less than 3 neighbors or exactly 3 neighbors. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 10 (from node 0) + 10 (from node 9) = 20. 

Thus, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<0, (1, 6, 9)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>
<9, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (6, 8, 9)>
