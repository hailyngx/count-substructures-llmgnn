Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the provided edges, we can construct the graph as follows:
```
0 --- 2
|\   /|
| \ / |
|  3  |
| / \ |
|/   \|
4     7 --- 6 --- 8 --- 1 --- 9
``` 

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Let's find the 3-stars:   

- Node 0: has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 7), so 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 7)>   

- Node 1: has 4 neighbors (4, 7, 8, 9), so 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4   
<1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>   

- Node 3: has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9), so 3-stars = 1   
<3, (0, 2, 9)>   

- Node 4: has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 9), so 3-stars = 1   
<4, (0, 1, 9)>   

- Node 6: has 3 neighbors (7, 8, 9), so 3-stars = 1   
<6, (7, 8, 9)>   

In total, there are 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 3-stars.   
Therefore, the final answer is [11].
