Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9.

The nodes and their connections are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 5, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 0, 3, and 4
- Node 3 is connected to Node 2
- Node 4 is connected to Node 2
- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 1, 6, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to Node 5
- Node 8 is connected to Node 1
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 1 and 5

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 5, 8, and 9. So, we have 1 3-star with Node 1.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].

The single 3-star in this graph is <1, (5, 8, 9)>.
