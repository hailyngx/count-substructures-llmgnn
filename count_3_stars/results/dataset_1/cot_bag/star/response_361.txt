Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (6, 0) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

By analyzing the given edges, we can determine the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 3, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 4
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1
- Node 4 has neighbors: 2, 8
- Node 6 has neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 4
- Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 6, 7

Now, we can find the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 3-stars with neighbors {2, 3, 8}, {2, 6, 9}, {3, 7, 9}
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with neighbors {2, 3, 9}
- Node 2 forms a 3-star with neighbors {0, 1, 4}
- Node 9 forms a 3-star with neighbors {1, 6, 7}

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 9)>, <0, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 9)>.
