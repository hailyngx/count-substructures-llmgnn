Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 6
- Node 2: 0, 4, 7
- Node 3: 7
- Node 4: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 2, 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 6, 7
- Node 9: 4

From this information, we can see that only nodes 0, 2, and 4 have three or more neighbors, and thus have the potential to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Thus, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>
