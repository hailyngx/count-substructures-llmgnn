Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 1 and Node 7 have only 1 neighbor each, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 8 has no neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed.

Therefore, there is 1 total 3-star in the graph. 

Putting the final number inside brackets gives us [1].

The unique 3-star found in the graph is <9, (0, 5, 9)>.
