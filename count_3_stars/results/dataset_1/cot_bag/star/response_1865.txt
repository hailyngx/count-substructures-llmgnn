Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

For each of these nodes, let's calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:

Node 0: No 3-stars (2 neighbors only)
Node 2: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>
Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star <4, (5, 8, 9)>
Node 5: No 3-stars (3 neighbors only)
Node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>
Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>
Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>
Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>

Total number of 3-stars: [0 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21]. 
The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 6, 5)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 9)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>.
