Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 4, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4
- Node 8: 0, 1
- Node 9: 5

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 20 = 40

Therefore, there are a total of [40] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 4, 7)>
<0, (6, 5, 7)>
<0, (6, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 7, 3)>
<2, (5, 4, 6)>
<2, (5, 4, 7)>
<4, (5, 0, 6)>
<4, (5, 2, 6)>
<4, (6, 0, 2)>
<4, (6, 2, 0)>
