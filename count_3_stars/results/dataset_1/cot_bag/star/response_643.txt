Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5
- Node 1: 0, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 7, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 1, 5
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 1
- Node 9: 1, 4, 5

We see that nodes 1, 4, and 5 each have 3 or more neighbors, so they can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:

- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 4] = 18 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (1, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 3, 9)>
<4, (3, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (1, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
