Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors, which are nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Unique 3-star: <0, (4, 5, 8)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, and 7.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 3)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (1, 3, 7)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- Unique 3-star: <6, (1, 2, 8)>

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (2, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 14
So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [14].
