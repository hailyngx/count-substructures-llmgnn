Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
Node 0: 1, 3, 5
Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8
Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 9
Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
Node 4: 3, 5, 8, 9
Node 5: 0, 1, 4
Node 6: 2, 3, 8
Node 7: 1, 8
Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 7
Node 9: 2, 3, 4

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
Node 0: [1]
Node 1: [1]
Node 2: [1]
Node 3: [1]
Node 4: [1]
Node 5: [1]
Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 7: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 8: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 9: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 3)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<3, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
