Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we calculate the 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 1 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 3 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 4 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 5 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 can form 0 3-stars
- Node 7 can form 0 3-stars
- Node 8 can form 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars
- Node 9 can form 0 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 42.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars are:
