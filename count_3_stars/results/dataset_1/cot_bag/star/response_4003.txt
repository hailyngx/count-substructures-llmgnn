Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
(0, 6), (0, 9), 
(1, 2), (1, 7), 
(2, 1), (2, 5), 
(3, 4), 
(4, 3), (4, 6), 
(5, 2), 
(6, 0), (6, 4), 
(7, 1), 
(9, 0)

Now, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors so we can calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 4, 6}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [7].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 9)>
<1, (2, 7)>
<2, (1, 5)>
<4, (3, 6)>
<6, (0, 4)>
