Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we need to consider each node and its neighbors.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 8.
Node 8 has 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: \( 10 + 4 + 20 = 34 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (1, 4, 7)>
<8, (1, 5, 7)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
