Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with the specified nodes and edges.  

Given edges:
(0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1)

By examining the edge list, we can visualize the graph as:

```
        0 --- 2 --- 3
        |     |      
        9     6     
              |
              7 -- 5
              |
              1
```

Now, we will identify the nodes that are part of 3-stars and calculate the number of unique 3-stars.

Nodes with at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 5

Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} \) = 1

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us: `[1]`

Unique 3-star found: <2, (0, 6, 7)>
