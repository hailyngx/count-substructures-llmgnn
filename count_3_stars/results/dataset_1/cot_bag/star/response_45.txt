Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 7, 9
- Node 1: 5, 6, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 4: 2, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 6, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 5
- Node 7: 0, 4, 5
- Node 8: 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 8

Now, let's check each node to see if it forms a 3-star with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.

- Node 1: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 5, 6, and 9. So, we have one 3-star here: <1, (5, 6, 9)>.

- Node 2: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.

- Node 4: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 7, 8, and 2. So, we have one 3-star here: <4, (7, 8, 2)>.

- Node 5: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.

- Node 6: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.

- Node 7: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 3 neighbors.

- Node 8: Does not form a 3-star as it has only 2 neighbors.

- Node 9: Forms a 3-star with neighbors 1, 8, and 0. So, we have one 3-star here: <9, (1, 8, 0)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 2)>, and <9, (1, 8, 0)>.
