Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 1.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to node 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 14

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [14], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (4, 9, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>
