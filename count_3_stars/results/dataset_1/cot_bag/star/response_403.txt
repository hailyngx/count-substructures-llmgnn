Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.

Adding these up, we have a total of 28 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are as follows:
<1, (2, 4, 6)> 
<1, (2, 4, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (2, 1, 4)>
<2, (4, 6, 3)>
<1, (2, 6, 3)>
<1, (6, 9, 4)>
<1, (2, 6, 4)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 4)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2,  (1, 4, 6)>
<2,  (4, 1, 6)>
 
So, the total number of 3-stars is [28].
