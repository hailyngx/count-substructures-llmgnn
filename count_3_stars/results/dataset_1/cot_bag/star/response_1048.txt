Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the graph can be visualized as follows:

                     1---7
                    /   /|
                   0   2-8
                    \ /|/
                     4 3--5
                        |
                        9
                        |
                        6

Analyzing the graph, we identify the nodes with three or more neighbors as nodes 0, 2, and 3. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0:
    - Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, and 6.
    - There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star centered around node 0.
    - So, for node 0, we have [<0, (4, 5, 6)>]
    
2. Node 2: 
    - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 7, and 8.
    - There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star centered around node 2.
    - So, for node 2, we have [<2, (3, 7, 8)>]
    
3. Node 3:
    - Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, and 6.
    - There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star centered around node 3.
    - So, for node 3, we have [<3, (2, 5, 6)>]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, and <3, (2, 5, 6)>.
