Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
0: 2
1: 3, 5, 6, 7
2: 0, 6
3: 1, 6, 8, 9
4: 6
5: 1, 6, 7, 9
6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
7: 1, 5, 8
8: 3, 7, 9
9: 3, 5, 8

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars
Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star
Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [24].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (3, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<3, (1, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<3, (5, 1, 6)>
<3, (5, 1, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (3, 1, 6)>
<5, (3, 1, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 2, 5)>
<6, (2, 1, 4)>
<6, (2, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
<6, (5, 1, 7)>
<6, (5, 1, 9)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
