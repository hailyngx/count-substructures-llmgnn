Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph based on the given edges:

                        2 - 9 - 7
                        |       |
                        5 - 3 - 8
                           |
                        0 - 1 - 7
                        |       |
                        4 - 6 - 9

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

Node 0: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 1: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 3: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 4: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 6: 3-stars = inom{3}{3} = 1
Node 7: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 8: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4
Node 9: 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>
