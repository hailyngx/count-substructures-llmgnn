Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as:

```
          0 --- 1     7
          |     |      
          5 --- 8 --- 9
               |
          4    3    2
           \  |  /
             6--
```

There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 4, and 5.

For node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 because only two neighbors)
For node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (0 because only two neighbors)
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 3-star)
For node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) (10 3-stars)

So, there are a total of [1 + 10 = 11] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 8, 4)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
