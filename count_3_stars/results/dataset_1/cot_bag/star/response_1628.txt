Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors so we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 8
Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, 9
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, 8
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, 8
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 9
Node 6 has 2 neighbors
Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 4
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5

For the nodes with three or more neighbors, the number of 3-stars for each node is given by choosing 3 out of its neighbors. Let's calculate this:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get 27 3-stars. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
