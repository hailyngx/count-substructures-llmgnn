Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9.

Now, we apply the combinatorial calculation \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 5, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 3)>, <9, (6, 7, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 9)>, <9, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (3, 8, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 8)>, <9, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (7, 8, 6)>, <9, (8, 5, 6)>, <9, (8, 6, 5)>, <9, (8, 9, 7)>
