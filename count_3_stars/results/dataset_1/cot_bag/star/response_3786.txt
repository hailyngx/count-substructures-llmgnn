Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 8.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>

Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
<2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 7, 8)>

Node 8 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
<8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].
