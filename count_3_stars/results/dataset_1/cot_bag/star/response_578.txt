Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1 -- 0 -- 7
   / \  / | 
  8   9  6
   \|/  \| 
    3 -- 5
        /|
       2 4
```

From the given information, we can see that node 0 has 4 neighbors, node 1 has 3 neighbors, node 2 has 2 neighbors, node 3 has 2 neighbors, node 4 has 3 neighbors, node 5 has 5 neighbors, node 6 has 4 neighbors, node 7 has 4 neighbors, node 8 has 7 neighbors, and node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 35 + 1 = 60 \)

So, the final answer is [60].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 7, 8)>, 
<4, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<5, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 8)>, 
<7, (0, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 3)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<8, (0, 1, 7)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 6)>, 
<8, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<8, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<8, (4, 5, 7)>, 
<8, (5, 6, 7)>, 
<8, (0, 7, 5)>, 
<8, (1, 7, 5)>, 
<8, (3, 7, 5)>, 
<8, (4, 7, 5)>, 
<8, (6, 7, 5)>
