Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 8
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 30 \), which we list inside brackets as [30].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (4, 5, 8)>
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <8, (0, 5, 9)>
