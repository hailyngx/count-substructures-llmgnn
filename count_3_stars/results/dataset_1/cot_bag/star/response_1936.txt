Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5
- Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 9
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5
- Node 5: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 6: 7
- Node 7: 3, 6
- Node 8: 1, 5, 9
- Node 9: 3, 8

We can now calculate the 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0 forms no 3-stars.
Node 1 forms no 3-stars.
Node 2 forms no 3-stars.
Node 3 forms 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 7)>
Node 4 forms 1 3-star: <4, (1, 2, 5)>
Node 5 forms no 3-stars.
Node 6 forms no 3-stars.
Node 7 forms no 3-stars.
Node 8 forms no 3-stars.
Node 9 forms no 3-stars.

There are 2 unique 3-stars in total, which we place inside brackets as: [2].
