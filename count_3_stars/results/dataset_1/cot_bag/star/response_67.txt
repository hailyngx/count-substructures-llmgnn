Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = [24]

Unique 3-star formations:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>
