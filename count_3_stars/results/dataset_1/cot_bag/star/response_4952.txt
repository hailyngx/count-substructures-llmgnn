Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 9
- Node 2 has neighbors: 4, 6
- Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 5

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.

For node 2, we have no 3-stars because it only has 2 neighbors.

For node 7, we again have no 3-stars because it only has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is simply 4.

So, the final answer is: [4]

And the unique 3-stars found are: <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 7, 9)>
