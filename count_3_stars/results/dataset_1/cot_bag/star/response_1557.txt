Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's start by constructing the graph based on the given information.  

The graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges can be represented as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 3), (4, 9), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 4)

Now, let's identify the nodes that are part of the 3-star graph.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 0 and 3.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 8, 9, 2.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 3, 9.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 3, 7.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 3, 4.

Now we can calculate the number of 3-stars. 

Node 3 forms 3-stars with nodes 2, 4, 8 and nodes 2, 4, 9. So, it contributes 2 3-stars.
Node 8 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 7. So, it contributes 1 3-star.
Node 9 forms a 3-star with nodes 3, 4. So, it contributes 1 3-star.

Adding these up gives us a total of [4] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 7)>
<9, (3, 4)>
