Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will first construct the graph based on the provided edge information. Then we will identify the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and count the 3-stars formed around those nodes.

The nodes and their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 7
- Node 1: 2, 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 3: 6
- Node 4: 1, 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5: 2, 4, 6
- Node 6: 3, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 4, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7 have 3 or more neighbors, making them potential centers for 3-star graphs. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19], and the unique 3-stars are:  
<1, (2, 4, 7)>,  
<2, (0, 1, 5)>,  
<2, (1, 4, 5)>,  
<2, (4, 5, 7)>,  
<2, (4, 5, 6)>,  
<4, (1, 2, 5)>,  
<4, (1, 5, 7)>,  
<4, (2, 5, 6)>,  
<4, (5, 6, 9)>,  
<7, (0, 4, 8)>.
