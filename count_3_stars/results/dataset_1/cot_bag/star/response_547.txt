Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
To analyze the graph and find the total number of 3-stars, we'll examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star with exactly three leaves.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8). This forms 1 3-star: <0, (5, 7, 8)>.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 9). This forms 1 3-star: <8, (0, 6, 9)>.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Therefore, there are [2] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (5, 7, 8)> and <8, (0, 6, 9)>.
