Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9.

For node 0: 
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <0, (2, 4, 9)>

For node 2:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, and their symmetric variations.

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-star: <4, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-star: <8, (1, 4, 9)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (0, 4, 5)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 33

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [33].
