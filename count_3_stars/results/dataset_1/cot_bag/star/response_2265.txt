Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

- 0 is connected to 3, 4
- 1 is connected to 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- 2 is connected to 1, 3, 4, 9
- 3 is connected to 0, 1, 2
- 4 is connected to 0, 2
- 5 is connected to 1
- 6 is connected to 1
- 7 is connected to 1, 9
- 8 is connected to 1, 9
- 9 is connected to 2, 7, 8

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and find the 3-stars:

- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( [20 + 4 + 1] = 25 \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 2, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 2, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 2, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 2, 9)>, <1, (8, 2, 9)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>.

So, the final answer is: [25].
