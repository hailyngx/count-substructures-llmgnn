Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-star configurations in this graph.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 1: Only 1 3-star
- For node 3: Only 1 3-star
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: Only 1 3-star
- For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 19 \)

So, there are a total of [19] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- <0, (7, 8, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (3, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 5, 9)>
- <5, (3, 9, 8)>
- <8, (0, 6, 9)>
- <8, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (2, 8, 9)>
- <8, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (8, 9, 5)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
