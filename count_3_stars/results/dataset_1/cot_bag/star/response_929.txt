Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 4:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
<4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>

For node 5:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 7:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<7, (4, 6, 9)>

For node 9:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<9, (2, 3, 7)>

Adding all the 3-stars together gives a total of 26 unique 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [26].
