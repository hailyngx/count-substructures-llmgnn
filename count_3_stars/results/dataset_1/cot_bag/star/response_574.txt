Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors. 
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: <0, (1, 4, 5)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (4, 5, 1)>
2. Node 1: <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (2, 0, 5)>, <1, (2, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 8)>
3. Node 2: <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <2, (3, 7, 1)>
4. Node 4: <4, (0, 7, 8)>, <4, (7, 8, 0)>
5. Node 5: <5, (0, 1, 8)>, <5, (1, 0, 8)>
6. Node 8: <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>
7. Node 9: <9, (6, 8, 0)>

From the above calculations, we find a total of 17 unique 3-stars in the graph. Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
