Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 with neighbors 8, 9
- Node 1 with neighbors 6, 7
- Node 4 with neighbors 5, 6, 7
- Node 5 with neighbors 3, 4
- Node 6 with neighbors 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 7 with neighbors 1, 4, 9
- Node 9 with neighbors 0, 6, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{1}{3} = 0
- Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 7: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1].

The unique 3-star found is <4, (5, 6, 7)>
