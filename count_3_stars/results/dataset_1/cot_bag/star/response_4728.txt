Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars it forms.

For each node with 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: Node 2, Node 3, Node 8 -> 1 3-star
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: Node 2, Node 5, Node 6, Node 7, Node 9 -> 2 3-stars
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: Node 0, Node 4, Node 6, Node 9 -> 1 3-star
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: Node 1, Node 2, Node 4 -> 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: Node 1, Node 2, Node 3, Node 8 -> 1 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 6

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
