Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have more than three neighbors:
- Node 0: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 4
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 7: degree 4
- Node 8: degree 4
- Node 9: degree 4

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) and sum them up:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36]. 

Here are the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 1, 5)>
<0, (5, 3, 7)>
<0, (5, 3, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 4)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<9, (2, 3, 5)>
