Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's construct the graph:

The nodes and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: {4, 7}
- Node 1: {3, 4, 5}
- Node 2: {4}
- Node 3: {1, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 5: {1, 3, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 6: {4, 5, 7}
- Node 7: {0, 6}
- Node 8: {3, 4}
- Node 9: {3, 4, 5}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars.

For Node 0: No 3-star is formed.
For Node 1: No 3-star is formed.
For Node 2: No 3-star is formed.
For Node 3: 1 3-star is formed.
For Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars are formed.
For Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars are formed.
For Node 6: No 3-star is formed.
For Node 7: No 3-star is formed.
For Node 8: No 3-star is formed.
For Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star is formed.

The total number of 3-stars is [1 + 10 + 4 + 1] = 16.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (0, 2, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 2, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 3, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 5)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [16].
