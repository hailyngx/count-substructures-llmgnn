Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
With 10 nodes and 22 edges, the graph can be visualized as:

```
    1 -- 8
   /      \
  0        9
   \      /
    3 -- 8
      /
  4 -- 7
       \
        6
       /
  2 -- 5
```

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 1 3-star <0, (3, 9)>.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star <3, (0, 8)>.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1 3-star <4, (6, 7)>.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. These 3-stars are <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 9)>, and <6, (2, 5, 9)>.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star <8, (1, 3, 9)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star <9, (0, 6, 8)>.

Putting it all together, we have a total of [14] 3-stars in the given graph.
