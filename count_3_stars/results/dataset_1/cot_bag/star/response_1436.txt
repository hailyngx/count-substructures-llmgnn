Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0: 5, 7, 8
- 1: 2, 4, 5, 7
- 2: 1, 5, 7
- 3: 6, 7
- 4: 1
- 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9
- 6: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
- 8: 0, 6
- 9: 5, 6

Now we can calculate the 3-star configurations:

Node 0: [1] 3-star
Node 1: [3] 3-stars
Node 2: [1] 3-star
Node 5: [3] 3-stars
Node 6: [3] 3-stars
Node 7: [3] 3-stars

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 3] = [14].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 5>
<1, 4, 5>
<1, 5, 7>
<2, 1, 5>
<5, 0, 1>
<5, 2, 1>
<5, 6, 7>
<5, 7, 6>
<5, 7, 9>
<6, 3, 7>
<6, 5, 7>
<6, 7, 5>
<7, 0, 5>
<7, 1, 5>
