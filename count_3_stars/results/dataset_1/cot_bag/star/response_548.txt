Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 20 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 5)>, <1, (6, 5, 8)>, 
<1, (8, 5, 2)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, 
<4, (0, 1, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<8, (5, 8, 2)>.
