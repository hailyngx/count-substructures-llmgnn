Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list for better visualization:

0: [3, 4]
1: [5, 8, 9]
2: [4, 7]
3: [0, 6, 8]
4: [0, 2, 7]
5: [1, 6]
6: [3, 5]
7: [2, 4]
8: [1, 3]
9: [1]

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
Node 0, 1, 3, and 4 have three or more neighbors.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they can form:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (No 3-stars since it has exactly 2 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
    - <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
    - <3, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (1 unique 3-star)
    - <4, (0, 2, 7)>

Combining the total number of 3-stars from all nodes with three or more neighbors gives [3].
