Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

1: 2, 4, 7  
2: 1, 7  
3: 6, 7, 9  
4: 1, 6  
5: 7, 9  
6: 3, 4, 8  
7: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9  
8: 6, 7, 9  
9: 3, 5, 7, 8 

Now, let's determine the number of 3-stars formed by each node:

- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 5: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 4] = 31

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in this graph is [31].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<3, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (1, 2, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (3, 5, 8)>
