Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 2, and node 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (3, 4, 6)>
  - <0, (3, 6, 9)>
  - <0, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <0, (3, 4, 9)>

- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <2, (1, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <2, (1, 4, 9)>

- For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 8, 9)>
  - <6, (3, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (3, 8, 5)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <6, (4, 8, 5)>
  - <6, (3, 7, 5)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 10 = 18 \).
So, the final answer is [18].
