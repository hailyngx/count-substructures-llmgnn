Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 3
Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 8
Node 3: 1, 8, 9
Node 4: 0, 6, 9
Node 5: 0, 2
Node 6: 0, 2, 4
Node 7: 0
Node 8: 0, 2, 3
Node 9: 3, 4

Now, let's find the 3-stars present in the graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 0 3-stars.

Adding them up, we get a total of [1 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 0] = [9] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (2, 3, 9)>
<8, (3, 1, 9)>
