Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 2
- Node 6: 1, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 1, 2)
- Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 0, 2)
- Node 2: 1 3-star (2, 0, 1)
- Node 6: 1 3-star (6, 1, 7)
- Node 7: 2 3-stars (7, 0, 1) and (7, 1, 6)
- Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 6, 2)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 1, 2>, <1, 0, 2>, <2, 0, 1>, <6, 1, 7>, <7, 0, 1>, <7, 1, 6>, <8, 6, 2>
