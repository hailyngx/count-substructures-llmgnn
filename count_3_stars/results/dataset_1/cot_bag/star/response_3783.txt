Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0, 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of [23] 3-stars:

<0, (2, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 6, 7)>, <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 5)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>
