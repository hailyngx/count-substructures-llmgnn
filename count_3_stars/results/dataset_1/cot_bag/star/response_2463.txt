Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 4, 8
Node 3 has 1 neighbor: 7
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 7
Node 6 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 8
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6

We see that nodes 0, 1, 4, and 7 have 5 or more neighbors, so they have the potential to form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 7: inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars

Adding these together, we have a total of [10 + 10 + 10 + 20] = 50 3-stars in the given graph.

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 4)>
