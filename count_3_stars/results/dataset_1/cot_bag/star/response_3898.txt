Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Here are the 3-stars in this graph:
[5]

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (2, 7, 9)>

<1, (4, 7, 9)>

<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>

<3, (2, 6, 7)>
<3, (2, 7, 9)>
<3, (6, 7, 8)>. 

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10].
