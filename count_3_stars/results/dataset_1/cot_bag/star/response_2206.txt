Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 3-stars.

Adding these up, we find that there are a total of [15] 3-stars in the given graph.

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <0, (7, 4, 1)>
- <2, (3, 0, 7)>
- <2, (4, 1, 6)>
- <2, (6, 1, 4)>
- <2, (8, 7, 6)>
- <3, (0, 7, 4)>
- <3, (2, 4, 1)>
- <4, (1, 6, 2)>
- <4, (2, 6, 1)>
- <4, (5, 7, 0)>
- <6, (1, 4, 2)>
- <6, (2, 4, 1)>
- <7, (0, 3, 9)>
- <7, (4, 1, 6)>
