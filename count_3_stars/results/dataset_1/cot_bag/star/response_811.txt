Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 8
- Node 2: 8
- Node 3: 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( inom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: \( 4 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 16 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
