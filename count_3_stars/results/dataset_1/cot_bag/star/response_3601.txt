Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given. Let's visualize the graph first:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 5), (1, 8), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 7), (6, 4), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 0), (9, 4)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: There is only 1 3-star with node 5 as the center, consisting of nodes 1, 3, and 7
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \( [10 + 1 + 4] = 15 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 15.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 8)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
