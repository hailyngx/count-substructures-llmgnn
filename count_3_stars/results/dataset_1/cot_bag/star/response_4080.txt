Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following edge connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 5, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.

Now, we will find the 3-stars:
- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6: <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 5, and 8: <4, (1, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with nodes 1, 4, and 7: <5, (1, 4, 7)>

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
