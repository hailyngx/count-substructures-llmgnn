Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 5, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 5.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 0 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 2 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1] = 11.

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (2, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>.
