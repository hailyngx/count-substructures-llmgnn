Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can create the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges. Let's determine the number of 3-stars in the graph:

For each node, we will calculate how many 3-stars can be formed considering it as the center node.

For node 0: It has neighbors 2, 5, 8. So, we can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
For node 2: It has neighbors 0, 1, 3, 8. So, we can form [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
For node 3: It has neighbors 2, 7, 8. So, we can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
For node 4: It has neighbors 6, 8. There are not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
For node 5: It has neighbors 0, 7. There are not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
For node 6: It has neighbors 4, 9. There are not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
For node 7: It has neighbors 3, 5, 8. So, we can form [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star.
For node 8: It has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9. So, we can form [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
For node 9: It has neighbors 6, 8. There are not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>

<7, (3, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>

<8, (9, 6, 9)>
<8, (9, 8, 9)>
