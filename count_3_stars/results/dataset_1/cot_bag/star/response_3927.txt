Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms any 3-star:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:

Node 1: C(4, 3) = 4
Node 3: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 4: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 5: C(3, 3) = 1
Node 6: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 7: C(5, 3) = 10
Node 8: C(3, 3) = 1

Adding them up: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 1 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [37].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<3, (5, 6, 7)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 7, 9)>
