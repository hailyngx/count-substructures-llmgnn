Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Therefore, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using each of these nodes.

For node 0:
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 2, 6)>
<0, (1, 7, 6)>
<0, (2, 7, 6)>

For node 1:
There are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<1, (0, 2, 8)>
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 8)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 8, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 8, 9)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>

For node 2:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<2, (0, 1, 9)>

For node 3:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<3, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 5:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<5, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 7:
There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 8:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<8, (1, 5, 7)>

For node 9:
There are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
<9, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 4)>
<9, (1, 5, 8)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (2, 5, 4)>
<9, (2, 5, 8)>
<9, (2, 4, 8)>
<9, (5, 4, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10] = [32].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 7)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 8)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 4)>, <9, (1, 5, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 5, 4)>, <9, (2, 5, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (5, 4, 8)>.
