Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with at least 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8.  
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:  

For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 15  

So, the total number of 3-stars is [15].  
The unique 3-stars are:  
<0, (5, 6, 8)>  
<3, (2, 7, 8)>  
<5, (0, 1, 8)>  
<6, (0, 7, 9)>  
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
