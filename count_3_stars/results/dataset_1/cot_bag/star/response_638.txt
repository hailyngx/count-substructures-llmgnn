Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we'll look at each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate how many 3-stars are formed with that node as the center. 

Let's go through the nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (7, 9, 4)>.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center: <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (0, 9, 2)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center: <5, (0, 1, 6)>.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (3, 9, 8)>.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors. There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 7, 2)>.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star with node 9 as the center: <9, (3, 4, 7)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we get 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 13.
So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<3, (7, 9, 4)>, 
<4, (0, 2, 8)>, 
<4, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (2, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 9, 2)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<7, (3, 9, 8)>, 
<8, (1, 2, 4)>, 
<8, (1, 4, 7)>, 
<8, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<8, (1, 7, 2)>, 
<9, (3, 4, 7)>.
