Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 1: 5
- Node 2: 0, 4, 8
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 8, 9
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula mentioned earlier. 

For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 46 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [46].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
