Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's analyze each node to determine the number of 3-stars it participates in:

1. Node 0 has 4 neighbors.
2. Node 1 has 5 neighbors.
3. Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
4. Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
5. Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
6. Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
7. Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
8. Node 7 has 4 neighbors.
9. Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
10. Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 3 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 5 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.

Summing these up gives a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 33 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer within brackets is [33].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 5)>
- <1, (0, 3, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 1, 4)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (0, 1, 7)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (1, 5, 2)>
