Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 4), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For node 0: has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9)
For node 4: has 4 neighbors (0, 7, 8, 9)
For node 1: has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6)
For node 5: has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 9)
For node 3: has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7)
For node 6: has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 9)
For node 7: has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 8, 9)
For node 9: has 5 neighbors (0, 4, 5, 6, 7)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 23 \]

So, there are 23 3-stars in the graph: [23]

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 5, 6)>, <9, (0, 6, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>
