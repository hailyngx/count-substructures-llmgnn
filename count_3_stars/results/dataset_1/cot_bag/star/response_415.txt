Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the graph is described by the given edges. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph following the steps outlined earlier.

First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of \(10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 26\) 3-stars in the graph.

So the final result is [26]. The unique 3-stars found are:
- <2, (0, 4, 8)>
- <2, (1, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <2, (4, 7, 8)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (1, 4, 8)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
- <9, (3, 5, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 8)>
- <9, (5, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 7)>
- <9, (5, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 6, 9)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
