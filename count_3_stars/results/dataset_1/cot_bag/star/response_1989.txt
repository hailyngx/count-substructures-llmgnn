Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 8. So, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 8. So, it forms 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 0, 3. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 8, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 1 neighbor: 5. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 8. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 0, 5. Not enough neighbors to form a 3-star.

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: \( [1 + 1 + 1] = [3] \)

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>

Therefore, the final answer is: \[3\]
