Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 3
- Node 1: 7
- Node 2: 5, 6
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 6, 7
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 1, 4, 5
- Node 8: 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 2 3-stars: <2, (5, 6, 7)> and <2, (6, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 has 1 3-star: <3, (0, 8, 6)>
- Node 4 has 1 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 5)>
- Node 6 has 1 3-star: <6, (2, 4, 7)>

Adding these up, we have a total of [5] 3-stars.
