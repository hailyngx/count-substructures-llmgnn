Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 27 \) 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars identified in this graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<2, (0, 3, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
