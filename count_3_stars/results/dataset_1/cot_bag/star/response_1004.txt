Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with at least three neighbors are:
Node 0: 4 neighbors
Node 1: 4 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 3 neighbors
Node 5: 4 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
\( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
\( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 15

So, the final number of 3-stars is [15].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (2, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<5, (7, 1, 0)>
<5, (7, 0, 8)>
<5, (7, 0, 8)>
<1, (6, 9, 5)>
<9, (4, 8, 1)>
<9, (4, 8, 1)>
<9, (4, 1, 8)>
<9, (4, 1, 8)>

So, the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <5, (7, 1, 0)>, <5, (7, 0, 8)>, and <9, (4, 8, 1)>.
