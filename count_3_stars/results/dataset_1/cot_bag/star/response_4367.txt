Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

- Node 0 has 8 neighbors: (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Since it has more than three neighbors, it can form \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars.

- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: (0, 6). As it has less than three neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: (8). As it has less than three neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (0, 4, 9). It can form 1 3-star.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (0, 3, 6, 8). It can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: (0, 6). As it has less than three neighbors, it does not form any 3-stars.

- Node 6 has 6 neighbors: (0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8). It can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (0, 6, 8). It can form 1 3-star.

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (0, 2, 4, 7, 9). It can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (0, 3, 8). It can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(56 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 93 \). Therefore, the final answer is [93].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (5, 6, 7)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>
