Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: {2, 6, 7}
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: {3, 5, 7}
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 9}
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: {0, 4, 5}
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

We can see that nodes 0, 1, 2, and 6 have 3 or more neighbors, so we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>.
