Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 4, 6, 7
- Node 3: 1, 4, 8
- Node 4: 2, 3
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 1, 2, 9
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 9: inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars (as it has less than 3 neighbors)

Adding up the 3-stars from each node: 1+1+1+1 = 4 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>.
