Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9}

Let's now identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

- Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it's not a part of any 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 4, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 6, 4), so it can form 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 4] = 5.

The unique 3-stars are:
<6, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 4)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
