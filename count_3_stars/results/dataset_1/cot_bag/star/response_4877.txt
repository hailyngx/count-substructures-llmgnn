Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: $ \binom{2}{3} = 0 $
- Node 1: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 2: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- Node 4: $ \binom{2}{3} = 0 $
- Node 6: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 7: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $
- Node 9: $ \binom{5}{3} = 10 $

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 
$ 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 35 $

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 7, 9)>, <9, (1, 2, 9)>
