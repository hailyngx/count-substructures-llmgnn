Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (4, 8, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 6, 7)>, <2, (5, 6, 4)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 4)>, <2, (7, 9, 4)>, <2, (7, 9, 8)>, <2, (4, 7, 2)>, <2, (2, 7, 9)>, <2, (2, 7, 8)>, <2, (2, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (4, 8, 2)>
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 9, 7)>, <4, (3, 9, 5)>, <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 5, 2)>, <4, (6, 7, 2)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 9, 7)>, <4, (5, 9, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (2, 7, 8)>, <4, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (4, 7, 2)>
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 6, 7)>
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars <7, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 2)>, <7, (6, 9, 8)>, <7, (6, 9, 4)>, <7, (6, 8, 4)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 2)>, <7, (2, 8, 9)>, <7, (2, 8, 6)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 4)>, <7, (1, 2, 9)>
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 2)>
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars <9, (2, 4, 7)>, <9, (2, 4, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (2, 4, 3)>, <9, (4, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 5, 4)>, <9, (5, 4, 6)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (6, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us:
\[ [0 + 1 + 20 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 ] = [79] \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 79.
