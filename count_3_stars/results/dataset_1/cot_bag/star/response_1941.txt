Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9.  
The neighbors of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 4 
- Node 1: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 9
- Node 3: 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 3, 4, 7
- Node 6: 1, 3, 4, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 1, 2

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-stars.

Adding up these results, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 11.

Therefore, the final answer is: [11]
The unique 3-stars are: <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>.
