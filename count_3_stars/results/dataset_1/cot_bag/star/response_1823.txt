Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we can analyze the nodes to identify the 3-stars.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 9
Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 9
Node 4 has 1 neighbor: 2
Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 5, 8
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 2, 7
Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 1, 3

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star <2, (3, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star <5, (1, 2, 6)>
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star <6, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3].
