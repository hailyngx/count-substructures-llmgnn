Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes and their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 6, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2
- Node 5: 1, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3, 5, 8
- Node 7: 1, 3, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 5

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0:
- It has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star: <0, (6, 8, 9)>

For Node 1:
- It has 5 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars:
   - <1, (2, 3, 4)>
   - <1, (2, 3, 5)>
   - <1, (2, 3, 7)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (2, 4, 7)>
   - <1, (2, 5, 7)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 5)>
   - <1, (3, 4, 7)>
   - <1, (3, 5, 7)>
   - <1, (4, 5, 7)>

For Node 2:
- It has 3 neighbors, so we have 1 3-star: <2, (1, 4, 9)>

For Node 3:
- It has 4 neighbors, so we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars:
   - <3, (1, 6, 7)>
   - <3, (1, 7, 8)>
   - <3, (6, 7, 8)>
   - <3, (1, 6, 8)>

For Node 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9:
- These nodes do not have enough neighbors to form any 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 10 + 1 + 4] = 16.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 4)>, <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 7)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (6, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>.
