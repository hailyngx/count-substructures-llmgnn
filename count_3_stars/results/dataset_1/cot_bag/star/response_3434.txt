Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 2: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Adding up these results, we get a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer inside brackets is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 5, 7)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<5, (8, 9, 3)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (1, 9, 5)>
<8, (1, 9, 6)>
<8, (6, 9, 5)>
<8, (9, 5, 1)>
