Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors can be represented as follows:
- Node 0: {3}
- Node 1: {3, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {4, 5, 9}
- Node 3: {0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 9}
- Node 5: {2, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {7}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {3}
- Node 9: {1, 2, 4}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with at least 3 neighbors:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 29 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [29].

Unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <2, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 5)>
- <3, (1, 4, 7)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 5)>
- <7, (1, 3, 6)>
- <7, (1, 5, 6)>
- <9, (1, 2, 4)>
