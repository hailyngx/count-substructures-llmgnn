Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 4) (6, 0) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph using the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 1 is connected to node 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 3 is connected to node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to node 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to node 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1 and 8.

Now, let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 6). Therefore, it can form $\binom{3}{3} = 1$ 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 5). Therefore, it can form $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is $1 + 4 = 5$.

Therefore, we can write the result as $[5]$.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
