Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are some nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's calculate how many 3-stars can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so there are 10 3-stars formed with this node.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star formed with this node.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a final count of [12].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>&nbsp,.
