Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 4, 7, 8
Node 1: 0, 3, 7
Node 2: 3, 6, 9
Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5
Node 4: 0, 3, 5
Node 5: 3, 4, 8, 9
Node 6: 2, 8
Node 7: 0, 1, 9
Node 8: 0, 5, 6
Node 9: 2, 5, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars: 
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 4: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 5: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 6: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 8: 0 (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (2, 4, 5)>
<3, (4, 0, 5)>
<3, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 9)>
<5, (4, 3, 8)>
<5, (4, 3, 9)>
<5, (8, 0, 6)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
