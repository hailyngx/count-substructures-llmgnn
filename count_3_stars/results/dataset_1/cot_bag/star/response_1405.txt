Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (no 3-stars)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (no 3-stars)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (no 3-stars)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [16].

The unique 3-stars are: <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>
