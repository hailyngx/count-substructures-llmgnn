Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: There are 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, and 8). This gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1: There are 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 7, and 9). This gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3: There are 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 5, and 7). This gives us \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5: There are 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9). This gives us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7: There are 6 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8). This gives us \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9: There are 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 5, 6, and 8). This gives us \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 + 4 = 31

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [31], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 3>
- <5, 2, 6>
- <7, 1, 9>
- <7, 2, 3>
- <7, 4, 6>
- <7, 6, 8>
- <9, 1, 5>
- <9, 1, 6>
- <9, 5, 6>
- <9, 5, 8>
