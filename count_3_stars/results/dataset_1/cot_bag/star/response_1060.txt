Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Nodes with less than three neighbors cannot form 3-stars.

From the given edges, we can determine that the following nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: neighbors {1, 6}
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 6: neighbors {0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9}
- Node 7: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 8}

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- For Node 0: [0 choose 3] = 0. Node 0 doesn't have enough neighbors to form a 3-star.
- For Node 1: [6 choose 3] = 20. There are 20 unique 3-stars with Node 1 as the center.
- For Node 6: [6 choose 3] = 20. There are 20 unique 3-stars with Node 6 as the center.
- For Node 7: [4 choose 3] = 4. There are 4 unique 3-stars with Node 7 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0 + 20 + 20 + 4] = 44.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (6, 3, 7)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (1, 5, 9)>
- <6, (3, 5, 9)>
