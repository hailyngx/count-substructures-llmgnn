Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first list the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 4
- Node 4: 0, 3, 9
- Node 5: 6, 8
- Node 6: 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 5, 7
- Node 9: 4, 6, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 0, there is 1 3-star: <0, (1, 3, 4)>
For Node 3, there is 1 3-star: <3, (0, 4, 9)>
For Node 4, there is 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 9)>
For Node 6, there are 4 3-stars: <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (7, 2, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 5)>, <6, (7, 9, 4)>
For Node 7, there is 1 3-star: <7, (2, 6, 9)>

Putting these together, we have a total of [8] 3-stars in the given graph.
