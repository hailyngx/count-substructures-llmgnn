Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (3 and 9), so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 1:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 4, 5), so it can form 1 3-star. 

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (0, 4), so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (1, 4), so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (7, 8), so it cannot form a 3-star.

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (6, 8, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 7), so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars are <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <7, (6, 8, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>.
