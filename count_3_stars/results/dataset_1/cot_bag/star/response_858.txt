Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, and 5.

For node 0:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star. 
<0, (1, 5, 8)>

For node 1:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<1, (0, 5, 6)>

For node 5:
There are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
<5, (0, 1, 6)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 3.
