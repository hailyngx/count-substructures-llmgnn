Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze the nodes to see which ones can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 7).
- Node 1: has 2 neighbors (4, 7).
- Node 2: has 2 neighbors (0, 9).
- Node 3: has 3 neighbors (0, 7, 9).
- Node 4: has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 6, 6).
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors (4, 8).
- Node 6: has 1 neighbor (4).
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 3).
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors (5, 9).
- Node 9: has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 3, 8).

Now, let's count the 3-stars:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 16.

So, the answer is [16].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 3, 4)>
<3, (0, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 7)>
<4, (1, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 7)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (5, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (2, 3, 8)>
<9, (3, 8, 9)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
