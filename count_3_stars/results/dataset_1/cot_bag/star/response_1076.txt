Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 7 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 35 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 59 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [59].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<8, (0, 1, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
