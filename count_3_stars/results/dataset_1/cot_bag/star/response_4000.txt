Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars each
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\( 7 \times 4 + 1 = 29 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [29].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 6)>
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 2, 4)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>

<9, (4, 5, 6)>
