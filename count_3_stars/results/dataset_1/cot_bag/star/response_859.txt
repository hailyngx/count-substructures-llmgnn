Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 1, 2, 3, 7, and 9.

For node 1, we can form 1 3-star because it has 3 neighbors: (1, 2, 3).

For node 2, we can form 3 3-stars because it has 3 neighbors: (2, 1, 7), (2, 3, 7), and (2, 1, 3).

For node 3, we can form 3 3-stars because it has 4 neighbors: (3, 1, 2), (3, 1, 9), and (3, 2, 6).

For node 7, we can form 6 3-stars because it has 5 neighbors: (7, 1, 2), (7, 5, 8), (7, 0, 8), (7, 0, 1), (7, 1, 5), and (7, 2, 5).

For node 9, we can form 4 3-stars because it has 5 neighbors: (9, 3, 4), (9, 4, 8), and (9, 3, 6).

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 17 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 1, 7)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (2, 0, 8)>
<7, (2, 5, 8)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
