Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first construct the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 5, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 4.

Based on the connections, we have the following 3-stars:

- Node 0: <0, (1, 2, 4)> [1]
- Node 1: <1, (0, 3, 5)> [1]
- Node 2: <2, (0, 4, 5)> [1]
- Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)> [2]
- Node 5: <5, (1, 2, 6)> [1]
- Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 4)> [1]

Total number of 3-stars = [1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1] = [7]
