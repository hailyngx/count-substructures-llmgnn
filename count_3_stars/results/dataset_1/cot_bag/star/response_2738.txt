Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
(0, 4), (0, 9)
(1, 3), (1, 7)
(2, 4), (2, 9)
(3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 8)
(4, 0), (4, 2)
(5, 6), (5, 7)
(6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9)
(7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 9)
(8, 3), (8, 6), (8, 9)
(9, 0), (9, 2), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)

Now we will analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 2 neighbors
Node 2: 2 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors
Node 4: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 2 neighbors
Node 6: 3 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 3 neighbors
Node 9: 5 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 17

In brackets: [17]

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (1, 7, 5)>
<6, (5, 7, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<7, (1, 3, 8)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (0, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
<9, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (0, 7, 8)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
