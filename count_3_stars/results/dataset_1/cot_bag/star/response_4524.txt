Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, and 8
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 6
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 5, and 8
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, and 7
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 4

Now let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 24, so [24].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 2)>, <1, (3, 8, 2)>, 
<2, (1, 5, 6)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>,
<4, (0, 7, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (1, 3, 7)>
