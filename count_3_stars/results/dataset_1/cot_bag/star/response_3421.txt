Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
This 3-star graph can be visualized with the following nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 6), (7, 9), (8, 2), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 7)

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

For node 2: 3-stars = C(3,3) = 1
For node 4: 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4
For node 5: 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4
For node 6: 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4

Adding them up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
