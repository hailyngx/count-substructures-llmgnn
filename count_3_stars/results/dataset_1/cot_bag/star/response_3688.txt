Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    1---5       2       
   / \        / \      
  /   \      /   \     
 0     4----6     9    
  \   /        \   /    
   \ /          \ /     
    7            3     
     \                     
      8                   
```

Counting the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7 has \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 has \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 4)>
<0, (1, 9, 4)>
<0, (4, 8, 1)>
<0, (4, 9, 1)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 0)>
<4, (8, 1, 0)>
<4, (9, 0, 1)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)> 
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<7, (0, 5, 1)>
<7, (0, 9, 4)>
<7, (1, 0, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 6, 2)>
