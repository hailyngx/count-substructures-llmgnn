Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
    0 --- 2
   / \  /  \
  4--- 7    9
   \   |
     3 | 
      \|  
       5
       |\
       | 8
       |
       6
```

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star is formed.
Node 2 has 5 neighbors. There are inom{5}{3} = 10 possible 3-stars.
Node 4 has 5 neighbors. There are inom{5}{3} = 10 possible 3-stars.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors. There are inom{4}{3} = 4 possible 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors. No 3-star is formed.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor. No 3-star is formed.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors. There is 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 27.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (0, 4, 7)>
<2, (4, 3, 9)>
<2, (7, 0, 4)>
<2, (9, 3, 4)>
<2, (9, 6, 4)>
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<4, (2, 7 ,0)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 3, 8)>
<6, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
