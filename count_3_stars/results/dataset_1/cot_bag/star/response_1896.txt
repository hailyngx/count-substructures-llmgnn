Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (7, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
This is how the graph looks:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 2.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to node 0.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2 and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars:
Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph. The total number of 3-stars is [0].
