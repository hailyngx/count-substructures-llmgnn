Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4 + 4] = [9] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 2, 5)>
<3, (1, 2, 9)>
<3, (5, 0, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 3, 5)>
<9, (1, 3, 5)>
