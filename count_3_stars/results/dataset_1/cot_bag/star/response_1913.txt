Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes and their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 7, 8
- Node 2: 7
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6
- Node 6: 4, 5
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 4, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 4
- Node 9: 4, 7

 nodes 0, 4, and 7 have three or more neighbors, therefore we can form 3-stars with them: 

- For node 0, we have \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
  
- For node 4, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
  
- For node 7, we have \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( 1 + 10 + 10 = 21 \), so [21].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 5, 7)>, <4, (6, 5, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>.
