Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6
- Node 1: 3, 4, 7
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 6
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3
- Node 7: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 4, 7, 9
- Node 9: 4, 7, 8

Next, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 2: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 5: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 6: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<3, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (1, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (5, 8, 9)>
