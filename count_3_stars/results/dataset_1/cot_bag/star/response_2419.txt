Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are a total of 10 nodes. Let's list the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors and find the 3-stars associated with them:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 7.
   - Number of 3-stars formed: C(3, 3) = 1
   - 3-stars related to node 0: <0, (1, 2, 7)>
   
2. Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 8, 9.
   - Number of 3-stars formed: C(4, 3) = 4
   - 3-stars related to node 2: <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>
  
3. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9.
   - Number of 3-stars formed: C(4, 3) = 4
   - 3-stars related to node 5: <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>

4. Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9.
   - Number of 3-stars formed: C(5, 3) = 10
   - 3-stars related to node 8: <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is calculated as [1 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 19.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<<0, (1, 2, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (0, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 4, 6)>, <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>>
