Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 19

So, the final answer is [19].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<6, (8, 9, 0)>
<6, (8, 9, 2)>
<6, (8, 9, 5)>
