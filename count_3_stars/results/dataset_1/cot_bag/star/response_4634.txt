Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph and their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: {1, 5, 9}
- Node 1: {0, 2, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {1}
- Node 3: {5}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 7}
- Node 6: {1, 7}
- Node 7: {1, 5, 6}
- Node 8: {1, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 8}

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors which is less than 3, so no 3-stars are formed with this node.
- All other nodes have less than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with them.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 1 + 1] = 12 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 7)>
<1, (7, 5, 6)>
<1, (7, 6, 8)>
<1, (7, 6, 5)>
<1, (5, 0, 7)>
<1, (5, 7, 6)>
<1, (5, 7, 0)>
<1, (6, 7, 5)>
<5, (0, 7, 3)>
<7, (1, 6, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
