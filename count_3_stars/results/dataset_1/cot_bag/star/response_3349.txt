Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph representation:

```
    0 -- 2 -- 7 -- 9
    |           | /
    6 -- 1       3
    |           | \
    8           5
```

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars:

For node 2:
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- There's 1 3-star with node 2 as the center: <2, (0, 7, 9)>.

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, 7, and 9.
- There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 3 as the center: <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (5, 6, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>.

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 7, and 8.
- There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 8)>.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 7 as the center: <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>.

For node 9:
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 7, and 8.
- There are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center: <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>.

Putting it all together, there are a total of [1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 21 3-stars in the graph.
