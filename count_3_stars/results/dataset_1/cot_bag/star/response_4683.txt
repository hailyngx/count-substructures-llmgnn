Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. In this case, nodes 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 1: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
For node 3: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
For node 6: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
For node 7: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$ 3-stars
For node 8: ${3 \choose 3} = 1$ 3-star
For node 9: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: $1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 21$

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [21]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 2, 3>
<3, 1, 8>
<3, 6, 4>
<3, 7, 0>
<3, 7, 8>
<6, 3, 4>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 3, 1>
<7, 3, 8>
<7, 9, 0>
<8, 1, 3>
<9, 0, 7>
<9, 0, 5>
<9, 2, 1>
<9, 4, 6>
<9, 5, 6>
<9, 7, 0>
<9, 7, 3>
<9, 7, 8>
<9, 7, 5>
