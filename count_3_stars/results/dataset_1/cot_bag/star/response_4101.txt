Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

The graph:
```
   1 --- 4
   |     |
   0 --- 2 -- 8 -- 9
   |     |    |
   5 --- 3 -- 6
   |
   7
```

Now we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 11 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [11], and the unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (1, 5, 7)>
- <2, (4, 5, 7)>
- <2, (5, 3, 7)>
- <2, (7, 3, 8)>
- <5, (0, 2, 3)>
