Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph as an adjacency list:

Node 0: [7, 9]
Node 1: [5, 8]
Node 2: [3, 4, 8, 9]
Node 3: [2]
Node 4: [2]
Node 5: [1, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Node 6: [5, 7]
Node 7: [0, 5, 6]
Node 8: [1, 2, 5]
Node 9: [0, 2, 5]

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms 3-stars with (3, 4, 8) and (3, 4, 9).
- Node 5 forms 3-stars with (1, 6, 7), (1, 6, 8), (1, 6, 9), (1, 7, 8), (1, 7, 9), (1, 8, 9).
- Node 7 forms 3-stars with (0, 5, 6), (0, 5, 8), (0, 5, 9), (0, 6, 8), (0, 6, 9), (0, 7, 8), (0, 7, 9).
- Node 8 forms 3-stars with (1, 2, 5).
- Node 9 forms 3-stars with (0, 2, 5).

There are 2 3-stars formed from node 2, 6 3-stars formed from node 5, 7 3-stars formed from node 7, 1 3-star formed from node 8, and 1 3-star formed from node 9. 
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 1] = 17.

Here are the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<2, (3, 4, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 8)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 5, 6)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>, <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 7, 8)>, <7, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <9, (0, 2, 5)>.
