Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, the total number of 3-stars is [4 + 1 + 1] = 6.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 3, 8)>
<0, (6, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<9, (1, 2, 7)>
