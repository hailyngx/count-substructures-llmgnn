Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
With 10 nodes and 34 edges, the graph is as follows:
Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 1), (0, 4), (0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 1), (3, 6), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 3), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 9), (9, 8)

Calculating the degrees of each node:
deg(0) = 4, deg(1) = 6, deg(2) = 3, deg(3) = 2, deg(4) = 4, deg(5) = 1, deg(6) = 5, deg(7) = 2, deg(8) = 5, deg(9) = 1

1. For node 1:
    - It has 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7).
    - Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (4, 6, 8)>

2. For node 6:
    - It has 5 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).
    - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 4)>

[Total number of 3-stars: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) ]
