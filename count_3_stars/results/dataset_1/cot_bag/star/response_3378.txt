Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9, and the edges are given accordingly. 
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 7)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 7, 9)
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors (1, 7)
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8)
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors (5, 6)
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors (0, 4)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 9)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 2)
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors (3, 9)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 6, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 6.

Hence, the final count of 3-stars in the given graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (0, 1, 2)>, <9, (1, 6, 8)>.
