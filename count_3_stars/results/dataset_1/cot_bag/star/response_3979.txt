Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we first need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Here are the nodes and their corresponding neighbors:
- Node 0: {3, 5, 6}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 7}
- Node 3: {0, 4, 5, 6}
- Node 4: {2, 3, 5, 9}
- Node 5: {0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 7, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 2, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {5, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 5}

From the list above, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 have three or more neighbors. These are the nodes from which 3-stars can be formed.

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For node 0, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- For node 2, we have inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- For node 3, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- For node 4, we have inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- For node 5, we have inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.
- For node 6, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- For node 7, we have inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Adding these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 10 = 50.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [50].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <2, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- <6, (0, 2, 7)>
- <7, (2, 5, 6)>
- <5, (7, 8, 9)>
