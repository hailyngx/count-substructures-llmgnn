Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: {1, 7, 8}
- Node 1: {0, 3, 6, 7}
- Node 2: {4, 6, 8}
- Node 3: {1}
- Node 4: {2, 9}
- Node 5: {7, 8}
- Node 6: {1, 2, 7, 9}
- Node 7: {0, 1, 5, 6, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 5, 7}
- Node 9: {4, 6}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0: The 3-stars formed by Node 0 = 1 (since it has exactly 3 neighbors)
- For Node 1: The 3-stars formed by Node 1 = C(4,3) = 4 (as it has 4 neighbors)
- For Node 6: The 3-stars formed by Node 6 = C(4,3) = 4 (as it has 4 neighbors)
- For Node 7: The 3-stars formed by Node 7 = C(5,3) = 10 (as it has 5 neighbors)
- For Node 8: The 3-stars formed by Node 8 = C(4,3) = 4 (as it has 4 neighbors)

Summing up these results, we get: 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 23

Therefore, there are [23] 3-stars in the given graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 7, 8)>
- <1, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <7, (0, 5, 8)>
