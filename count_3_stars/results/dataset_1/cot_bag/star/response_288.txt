Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 7
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 6
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 6, 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 2) + 4 (from node 6) + 1 (from node 8) + 4 (from node 9) = 11

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 11, which can be represented as [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (3, 6, 8)>.
