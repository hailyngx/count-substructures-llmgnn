Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 1, 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 3, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 1, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 3, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 6, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 7, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 8, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

So, in total, there are \( 4 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 60 \) 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6, 7)>
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (5, 7, 9)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <6, (3, 8, 9)>
- <7, (8, 9, 0)> 

Therefore, there are [60] 3-stars in the provided graph.
