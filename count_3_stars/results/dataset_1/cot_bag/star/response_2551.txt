Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0: Has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 8)
- Total 3-stars involving node 0: [1]

Node 1: Has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6)
- Total 3-stars involving node 1: [1]

Node 2: Has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7)
- Total 3-stars involving node 2: [20]

Node 3: Has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 9)
- Total 3-stars involving node 3: [4]

Node 4: Has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 9)
- Total 3-stars involving node 4: [1]

Node 5: Has 3 neighbors (2, 8, 9)
- Total 3-stars involving node 5: [1]

Node 6: Has 5 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 7, 8)
- Total 3-stars involving node 6: [10]

Node 7: Has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 6)
- Total 3-stars involving node 7: [1]

Node 8: Has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 6, 9)
- Total 3-stars involving node 8: [4]

Node 9: Has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 8)
- Total 3-stars involving node 9: [4]

Summing up the total 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [47]

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, 1, 2>, <0, 2, 8>, <1, 0, 2>, <1, 2, 6>, <2, 0, 1>, <2, 0, 8>, <2, 1, 6>, <2, 3, 7>, <2, 4, 6>, <2, 5, 8>, <2, 7, 3>, <2, 7, 6>, <2, 7, 9>, <2, 4, 9>, <2, 5, 9>, <3, 2, 7>, <3, 6, 7>, <3, 7, 2>, <3, 7, 6>, <4, 2, 9>, <4, 6, 9>, <5, 2, 8>, <5, 8, 2>, <5, 2, 9>, <6, 1, 2>, <6, 3, 4>, <6, 3, 7>, <6, 3, 9>, <6, 4, 2>, <6, 4, 9>, <6, 7, 2>, <6, 7, 3>, <6, 7, 8>, <7, 2, 3>, <7, 3, 6>, <7, 6, 2>, <8, 0, 2>, <8, 2, 5>, <8, 5, 2>, <8, 2, 9>, <9, 2, 4>, <9, 2, 5>, <9, 3, 7>, <9, 4, 6>, <9, 5, 2>, <9, 5, 8>
