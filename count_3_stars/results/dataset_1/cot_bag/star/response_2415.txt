Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 32 edges, let's analyze the nodes to find the 3-stars:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.
Node 7 has 5 neighbors.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
Node 9 has 7 neighbors.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:

Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 forms \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars.

Summing up the 3-stars, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 = 57 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [57].

Unique 3-stars: <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>.
