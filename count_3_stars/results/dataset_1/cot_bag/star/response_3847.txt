Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. From the provided edges, we can see that nodes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 have three or more neighbors, while nodes 0 and 8 have less than 3 neighbors and therefore do not form any 3-stars. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 22

Putting this final number inside brackets, we have [] = [22].

List of unique 3-stars:
<1, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>
