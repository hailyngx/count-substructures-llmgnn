Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars that can be formed using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes. Let's proceed with the calculations:

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 8.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is not enough to form a 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4] = 6.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 6>
- <0, 1, 8>
- <3, 1, 8>
- <3, 2, 8>
- <3, 8, 7>
- <8, 0, 3>
