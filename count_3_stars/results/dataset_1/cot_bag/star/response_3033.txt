Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 0), (3, 7), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 1), (7, 3), (7, 8), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 5)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has 5 neighbors (4, 5, 6, 8, 9)
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 8, 9)
Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 7)
Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16

So, the final answer is [16].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
