Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Let's list the nodes with their neighbors first:

Node 0: 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 1: 0, 8
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 6
Node 3: 2, 4, 5, 8
Node 4: 2, 3, 7
Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8
Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 8
Node 7: 4, 6
Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9
Node 9: 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 41 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [41], and the unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 6)>
