Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 3) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors. Node 1 has 2 neighbors. Node 2 has 2 neighbors. Node 3 has 2 neighbors. Node 4 has 1 neighbor. Node 5 has 1 neighbor. Node 6 has 3 neighbors. Node 7 has 1 neighbor. Node 8 has 2 neighbors. Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

We see that only node 6 has 3 or more neighbors, making it a potential center for a 3-star.

For node 6, let's list the 3-stars:
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 3, 9)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
