Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 6
- Node 1: 5, 6
- Node 3: 4, 5
- Node 4: 0, 3, 6
- Node 5: 0, 1, 3, 6
- Node 6: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 6, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 6

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars. 

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 6 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.
Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 26. 

Therefore, the final answer is [26]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<5, (0, 1, 6)>, 
<5, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<5, (1, 3, 6)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 4)>, 
<6, (0, 1, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (1, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (3, 4, 5)>, 
<6, (4, 5, 6)>, 
<6, (6, 7, 9)>.
