Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 16 edges, we first need to identify the nodes with three or more neighbors. Here are the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 6, 7
- Node 2: 0, 8
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 0, 5, 6, 8
- Node 8: 2, 7, 9
- Node 9: 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 5: No 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: [1 + 0 + 4 + 1] = 6

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 6, 8)>
<7, (0, 8, 9)>
<7, (5, 6, 8)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
