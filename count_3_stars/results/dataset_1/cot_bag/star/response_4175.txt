Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 1) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with exactly 3 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, and 5. 

For node 2:
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
<2, (0, 3, 5)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 forms 4 3-stars.
<3, (2, 4, 5)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (4, 5, 7)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
<5, (1, 3, 7)>

Thus, there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.
