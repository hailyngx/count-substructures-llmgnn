Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can construct the graph with the specified nodes and edges. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to calculate the number of 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, 2, 1, 7

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes using the formula \(\binom{n}{3}\):

- For node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- For node 4: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- For node 5: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- For node 6: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- For node 2: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-stars
- For node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star
- For node 7: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 41

So, the final number of 3-stars is [41].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 4, 6)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 7)>
<1, (0, 4, 6)>
<7, (2, 4, 6)>
<4, (8, 9, 5)>
