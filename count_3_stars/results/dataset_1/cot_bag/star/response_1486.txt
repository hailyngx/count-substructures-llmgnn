Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 6
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 5, 6
- Node 9: 1, 6, 7

Applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 6: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star
- Node 8: 1 3-star
- Node 9: 1 3-star

So there are a total of [6] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 6, 7)>
- <1, (0, 7, 8)>
- <6, (0, 2, 3)>
- <7, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <9, (1, 6, 7)>
