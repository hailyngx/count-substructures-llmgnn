Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. We can see that nodes 0, 2, 5, 8, and 9 have 5 neighbors each, while nodes 3, 6 have 3 neighbors each. So let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0:  
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \ \text{3-stars} \]
<0, (2, 3, 8)>  
<0, (2, 5, 8)>  
<0, (2, 8, 3)>  
<0, (2, 8, 4)>  
<0, (2, 8, 5)>  
<0, (3, 8, 4)>  
<0, (3, 8, 5)>  
<0, (4, 6, 8)>  
<0, (5, 1, 6)>  
<0, (5, 6, 8)>  

2. Node 2:  
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \ \text{3-stars} \]
<2, (0, 8, 3)>  
<2, (0, 8, 4)>  
<2, (0, 8, 5)>  
<2, (0, 9, 8)>  
<2, (3, 0, 8)>  
<2, (3, 8, 4)>  
<2, (3, 8, 5)>  
<2, (4, 6, 8)>  
<2, (8, 3, 0)>  
<2, (9, 5, 6)>  

3. Node 3:  
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \ \text{3-star} \]
<3, (0, 8, 2)>  

4. Node 5:  
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \ \text{3-stars} \]
<5, (0, 1, 6)>  
<5, (0, 6, 8)>  
<5, (2, 6, 8)>  
<5, (6, 4, 8)>  
<5, (6, 8, 9)>  
<5, (8, 4, 6)>  
<5, (8, 6, 9)>  
<5, (9, 2, 6)>  
<5, (9, 6, 8)>  
<5, (9, 8, 6)>  

5. Node 6:  
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \ \text{3-star} \]
<6, (4, 5, 8)>  

8. Node 8:  
\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \ \text{3-stars} \]
<8, (0, 2, 3)>  
<8, (0, 2, 4)>  
<8, (0, 2, 5)>  
<8, (0, 3, 4)>  
<8, (0, 3, 5)>  
<8, (0, 4, 6)>  
<8, (0, 5, 6)>  
<8, (0, 5, 9)>  
<8, (2, 3, 9)>  
<8, (4, 6, 9)>  

9. Node 9:  
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \ \text{3-star} \]  
<9, (2, 5, 6)>  

Adding up all these, we have a total of 10 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 43 3-stars in this graph.  
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [43].
