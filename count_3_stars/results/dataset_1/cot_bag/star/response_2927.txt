Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes in this graph that have 3 or more neighbors, which we will examine to find the 3-stars:

Node 0:
- Neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>

Node 1:
- Neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>

Node 3:
- Neighbors: 0, 2, 8
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 2, 8)>

Node 4:
- Neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 7
- Total possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 = 19   
So, the final answer is [19].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>
