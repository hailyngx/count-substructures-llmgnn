Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 9
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 5
- Node 4: 9
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 8: 2, 6
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5

Now let's find the 3-stars:
- Node 2 and Node 9 can form one 3-star each: <2, (3, 8, 6)> and <9, (0, 1, 4)>
- There are no other nodes with 3 or more neighbors, so there are no additional 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
