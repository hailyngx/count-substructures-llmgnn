Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the provided graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to determine the 3-stars.

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 = 27

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [27].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, 1, 9>
<1, 0, 4>
<4, 1, 9>
<5, 0, 9>
<9, 1, 4>
<9, 5, 7>
