Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges, we'll first determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. 

Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors.

Therefore, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes 1, 2, 6, and 9:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 13 3-stars.
So, the final answer is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 9)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
