Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
From the given information, the graph can be illustrated as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 7), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 5), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 7)

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Central node 4: <4, (0, 3, 5)>
2. Central node 5: <5, (0, 4, 6)>
3. Central node 7: <7, (0, 4, 9)>
4. Central node 0: <0, (4, 5, 7)>
5. Central node 3: <3, (2, 4, 7)>

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [5]
