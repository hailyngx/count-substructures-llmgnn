Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 3) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 6
- Node 1: 2
- Node 2: 0, 1
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5
- Node 4: 3
- Node 5: 3, 6, 9
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9
- Node 7: 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 5, 6

Let's calculate the 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it doesn't contribute to any 3-star.

Therefore, we have a total of \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 4 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 2, 6>
<3, 4, 5>
<5, 6, 9>
<6, 0, 5>

So, the final answer is \( [4] \).
