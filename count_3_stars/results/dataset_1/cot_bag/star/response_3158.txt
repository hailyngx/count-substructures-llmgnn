Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we can represent the graph as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5, 8, and 9
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7, 8, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 7 and 8
- Node 4 is connected to node 6
- Node 5 is connected to node 0
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, 8

Based on the connections, we can see that nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors, so we need to calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- For node 0: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ 3-stars
- For node 2: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
- For node 6: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
- For node 7: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars
- For node 8: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$ 3-stars
- For node 9: ${5 \choose 3} = 10$ 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = $20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 + 10 = 80$

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [80].

Now, listing the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 8)>
<7, (2, 3, 8)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
