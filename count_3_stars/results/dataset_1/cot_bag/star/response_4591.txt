Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 7 and 9
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, and 7
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 3, 7, 8, and 8
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 9, and 7
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 0 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 20 = 38

Therefore, there are a total of [38] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 2, 7)>
- <6, (1, 3, 9)>
- <6, (2, 3, 7)>
- <6, (2, 9, 7)>
- <7, (0, 4, 5)>
- <7, (0, 4, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- <7, (3, 4, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 5)>
- <7, (4, 8, 8)>
