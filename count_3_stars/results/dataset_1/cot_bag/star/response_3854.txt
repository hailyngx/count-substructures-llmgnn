Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars:
1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 19

Therefore, there are a total of 19 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (8, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 7, 2)>.

Putting this final number inside brackets:
