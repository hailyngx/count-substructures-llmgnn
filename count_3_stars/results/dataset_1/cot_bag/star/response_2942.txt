Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes and their connections are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to node 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 1.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 5, 7.

Now, we will determine the 3-stars in this graph. 

For Node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 7. We can form 1 3-star: <0, (3, 5, 7)>.

For Node 1:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8. We can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars: 
<1, (3, 4, 5)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (4, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, 
<1, (4, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>.

For Node 3:
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 6. We can form 1 3-star: <3, (0, 1, 6)>.

For Node 5:
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 9. We can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars: 
<5, (0, 1, 4)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>.

For Node 7:
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 9. We can form 1 3-star: <7, (0, 1, 9)>.

Adding up all the possible 3-stars calculated:
1 (from Node 0) + 10 (from Node 1) + 1 (from Node 3) + 4 (from Node 5) + 1 (from Node 7) = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].
