Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, we can determine the number of 3-stars in this graph by examining each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 7 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  - <0, (1, 8, 9)> is formed

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 5, 6}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <2, (0, 3, 6)> is formed

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: {2, 4, 7, 9}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <5, (2, 4, 7)> is formed

- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {0, 2, 4, 8}
  - Number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  - <6, (0, 4, 8)> is formed

Therefore, there are a total of [35 + 4 + 4 + 4] = 47 3-stars in the given graph. 

The unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<2, (0, 3, 6)>, 
<5, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<6, (0, 4, 8)>
