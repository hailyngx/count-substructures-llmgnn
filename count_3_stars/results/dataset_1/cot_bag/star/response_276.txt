Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The given graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges can be visually represented as follows:

```
0 --- 3    8
|     |    |
|     |    |
8     2 --- 5 --- 9
|          |     |
|          |     |
|          6     |
\----------|-----/
           7
```

Based on the construction of the graph, we can see that the nodes have the following number of neighbors:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 1 neighbor
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 3 neighbors
- Node 6: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now let's count the number of 3-stars:
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [3]. The unique 3-stars are <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (8, 6, 9)>, and <9, (1, 6, 5)>.
