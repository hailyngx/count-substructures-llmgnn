Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Let's now determine the 3-stars in this graph:

1. Node 1 has three neighbors (4, 5, 6), so it forms 1 3-star. 
2. Node 3 also has three neighbors (4, 5, 6), forming 1 more 3-star.
3. Node 4 has four neighbors (1, 3, 8), so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 5 has four neighbors (1, 3, 7), forming 4 more 3-stars.
5. Node 6 has two neighbors, so no 3-star is formed with it.
6. Node 7 has one neighbor, so no 3-star is formed with it.
7. Node 8 has three neighbors (4, 9), forming 1 more 3-star.
8. Node 9 has one neighbor, so no 3-star is formed with it.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 11\), and the unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <3, (4, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 8, 3)>, <4, (1, 5, 3)>, <4, (1, 3, 8)>, <4, (5, 3, 8)>, <5, (1, 4, 3)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (4, 3, 7)>, <8, (4, 9, 1)>, <8, (4, 9, 3)>.

So, the answer is [11].
