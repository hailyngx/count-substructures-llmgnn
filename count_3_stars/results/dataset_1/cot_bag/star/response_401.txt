Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then we calculate the number of 3-stars each such node forms.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 3 neighbors: 3, 8, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4: It has 2 neighbors that are also connected (4 and 7). Hence, it can form 1 3-star with these two nodes.
- Node 7: It has 2 neighbors that are also connected (7 and 9). Hence, it can form 1 3-star with these two nodes.
- Node 8: It has 2 neighbors: 0, 2. So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors that are also connected (9 and 7). Hence, it can form 1 3-star with these two nodes.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, 3, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 7, 9>
<2, 8, 0, 9>
<3, 0, 8, 9>
<4, 1, 7, 9>

Therefore, the final answer is: [5].
