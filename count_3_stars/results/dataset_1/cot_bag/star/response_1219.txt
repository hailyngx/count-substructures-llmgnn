Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The node degrees for this graph are as follows:  
Node 0 has degree 2   
Node 1 has degree 4   
Node 2 has degree 3   
Node 3 has degree 3  
Node 4 has degree 5   
Node 5 has degree 4   
Node 6 has degree 3  
Node 7 has degree 1   
Node 8 has degree 5   
Node 9 has degree 3  

Let's first list the nodes that have three or more neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they participate in:
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 29

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in this graph:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 2)>
<1, (4, 2, 5)>
<1, (5, 4, 2)>
<2, (4, 5, 2)>
<(4, 2, 5), 5>
<(4, 5, 2), 5>
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 3, 5)>
<4, (2, 5, 1)>
<4, (2, 5, 3)>
<4, (3, 1, 5)>
<5, (1, 4, 2)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 1)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (7, 2, 9)>
<8, (9, 0, 2)>
