Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors: 2, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)
- Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 8 (2 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 7 (4 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 3, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 8 (4 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors: 2, 5, 7, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 9 has neighbors: 6, 8 (2 neighbors)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 18

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 5, 6)>
- <3, (4, 5, 6)>
- <3, (5, 6, 7)>
- <3, (6, 7, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 8)>
- <6, (1, 3, 7)>
- <6, (3, 7, 8)>
- <6, (1, 7, 9)>
- <7, (0, 3, 6)>
- <7, (3, 6, 8)>
- <7, (6, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
