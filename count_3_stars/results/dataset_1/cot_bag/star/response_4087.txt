Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

```
    1----9
    |     \
    |      2
    |     /|\
    9    8 7 3
            |  
            5
```

Let's identify the number of neighbors for each node:
- Node 1: 2 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 2 neighbors
- Node 5: 2 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (3, 5, 7)>
- <2, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 3, 5)>
- <7, (2, 8, 9)>
- <9, (1, 2, 9)>
