Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph:

Nodes: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 8 and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 6
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 6 and 9
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 3
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

For node 2: 
Number of 3-stars = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 3: 
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
Unique 3-star: <3, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 4: 
Number of 3-stars = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 5: 
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
Unique 3-star: <5, (3, 4, 9)>

For node 6: 
Number of 3-stars = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 7: 
Number of 3-stars = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 8: 
Number of 3-stars = 0 (less than 3 neighbors)

For node 9: 
Number of 3-stars = \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1
Unique 3-star: <9, (2, 5, 7)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1] = [3]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is 3.
