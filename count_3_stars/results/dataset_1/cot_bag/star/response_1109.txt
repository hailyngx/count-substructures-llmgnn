Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
       0
      / \
     5   9
        /|\
       7 3 8
        | | |
        2 4 6
       
```


Now, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: Degree 2
- Node 1: Not present
- Node 2: Degree 2
- Node 3: Degree 3
- Node 4: Degree 1
- Node 5: Degree 1
- Node 6: Degree 1
- Node 7: Degree 3
- Node 8: Degree 4
- Node 9: Degree 4

We find that nodes 3, 7, 8, and 9 have three or more neighbors and could potentially form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = [10] \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <7, (3, 8, 9)>
- <8, (3, 9, 7)>
- <9, (3, 7, 8)>
