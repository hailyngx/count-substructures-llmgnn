Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Given the graph information provided, let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 8), forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1: has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9), forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2: has 2 neighbors, does not form a 3-star.
- Node 3: has 5 neighbors (2, 4, 6, 7, 9), forms 3 3-stars.
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6), forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5: has 4 neighbors (0, 4, 6, 7), forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 4, 5), forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7: has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5), forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8: has 2 neighbors, does not form a 3-star.
- Node 9: has 2 neighbors, does not form a 3-star.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars formed in this graph is 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8.   
So, the final answer is [8].  
The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (5, 7, 8)>  
<1, (4, 6, 9)>  
<3, (2, 4, 6)>  
<3, (4, 6, 7)>  
<3, (4, 6, 9)>  
<4, (1, 5, 7)>  
<5, (0, 4, 6)>  
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
