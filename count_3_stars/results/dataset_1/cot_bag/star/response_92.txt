Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    0-----3
    |    /|\
    |   / | \
    |  /  |  \
    | /   |   \
    |/    |    \
    8-----2-----4
         |     |\
         |     | \
         |     |  \
         7-----1   5
               |
               6
               |
               9
```

Now we can list the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Nodes with three or more neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8

Total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} \]
\[ = 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 \]
\[ = 44 \]

Therefore, there are 44 3-stars in this graph.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 8, 2)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 6, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 2)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (4, 7, 1)>, <3, (0, 1, 2)>, <3, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 4)>
