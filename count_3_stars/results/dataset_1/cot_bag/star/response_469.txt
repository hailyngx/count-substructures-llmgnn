Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors (3, 8, 9)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (3, 5, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 3: 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 4: 4 neighbors (2, 3, 8, 9)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (1, 6, 9)
- Node 6: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 5)
- Node 7: 4 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 8)
- Node 8: 4 neighbors (0, 4, 7, 9)
- Node 9: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8)

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
- For Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 

Adding these up: \( 10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 52 \).

Hence, the total number of 3-stars is [52].

Unique 3-stars found are:
