Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, we'll first construct the graph. Let's identify the nodes which have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors
Node 1: 2 neighbors
Node 2: 3 neighbors
Node 3: 2 neighbors
Node 5: 2 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 5 neighbors
Node 9: 3 neighbors

Now we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Summing these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 21

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

Unique 3-stars found in the graph:
<0, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 0, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (2, 0, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 6)>
<8, (3, 2, 9)>
<8, (6, 3, 7)>
<8, (7, 2, 9)>
