Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Now, we sum up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [26].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>
