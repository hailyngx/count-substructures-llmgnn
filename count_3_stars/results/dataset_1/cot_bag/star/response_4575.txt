Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node to see which nodes are connected to it:

- Node 0: Connected to node 9
- Node 1: No connections
- Node 2: No connections
- Node 3: Connected to nodes 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: Connected to node 5
- Node 5: Connected to nodes 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: Connected to nodes 3, 9
- Node 7: Connected to nodes 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: Connected to nodes 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: Connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <3, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <5, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <7, (5, 8, 9)>

- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <8, (3, 7, 9)>

- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form 10 3-stars.
  - <9, (0, 5, 6)>
  - <9, (0, 5, 7)>
  - <9, (0, 5, 8)>
  - <9, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (5, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (5, 6, 8)>
  - <9, (5, 7, 8)>
  - <9, (6, 7, 8)>
  - <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 = 14

Placing this final number in brackets: [14]
