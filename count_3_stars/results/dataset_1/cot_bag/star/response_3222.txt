Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze the nodes based on their degrees:
- Node 0 has degree 2
- Node 2 has degree 2
- Node 3 has degree 2
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 1
- Node 7 has degree 2
- Node 8 has degree 6
- Node 9 has degree 3

The total number of 3-stars in this graph will be the sum of the number of 3-stars each node with degree 3 or more can form:

For node 8 with degree 6:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For node 9 with degree 3:
\[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]

Summing these up gives a total of 21 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<8, (0, 2, 4)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
