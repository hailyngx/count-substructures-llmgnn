Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 8, 9
- Node 1: 8, 9
- Node 2: 0, 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5, 8
- Node 4: 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 3, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 6
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 8

Now we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 6 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now we calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For Node 0, there is 1 3-star
- For Node 2, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3, there is 1 3-star
- For Node 4, there is 1 3-star
- For Node 8, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 20 + 10 = 37

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [37].

Unique 3-stars:
