Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with that node as the center.

Let's start with each node:

- Node 0: Has 2 neighbors (3, 4), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 1: Has 2 neighbors (3, 4), so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2: Has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 5, 6), therefore it can form 1 3-star. <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 3: Has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 9, 9), therefore it can form 1 3-star. <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 4: Has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 6, 9), therefore it can form 1 3-star. <4, (0, 1, 2)>
- Node 5: Has 4 neighbors (2, 6, 7, 8), therefore it can form 1 3-star. <5, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 6: Has 6 neighbors (2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9), therefore it can form 4 3-stars. <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 7: Has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 8, 9), therefore it can form 1 3-star. <7, (5, 6, 8)>
- Node 8: Has 4 neighbors (5, 6, 7, 9), therefore it can form 1 3-star. <8, (5, 6, 7)>
- Node 9: Has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 7), therefore it can form 1 3-star. <9, (3, 4, 6)>

Adding up the number of 3-stars found, we have a total of 10 unique 3-stars. So the final answer is [10].
