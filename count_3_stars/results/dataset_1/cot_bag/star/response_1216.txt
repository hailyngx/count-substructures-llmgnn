Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we first need to determine which nodes have three or more neighbors. Then, for each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars formed with that node as the center.

From the provided edge list, the nodes with three or more neighbors are as follows:
- Node 1: neighbors {0, 4, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 2: neighbors {0, 3, 7}
- Node 3: neighbors {2, 5, 7, 9}
- Node 4: neighbors {1, 6, 9}
- Node 5: neighbors {1, 3, 6, 9}
- Node 6: neighbors {1, 4, 5}
- Node 7: neighbors {2, 3, 8}
- Node 9: neighbors {1, 3, 4, 5}

Now, we calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
   <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>

2. Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
   <2, (0, 3, 7)>

3. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
   <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>

4. Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
   <4, (1, 6, 9)>

5. Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
   <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>

6. Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
   <6, (1, 4, 5)>

7. Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 
   <7, (2, 3, 8)>

8. Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 26. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 9)>, <3, (5, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 5)>, <5, (3, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>.
