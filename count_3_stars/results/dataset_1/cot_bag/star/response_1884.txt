Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are given below:

- Node 0: 1, 3, 6, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 8
- Node 4: 1, 6, 8
- Node 5: 1
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 4
- Node 9: 2

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star.

Therefore, there are \( 1 + 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26 \) 3-stars in total.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we have [26].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 4, 8)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
