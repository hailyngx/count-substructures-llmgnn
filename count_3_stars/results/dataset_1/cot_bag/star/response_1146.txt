Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the provided edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 8), (3, 5), (3, 7), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 3), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 4), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 5)

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 3 has neighbors: 5, 7
Node 4 has neighbors: 6, 7
Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 7, 8
Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5
Node 8 has neighbors: 0, 5

Calculating the number of 3-stars around each eligible node:
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 2.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<5, (3, 7, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)> 

So, the final answer is [2].
