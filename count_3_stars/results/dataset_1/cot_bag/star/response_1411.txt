Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes and edges of the graph are as follows:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 0), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 1), (6, 4), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 8), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 8)

Let's find the 3-stars in this graph: 

Each node in the graph and its neighbors: 
- Node 0: {4, 9}
- Node 1: {6, 7, 9}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {2, 8, 9}
- Node 4: {0, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 5: {8, 9}
- Node 6: {1, 4, 8, 9}
- Node 7: {1, 4, 8}
- Node 8: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8}

Calculating the number of 3-stars: 

Node 1: 1 3-star
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 50

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [50].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<1, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (0, 6, 8)>
