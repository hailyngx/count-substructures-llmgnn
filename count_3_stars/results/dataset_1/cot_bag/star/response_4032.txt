Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's check each node to see if it can form a 3-star:

For node 0:
- Connected to: 1, 2, 4, 6, 9
- Can form 3-stars with: 1, 4, 6
- Number of 3-stars: 3

For node 1:
- Connected to: 0
- Can form 3-stars with: None

For node 2:
- Connected to: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
- Can form 3-stars with: 3, 4, 5
- Number of 3-stars: 3

For node 3:
- Connected to: 2, 6, 9
- Can form 3-stars with: 2, 6, 9
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 4:
- Connected to: 0, 2, 5, 8
- Can form 3-stars with: 0, 2, 5
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 5:
- Connected to: 2, 4, 8
- Can form 3-stars with: 2, 4, 8
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 6:
- Connected to: 0, 2, 3, 7, 8
- Can form 3-stars with: 0, 3, 7
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 7:
- Connected to: 6, 8
- Can form 3-stars with: None

For node 8:
- Connected to: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Can form 3-stars with: 2, 4, 5
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 9:
- Connected to: 0, 3
- Can form 3-stars with: None

Total number of 3-stars: [3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 9

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 4, 6>, <2, 3, 4, 5>, <2, 4, 5, 8>
