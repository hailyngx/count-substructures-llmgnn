Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 4, 5, 7, 8  
Node 1: 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  
Node 2: 1, 5, 9  
Node 3: 6, 7  
Node 4: 0, 6, 9  
Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 9  
Node 6: 1, 3, 4  
Node 7: 0, 1, 3, 8  
Node 8: 0, 1, 7  
Node 9: 1, 2, 4, 5  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up these, we get a total of 36 unique 3-stars, so the final answer is 36.

Therefore, the 3-stars are: 
<0, (4, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (1, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 8, 9)>, <9, (4, 5, 1)>
