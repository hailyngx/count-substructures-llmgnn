Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that each node is connected to:

Node 0: 6, 7, 8
Node 1: 2, 8
Node 2: 1, 8, 9
Node 3: 6, 8
Node 4: 7, 8, 9
Node 5: 7, 8
Node 6: 0, 3, 7
Node 7: 0, 4, 5, 6
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
Node 9: 2, 4

We see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 7, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:

For node 0, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 2, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 4, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 7, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Summing these up, we have a total of \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20] = 27 \) 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 6, 7, 8>, <2, 1, 8, 9>, <4, 7, 8, 9>, <7, 4, 8, 9>, <8, 0, 1, 3>, <8, 0, 2, 3>, <8, 0, 4, 7>, <8, 0, 5, 7>, <8, 1, 2, 3>, <8, 1, 2, 4>, <8, 1, 2, 5>, <8, 2, 0, 4>, <8, 2, 0, 5>, <8, 2, 3, 6>, <8, 2, 3, 7>, <8, 2, 4, 9>, <8, 3, 6, 7>, <8, 4, 0, 5>, <8, 4, 2, 9>, <8, 5, 7, 4>, <8, 5, 7, 6>, <9, 2, 4, 7>, <9, 4, 7, 5>, <9, 4, 7, 6>, <9, 4, 8, 0>, <9, 4, 8, 2>, <9, 4, 8, 3>, <9, 4, 8, 5>.
