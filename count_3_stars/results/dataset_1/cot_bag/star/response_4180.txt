Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
By analyzing the given edges, we can construct the following graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 8), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3), (6, 9), (7, 2), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 3), (9, 6)

To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to find the nodes that have 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 5 neighbors.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:

Number of 3-stars at node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Number of 3-stars at node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars are:
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 4, 8)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 3, 8)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (4, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 2, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 3, 9)>
