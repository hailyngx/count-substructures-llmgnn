Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

For Node 0:  C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
For Node 2:  C(5, 3) = 10 3-stars
For Node 3:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
For Node 4:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
For Node 5:  C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
For Node 6:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars
For Node 8:  C(3, 3) = 1 3-star
For Node 9:  C(4, 3) = 4 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 29

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [29].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<2, (3, 4, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<2, (4, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 5)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (6, 7, 8)>
<6, (2, 4, 9)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<6, (4, 9, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 6)>
<9, (2, 6, 8)>
<9, (6, 8, 8)>
<9, (0, 3, 8)>
