Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 3-stars.

Adding these up, we get a total of \(2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 18\) 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [18].

Here are the unique 3-stars:
<0, (6, 8, 2)>
<1, (3, 9, 1)>
<2, (5, 2, 6)>
<2, (5, 7, 3)>
<2, (6, 0, 8)>
<3, (1, 9, 1)>
<3, (7, 5, 2)>
<3, (8, 0, 6)>
<5, (7, 3, 1)>
<6, (0, 8, 2)>
<6, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (3, 1, 9)>
<7, (5, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 6, 2)>
<8, (0, 6, 2)>
<8, (2, 5, 7)>
