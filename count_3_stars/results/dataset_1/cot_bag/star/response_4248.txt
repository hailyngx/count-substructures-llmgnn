Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to form 3-stars:

1. Node 0 has 2 neighbors (1 and 5).
2. Node 1 has 6 neighbors (0, 2, 5, 7, 8).
3. Node 3 has 2 neighbors (5 and 9).
4. Node 4 has 2 neighbors (7 and 9).
5. Node 5 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8).
6. Node 7 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5).
7. Node 8 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 9).
8. Node 9 has 3 neighbors (3, 4, 8).

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- For node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 20 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 42

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (0, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 6, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 8)>
