Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: neighbors {4, 5, 8}
Node 1: neighbors {4, 5}
Node 4: neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7, 8}
Node 5: neighbors {0, 1}
Node 6: neighbors {4, 7, 9}
Node 7: neighbors {2, 4, 6, 8}
Node 8: neighbors {0, 4, 7}
Node 2: neighbors {7}
Node 9: neighbors {6}

Now, we will calculate the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up: 1 + 0 + 10 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>.
