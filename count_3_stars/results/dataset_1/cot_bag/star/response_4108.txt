Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

The neighbors of each node are:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 9
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 5, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 2, 5, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3, 6, 8

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding all the 3-stars from the nodes together: 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 33.

So, there are a total of 33 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [33]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
