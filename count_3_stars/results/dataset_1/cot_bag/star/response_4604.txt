Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 1, 6
- Node 4: 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 1, 4, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 5, 6, 9
- Node 8: 1, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 1, 4, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
    <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>
- Node 1: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
    <1, (0, 3, 5)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 8, 9)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 5, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 9)>, <1, (5, 8, 9)>, <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
    <4, (5, 6, 8)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- Node 6: [inom{6}{3}] = 20
    <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <6, (8, 9, 7)>
- Node 7: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
    <7, (0, 5, 9)>, <7, (0, 6, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
    <8, (1, 4, 9)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (1, 7, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>
- Node 9: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
    <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 20 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [64]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 64.
