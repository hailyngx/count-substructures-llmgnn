Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's first determine the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 5 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors

Now we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 20

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [20].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 3)>
<1, (2, 9, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (1, 5, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 7)>
<3, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
