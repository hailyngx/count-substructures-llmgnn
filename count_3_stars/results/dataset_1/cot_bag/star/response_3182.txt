Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 4), (1, 8), (2, 0), (2, 7), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 5), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 3), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 2), (7, 6), (8, 1), (9, 2), (9, 4), (9, 5)

Now let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 4, 8
--> 1 3-star can be formed with node 1: <1, (0, 4, 8)>

Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 7, 9
--> 1 3-star can be formed with node 2: <2, (0, 7, 9)>

Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6
--> 1 3-star can be formed with node 3: <3, (4, 5, 6)>

Node 4 has neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 9
--> 1 3-star can be formed with node 4: <4, (1, 3, 5)> and <4, (1, 5, 9)> 

Node 5 has neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 9
--> 2 3-stars can be formed with node 5: <5, (3, 4, 6)> and <5, (3, 4, 9)>

Node 6 has neighbors: 3, 5, 7
--> 1 3-star can be formed with node 6: <6, (3, 5, 7)>

Node 7 has neighbors: 2, 6
--> No 3-star can be formed with node 7

Node 8 has neighbors: 1
--> No 3-star can be formed with node 8

Node 9 has neighbors: 2, 4, 5
--> 1 3-star can be formed with node 9: <9, (2, 4, 5)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1+1+1+2+2+1+0+0] = [8].
