Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
There are 8 nodes that have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
2. Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
3. Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4
4. Node 7: inom{2}{2} = 1
5. Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1
6. Node 9: inom{2}{2} = 1

Adding up the number of 3-stars, we get [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [9].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 0, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 3)>
<6, (3, 4, 0)>
<6, (4, 0, 2)>
<6, (2, 0, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 0)>
<8, (3, 4, 5)>
<9, (0, 6, 2)>

So, the final answer is [9].
