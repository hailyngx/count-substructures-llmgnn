Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 0) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to node 8.
- Node 4 is connected to node 0.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.

Next, we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these nodes can form 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed with the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [4 + 1] = 5 \).

The unique 3-stars formed in this graph are:

<8, (3, 5, 6)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
