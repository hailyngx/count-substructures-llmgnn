Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 2) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's start by visualizing the graph with the provided information. 

The graph consists of 10 nodes and 24 edges:

- Node 0 is connected to node 4.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 8, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 0.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to node 2.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 5, and 8.

Now, let's identify the 3-star structures in this graph:

1. Node 1: <1, (3, 5, 6)>
2. Node 2: No 3-stars formed (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
3. Node 3: <3, (1, 8, 9)>
4. Node 5: No 3-stars formed (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)
5. Node 6: <6, (1, 2, 5)>
6. Node 8: <8, (2, 3, 9)>
7. Node 9: No 3-stars formed (as it has exactly 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
