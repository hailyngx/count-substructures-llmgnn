Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 1, 2, and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: (2, 4, 8). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0 as the center, leading to the 3-star <0, (2, 4, 8)>.

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: (3, 4, 6). So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 1 as the center, leading to the 3-star <1, (3, 4, 6)>.

- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: (0, 3, 4, 7). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 2 as the center, leading to the 3-stars <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, and <2, (0, 3, 7)>.

- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (0, 1, 2, 7). So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center, leading to the 3-stars <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, and <4, (1, 2, 7)>.

Putting these all together, we have a total of [1 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 10 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars found are <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 2)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (0, 2, 7)>, and <4, (1, 2, 7)>.
