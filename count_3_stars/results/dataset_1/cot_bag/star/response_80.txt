Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Node 0 has neighbors: 1, 2
Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2
Node 2 has neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6
Node 3 has neighbors: 7, 8
Node 4 has neighbors: 7, 8, 9
Node 5 has neighbors: 2, 7
Node 6 has neighbors: 2, 7, 8
Node 7 has neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
Node 8 has neighbors: 3, 4, 6
Node 9 has neighbors: 4, 7

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

- Node 2 forms one 3-star with nodes 5, 7, and 6: <2, (5, 7, 6)>
- Node 3 forms one 3-star with nodes 7, 4, and 9: <3, (7, 4, 9)>
- Node 4 forms one 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 9: <4, (7, 8, 9)>
- Node 6 forms one 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 2: <6, (7, 8, 2)>
- Node 7 forms one 3-star with nodes 4, 5, and 6: <7, (4, 5, 6)>
- Node 8 forms one 3-star with nodes 3, 4, and 6: <8, (3, 4, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].
