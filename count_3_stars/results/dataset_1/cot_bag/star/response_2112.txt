Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 3, 6, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 3:
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 7, and 4. So, there is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (2, 7, 4)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8. As there are less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with node 6.

For node 7:
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (3, 4, 8)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 6 and 7. As there are less than 3 neighbors, no 3-star is formed with node 8.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 = 2] 

The unique 3-stars found are: <3, (2, 7, 4)>, and <7, (3, 4, 8)>
