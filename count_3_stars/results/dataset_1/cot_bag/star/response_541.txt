Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to find the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, 8
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6, 8
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 4, 8, 9
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 6, 8
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 2
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 8

Now, calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 contributes 1 3-star
- Node 1 contributes 1 3-star
- Node 2 contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 contributes 1 3-star
- Node 4 contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 contributes 10 3-stars
- Node 8 contributes 10 3-stars
- Node 9 contributes 1 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 38 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars are:
