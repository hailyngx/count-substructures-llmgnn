Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 5
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 5, 6, and 8
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 1
- Node 4 is connected to node 5
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 8
- Node 7 is connected to node 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6, 7, 9
- Node 9 is connected to node 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 13

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<8, (1, 6, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
