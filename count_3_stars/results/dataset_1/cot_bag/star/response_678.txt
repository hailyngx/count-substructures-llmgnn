Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}, and the edges are as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 3, and 5.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 8.

Let's find the 3-stars:

Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
<3, (2, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 6)>, <3, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (3, 6, 7)>

Node 5 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form 4 3-stars.
<5, (3, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 5, 6)>, <5, (4, 5, 6)>, <5, (3, 5, 4)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 4 = 8. Thus, the answer is [8].
