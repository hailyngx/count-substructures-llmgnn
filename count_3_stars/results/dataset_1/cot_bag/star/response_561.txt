Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 6
- Node 1: 3, 9
- Node 2: 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 1, 9
- Node 4: 2, 5, 9
- Node 5: 4
- Node 6: 0, 2, 8, 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 2, 6, 7
- Node 9: 1, 3, 4, 6, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars:

For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{2} = 6 \)
For Node 8: \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \)
For Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 3 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 10 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 5, 9)>
<6, (0, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
