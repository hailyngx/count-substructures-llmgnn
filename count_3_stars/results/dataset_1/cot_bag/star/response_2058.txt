Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
Let's first visualize the graph based on the given information:

There are 10 nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9}
And 26 edges: (0, 3), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 8), (4, 2), (4, 6), (5, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 9), (8, 1), (8, 3), (9, 1), (9, 6)

Let's now identify the nodes that qualify as the center of a 3-star:

- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: {2, 3, 6, 8, 9}
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 6}
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: {0, 1, 2, 8}
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {1, 2, 4, 9}

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each qualifying node:
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 22\)

Therefore, there are 22 unique 3-stars in the graph. Listing them once:
<1, (2, 6, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (3, 6, 2)>, <1, (2, 6, 3)>, <1, (2, 8, 9)>, <1, (6, 8, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (1, 2, 8)>, <3, (2, 1, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (3, 1, 6)>, <2, (3, 1, 8)>
