Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 0) (3, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 4) 

Response:
Let's first represent the graph:

Nodes: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 7), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 0), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 4)

Now, let's identify how many neighbors each node has:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 7)
Node 2: 1 neighbor (0)
Node 3: 1 neighbor (0)
Node 4: 1 neighbor (9)
Node 5: 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8)
Node 6: 2 neighbors (5, 8)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 5, 8)
Node 8: 3 neighbors (5, 6, 7)
Node 9: 1 neighbor (4)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding these up, we have a total of 4 unique 3-stars. So the final result is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 6, 7)>
