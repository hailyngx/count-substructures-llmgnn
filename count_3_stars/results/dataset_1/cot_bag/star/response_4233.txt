Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so it cannot form any 3-stars.

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 26 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [26], and the unique 3-stars formed are:
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 3, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (0, 1, 6)>
<7, (0, 2, 6)>
