Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will count the number of 3-stars centered at each of these nodes.

1. Node 2 has 5 neighbors: (0, 1, 4, 5, 9)
   Total number of 3-stars for Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   Unique 3-stars for Node 2: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>

2. Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (0, 2, 3, 8)
   Total number of 3-stars for Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   Unique 3-stars for Node 4: <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>

3. Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (2, 3, 7, 8)
   Total number of 3-stars for Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   Unique 3-stars for Node 9: <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 10 + 4 + 10 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [24].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <2, (0, 1, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 4, 5)>, <2, (0, 4, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 4, 5)>, <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (4, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 2, 3)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 3, 7)>, <9, (2, 3, 8)>, <9, (2, 7, 8)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>.
