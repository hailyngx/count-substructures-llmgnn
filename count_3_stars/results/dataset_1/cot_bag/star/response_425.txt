Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
We will first identify which nodes have three or more neighbors to potentially form 3-stars. Nodes 4, 5, and 8 have 6 neighbors each, while nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9 have 4 neighbors each. Nodes 2 does not have three or more neighbors, so we will not consider it for forming 3-stars.

For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it can form:
- For nodes 4, 5, and 8, they can each form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- For nodes 0, 1, 3, 6, 7, and 9, they can each form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Calculating this gives a total of \( 3*20 + 6*4 = 84 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [84].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<4, (0, 1, 2)>
<4, (0, 3, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 7)>
<4, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (0, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 9)>
<5, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 3, 9)>
<8, (1, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
