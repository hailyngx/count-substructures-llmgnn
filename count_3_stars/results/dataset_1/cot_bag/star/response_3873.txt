Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
Based on the given information, we can draw the following graph:

Nodes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 8, 10}
Edges: {(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 9), (3, 4), (3, 7), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 5)}

To find the total number of 3-stars, we need to check the nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9

Now we apply the formula $ \binom{n}{3} $ to each of these nodes:

- Node 1: $ \binom{4}{3} = 4 $
- Node 2: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 3: $ \binom{2}{3} = 0 $ (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: $ \binom{1}{3} = 0 $ (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 5: $ \binom{3}{3} = 1 $
- Node 6: $ \binom{1}{3} = 0 $ (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: $ \binom{2}{3} = 0 $ (less than 3 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6], and the unique 3-stars are:

<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 6, 5)>
<1, (2, 9, 5)>
<1, (5, 2, 6)>
<1, (5, 2, 9)>
