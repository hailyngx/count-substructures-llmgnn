Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their neighbors:

- Node 0: 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 4
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 6
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 3, 7, 9
- Node 6: 2, 3, 4
- Node 7: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 7
- Node 9: 5, 7

Let's now find all the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 2: \({4 \choose 3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 5: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 6: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 7: \({5 \choose 3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({3 \choose 3} = 1\) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \(4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 17\) 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [17], and the unique 3-stars found are <2, (1, 4, 6)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (0, 5, 8)>.
