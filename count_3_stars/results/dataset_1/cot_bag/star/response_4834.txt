Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify nodes with three or more neighbors. 
Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- For Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is 5. Thus, we put this inside brackets: [5].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 1, 2, 3>
<2, 3, 4, 6>
<2, 3, 4, 5>
<4, 5, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
