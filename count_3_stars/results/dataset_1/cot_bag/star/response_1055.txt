Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 9) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes that have at least three neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

1. Node 0: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
2. Node 1: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
3. Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
4. Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
5. Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Since each 3-star contributes 1 to the total count, the total number of 3-stars is [20].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<1, (0, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<4, (8, 9, 6)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
<8, (4, 5, 6)>
<9, (2, 4, 6)>
<9, (4, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [20], and the unique 3-stars are listed above.
