Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here is the calculation of the total number of 3-stars in the graph:

For each node that has three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars formed by that node:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (1, 2, 3, 4, 9), so it forms [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars.
Node 3 has 6 neighbors: (0, 2, 4, 7, 8), so it forms [inom{6}{3}] = 20 3-stars.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (4, 5, 7, 9), so it forms [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 3 neighbors: (0, 5, 6), so it forms 1 3-star.

Adding these up: 10 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 35.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>, <0, (1, 3, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 4)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 4, 9)>, <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <3, (0, 2, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>.
