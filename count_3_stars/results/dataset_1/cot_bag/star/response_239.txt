Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 5, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 10 + 20 + 4 = 36 \)

So, there are 36 3-stars in total: [36].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
