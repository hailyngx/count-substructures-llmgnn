Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: inom{6}{3} = 20
- Node 2: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, there are a total of [20 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1] = [22] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, 
<0, (1, 6, 7)>, 
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, 
<0, (2, 6, 9)>, 
<0, (3, 6, 9)>, 
<0, (6, 7, 9)>, 
<7, (2, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (6, 7, 0)>
