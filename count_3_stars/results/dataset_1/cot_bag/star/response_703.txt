Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars and list the unique 3-stars, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 has neighbors 1, 3, 9
- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 3, 6
- Node 2 has neighbors 5, 6, 9
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 1, 6, 9
- Node 6 has neighbors 1, 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors 2, 7
- Node 7 has neighbors 5, 8
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 2, 3, 6

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 21 \) 3-stars formed in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [21].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 3, 9>
- <1, 0, 3, 6>
- <2, 5, 6, 9>
- <3, 0, 1, 6>
- <6, 1, 2, 3>
- <6, 1, 3, 4>
- <6, 1, 9, 3>
- <6, 2, 3, 9>
- <6, 2, 9, 0>
- <6, 2, 9, 3>
- <6, 4, 3, 9>
- <6, 9, 0, 2>
- <6, 9, 0, 3>
- <6, 9, 2, 3>
- <9, 0, 2, 3>
- <9, 0, 3, 6>
- <9, 2, 3, 6>
- <9, 3, 0, 2>
- <9, 3, 0, 6>
- <9, 3, 2, 6>
- <9, 6, 0, 2>
