Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 3, 5, 6
- Node 2: 6
- Node 3: 0, 8
- Node 4: 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 4, 7, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 8
- Node 7: 5
- Node 8: 3, 6
- Node 9: 5

Now we can analyze the nodes to see which ones can form 3-stars:

- Node 0: Can form 1 3-star
- Node 3: Can form 1 3-star
- Node 5: Can form 1 3-star
- Node 6: Can form 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [4].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, 3, 8>
<3, 0, 5>
<5, 0, 6>
<6, 0, 2>
