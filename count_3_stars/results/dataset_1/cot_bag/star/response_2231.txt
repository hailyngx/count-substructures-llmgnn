Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors first:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \).
- For Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- For Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).
- For Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).
- For Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [43] \).

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 3)>
<2, (1, 6, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (8, 7, 9)>
<8, (1, 2, 6)>
<8, (2, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
