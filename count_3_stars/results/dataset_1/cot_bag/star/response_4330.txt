Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph with the given nodes and edges:
```
    1 -- 6 -- 5
   /         / |
  9       0   |
   \     /    |
    3 - 7 --- 4
         |
         2
```

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 42.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42], and the unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 5, 6, 7>
- <0, 6, 7, 9>
- <0, 5, 7, 4>
- <0, 6, 5, 7>
- <0, 7, 4, 5>
- <0, 6, 4, 5>
- <0, 7, 6, 5>
- <4, 5, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 7, 4>
- <6, 7, 4, 5>
- <7, 4, 5, 6>
