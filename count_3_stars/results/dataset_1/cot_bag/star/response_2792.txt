Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now we will identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 3 neighbors
- Node 2: 3 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 5 neighbors

Now we will calculate the total number of 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:

\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{5}{3} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 22 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 7, 9)>
<3, (5, 7, 9)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<7, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (0, 2, 5)>
