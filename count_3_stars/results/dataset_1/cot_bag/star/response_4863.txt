Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 12 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors:

- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 6, 9, and 6.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 2, 5.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 9, 9.

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of 5 3-stars in this graph: [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <3, (0, 6, 9)>
- <6, (3, 9, 9)>
