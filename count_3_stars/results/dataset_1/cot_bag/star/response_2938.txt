Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 6), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (3, 9), (4, 8), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 9), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 0), (8, 4), (8, 7), (9, 0), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7)

Based on the edges, the neighbors of each node are as follows:
- Node 0: 8, 9
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 3, 5
- Node 3: 2, 9
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 1, 9
- Node 7: 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 3, 6, 7

Let's count the number of 3-stars formed at each node:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 1 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 4] = [5] \).
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<8, (0, 4, 7)>
<9, (0, 3, 6)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (3, 6, 7)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
