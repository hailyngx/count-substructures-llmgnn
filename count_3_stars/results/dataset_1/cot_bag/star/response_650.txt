Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the given information, the nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Now, let's construct the graph with the nodes and edges provided:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 2
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 2
- Node 7 is connected to node 2
- Node 8 is connected to node 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 8

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars in this graph by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) to each node with three or more neighbors:

For Node 0 with 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 1 with 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
For Node 2 with 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing up: 4 + 1 + 10 = 15

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<2, (1, 3, 5)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 4, 5)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
