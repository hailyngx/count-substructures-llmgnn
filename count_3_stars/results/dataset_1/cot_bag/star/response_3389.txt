Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

For each node, we will check if it has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 5, 8, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 5, 6. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 7, 9. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 3, 4, 7. So, it can form 1 3-star.
Node 7 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3.
Node 8 has 1 neighbor, which is less than 3.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5. So, it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up the 3-stars for each applicable node, we get a total of 5 3-stars in the graph.

This leads us to the final answer: [5].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (3, 4, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (0, 5, 6)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>.
