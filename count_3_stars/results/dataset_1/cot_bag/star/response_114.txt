Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 10 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (6, 7) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:

Node 1: 3, 8  
Node 3: 1, 8  
Node 4: 7  
Node 6: 7  
Node 7: 4, 6  
Node 8: 1, 3  

We see that nodes 1, 3, and 8 have 2 neighbors, while nodes 4, 6, and 7 have 1 neighbor each.  
Nodes 1, 3, and 8 have the potential to form 3-stars. 

For Node 1:
Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
<1, (3, 8)>

For Node 3:
Node 3 can form 1 3-star.
<3, (1, 8)>

For Node 8:
Node 8 can form 1 3-star.
<8, (1, 3)>

So, there are a total of [3] 3-stars in this graph.
