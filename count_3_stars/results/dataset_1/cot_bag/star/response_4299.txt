Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to node 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 7, 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 9.
- Node 6 is connected to node 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 5, 8.

Let's now identify the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 0 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>.
- Node 4 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <4, (6, 7, 9)>.
- Node 5 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <5, (2, 9, 5)>.
- Node 9 can form inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <9, (4, 5, 8)>.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have [10 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 13 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 9, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 8)>.
