Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: <0, 2, 3, 8>.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: 0 3-star formed 
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars formed

Total number of 3-stars = 0 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 30

Therefore, the final answer is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<2, (1, 3, 4)>
<2, (1, 3, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 8)>
<2, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 8)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 6, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 6, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
