Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to node 2.
- Node 1 is connected to node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 7.
- Node 4 is connected to node 3.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to node 2.

Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 5, thus [5].

Unique 3-stars are:
- <2, (0, 1, 3)>
- <2, (0, 1, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 7)>
