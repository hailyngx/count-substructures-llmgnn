Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 9) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. In this case, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9.

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 18 \).  
So, the final answer inside brackets is [18].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
1. <0, (1, 2, 8)>
2. <0, (2, 4, 8)>
3. <0, (2, 8, 9)>
4. <0, (4, 8, 0)>
5. <2, (0, 3, 8)>
6. <2, (3, 9, 2)>
7. <3, (1, 2, 9)>
8. <3, (2, 4, 8)>
9. <3, (2, 8, 9)>
10. <3, (4, 8, 3)>
11. <4, (0, 3, 8)>
12. <8, (0, 2, 4)>
13. <9, (2, 3, 6)>
14. <9, (3, 5, 9)>
15. <9, (5, 6, 9)>
16. <9, (6, 9, 2)>

Therefore, the final answer is:  
[18]  
<0, (1, 2, 8)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 0)>,  
<2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 9, 2)>,  
<3, (1, 2, 9)>, <3, (2, 4, 8)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 3)>,   
<4, (0, 3, 8)>,  
<8, (0, 2, 4)>,  
<9, (2, 3, 6)>, <9, (3, 5, 9)>, <9, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (6, 9, 2)>
