Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 5 => [1 3-star]

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6 => [1 3-star]

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 5 => [1 3-star]

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 => [1 3-star]

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9 => [1 3-star]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [5].

The unique 3-stars found are: <>
There are no unique 3-stars in this graph.
