Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 1) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let's analyze each node to see if it forms a 3-star:

- Node 0 has neighbors {1, 4, 8, 9} and forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>.

- Node 1 has neighbors {0, 5, 6, 7, 8} and forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>.

- Node 2 has only 1 neighbor {9} so no 3-star is formed.

- Node 3 has neighbors {4} which is less than 3, so no 3-star.

- Node 4 has neighbors {0, 3, 9} and forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: <4, (0, 3, 9)>.

- Node 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 each have at least 3 neighbors, so we calculate inom{deg}{3} for each to find the number of 3-stars formed: 
    - Node 5: <5, (1, 6, 7)>, total 1 3-star.
    - Node 6: <6, (1, 5, 7)>, total 1 3-star.
    - Node 7: <7, (1, 5, 6)>, total 1 3-star.
    - Node 8: <8, (0, 1, 9)>, total 1 3-star.
    - Node 9: <9, (0, 2, 4)>, total 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars, we find a total of 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19 three-stars. Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [19]. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 7)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 1, 9)>, <9, (0, 2, 4)>.
