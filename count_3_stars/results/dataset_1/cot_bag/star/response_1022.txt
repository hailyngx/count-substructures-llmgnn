Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

The degrees of the nodes are:
- Node 0: 4
- Node 1: 3
- Node 2: 3
- Node 3: 2
- Node 4: 1
- Node 5: 2
- Node 6: 2
- Node 7: 4
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 2

Now, let's identify the nodes that can form 3-stars. Nodes with degrees less than 3 cannot form 3-stars, so we'll exclude them.

The nodes that can form 3-stars are: {0, 1, 2, 7}

For each of these nodes, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding them up: 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 10 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 7)>
<7, (0, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 3, 2)>
<7, (2, 1, 3)>
<7, (2, 3, 1)>
