Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will start by examining each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
3-Stars with node 0: 
<0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 9)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 9)>, <0, (1, 8, 9)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 9)>, <0, (6, 8, 9)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>

Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 7, 9
Number of 3-stars with node 1 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
3-Stars with node 1: 
<1, (0, 3, 4)>, <1, (0, 3, 7)>, <1, (0, 3, 9)>, <1, (0, 4, 7)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <1, (0, 7, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 7, 9)>, <1, (4, 7, 9)>

Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 7
Number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
3-Stars with node 3: 
<3, (1, 2, 4)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (2, 4, 7)>, <3, (4, 7, 1)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 20 + 10 + 4 = 34.
So, the answer is [34].
