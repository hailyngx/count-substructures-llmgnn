Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [44].

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 5, 9)>
