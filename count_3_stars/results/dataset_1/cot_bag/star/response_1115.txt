Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph using the provided information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 1), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 8), (8, 7), (9, 1)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: it has 6 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9), so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

For node 5: it has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7), so it forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is 20 + 20 = 40.

So, the final answer is [40].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<5, (0, 1, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
