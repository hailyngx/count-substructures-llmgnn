Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 8
- Node 2: 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 3: 1, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2
- Node 5: 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-star.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for each eligible node gives us a total of 4 3-stars. So, the final answer is [4].
The unique 3-stars are <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <1, (2, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, and <3, (1, 7, 9)>.
