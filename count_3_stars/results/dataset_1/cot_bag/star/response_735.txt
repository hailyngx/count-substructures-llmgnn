Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors. Let's go through each node:

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 8, 9. So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 0 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 7. So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 1 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, 9. So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 2 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 8. So, there is exactly 1 3-star centered at node 3.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7. So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 4 is \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \).

Node 5 has 2 neighbors, which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed around node 5.

Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8. So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 6 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9. So, there is exactly 1 3-star centered at node 7.

Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 6, 9. So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 8 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 7, 8. So, the number of 3-stars centered at node 9 is \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \).

Adding up the 3-stars from each node, we get a total of 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 42 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 8, 9)>
<0, (4, 5, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 2, 5)>
