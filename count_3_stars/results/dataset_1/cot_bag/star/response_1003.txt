Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has 5 neighbors.  
Node 1 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 2 has 3 neighbors.  
Node 3 has 3 neighbors.  
Node 4 has 3 neighbors.  
Node 6 has 4 neighbors.  
Node 9 has 3 neighbors.  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each applicable node:  
Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  
Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars  

Now let's sum up the total number of 3-stars:  
\( 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (1, 2, 7)>  
<0, (1, 3, 4)>  
<0, (1, 6, 7)>  
<0, (2, 3, 6)>  
<0, (2, 6, 7)>  
<0, (3, 4, 6)>  
<0, (3, 6, 7)>  
<1, (0, 2, 7)>  
<1, (0, 4, 9)>  
<6, (0, 3, 5)>
