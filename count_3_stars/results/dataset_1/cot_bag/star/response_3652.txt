Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form. We'll then sum up these counts to find the total number of 3-stars.

Looking at the given graph:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 8, 9
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 2, 4, 5, 6

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these counts together: \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 17 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 17 three-stars in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [17] and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<1, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<1, (2, 3, 8)>, 
<1, (2, 6, 8)>, 
<1, (3, 6, 8)>, 
<2, (5, 7, 9)>, 
<5, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<5, (2, 7, 9)>, 
<5, (3, 7, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (8, 9, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 4, 5)>, 
<9, (4, 5, 6)>.
