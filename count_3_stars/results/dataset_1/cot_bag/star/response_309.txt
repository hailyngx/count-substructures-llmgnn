Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 6) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    0 -- 7
    |    |
    7 -- 4 -- 8
    |    |    |
    6 -- 1    5
     \   |  / |
        9 -- 3
            |
            2
```

Now, we will identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars involving each of these nodes:

- Node 4 has 8 neighbors: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1 3-star
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Summing up these results gives us the total number of 3-stars: 56 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 72

So, there are 72 3-stars in this graph.

Listing the unique 3-stars:
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- <4, (2, 6, 8)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 8)>
- <4, (3, 6, 8)>
- <4, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <6, (1, 4, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 5)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [72].
