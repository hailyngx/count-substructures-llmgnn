Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
This graph consists of the following connections:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 4, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to node 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 2 forms one 3-star: <2, (3, 4, 6)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars: <4, (2, 3, 6)> and <4, (6, 9, 2)>
- Node 6 forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 2, 4)> and <6, (4, 9, 2)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives us a total of [5].
