Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

- Node 0: 1, 4
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 4, 5, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6: 2, 4, 5
- Node 7: 4, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 3, 7, 9
- Node 9: 1, 2, 3, 7, 8

Now, we'll identify the nodes that can form 3-stars:

- Node 1 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 15 3-stars.
- Node 5 can form 10 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 10 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ [10 + 10 + 15 + 10 + 10] = [55] \]

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (0, 4, 2)>
- <2, (1, 5, 3)>
- <4, (0, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 3, 6)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
