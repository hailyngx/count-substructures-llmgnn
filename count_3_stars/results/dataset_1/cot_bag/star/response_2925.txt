Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The given graph can be represented as follows:

- Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
- Edges: (0, 3), (0, 9), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 2), (4, 3), (6, 7), (7, 6)

Let's analyze the nodes:

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors: 3 and 9.
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors: 6 and 9.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor: 4.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9. It forms 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, and 5. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 3. It forms 1 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, and 9. It forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor: 6.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, and 6. It forms 1 3-star.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 

1 3-star from Node 4 + 1 3-star from Node 5 + 10 3-stars from Node 3 + 4 3-stars from Node 6 + 1 3-star from Node 9 = 17 3-stars ([]).

Unique 3-stars found:
- <0, 3, 4>
- <0, 3, 5>
- <0, 3, 6>
- <0, 3, 9>
- <1, 6, 3>
- <1, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 9>
- <2, 4, 3>
- <3, 0, 4>
- <3, 0, 5>
- <3, 0, 6>
- <3, 0, 9>
- <3, 1, 6>
- <3, 4, 2>
- <3, 4, 5>
- <3, 6, 1>
