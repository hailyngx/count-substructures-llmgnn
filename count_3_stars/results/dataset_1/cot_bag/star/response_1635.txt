Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3}=4 \) 3-stars
For node 1: \( \binom{4}{3}=4 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{6}{3}=20 \) 3-stars

Summing these up, we get a total of 28 3-stars, which we will represent as [28].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (1, 8, 9)>
<0, (2, 6, 3)>
<0, (2, 6, 4)>
<0, (2, 6, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 2)>
<1, (4, 6, 2)>
<1, (5, 6, 2)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (0, 1, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 5)>
<6, (4, 5, 3)>
<6, (5, 3, 4)>
<6, (5, 4, 3)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<8, (0, 1, 7)>
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 7)>
<9, (0, 1, 8)>
