Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, we'll first examine each node to see how many neighbors it has. Then, we'll identify the 3-stars formed by nodes that have three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 2 neighbors: (0, 5) and (0, 6).
Node 1 has 7 neighbors: (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 9), (4, 1), (9, 1). 
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: (2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 9).
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 9).
Node 4 has 4 neighbors: (1, 4), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 7).
Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (0, 5), (1, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5).
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (6, 7).
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: (1, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (6, 7).
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: (2, 8), (8, 9).
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (8, 9), (9, 1).

Based on the above analysis:
- Node 1, 3, 4, 5, and 9 each can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- There are no other nodes with three or more neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is \( [5 \times 4 + 1] = [21] \).

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 7)>
- <4, (1, 5, 7)>
- <5, (1, 4, 9)>
- <9, (1, 4, 5)>
