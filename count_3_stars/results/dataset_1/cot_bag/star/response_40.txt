Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine the node degrees:

Node 0: degree 2
Node 1: degree 5
Node 2: degree 2
Node 3: degree 3
Node 4: degree 4
Node 5: degree 1
Node 6: degree 6
Node 7: degree 3
Node 8: degree 1
Node 9: degree 2

Now, let's find the 3-stars:

Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of [10 + 1 + 4 + 20] = 35 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 6)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (3, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (1, 4, 6)>
<1, (1, 2, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (0, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 2, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<6, (1, 3, 7)>
<6, (2, 4, 6)>
<6, (3, 4, 7)>
<6, (4, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
