Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:

0: 4, 9  
1: 7, 9  
2: 5, 6  
3: 6  
4: 0, 7, 8  
5: 2, 8  
6: 2, 3, 8  
7: 1, 4, 8  
8: 4, 5, 6, 7, 9  
9: 0, 1, 8  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 1: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 4: 1 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 = 15, so the final answer is [15].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, 4, 8>
<0, 7, 8>
<1, 9, 8>
<2, 5, 8>
<2, 6, 8>
<4, 7, 8>
<6, 3, 8>
<8, 9, 0>
<8, 9, 1>
<8, 4, 7>
