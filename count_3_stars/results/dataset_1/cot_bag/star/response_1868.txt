Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's analyze the graph to identify the 3-stars:

- Node 0 has neighbors {2, 5}, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 has neighbors {3, 8}, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has neighbors {0, 4, 7, 9}, so it can form 4 3-stars.
  - <2, (0, 4, 7)>
  - <2, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <2, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 3 has neighbors {1, 4}, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has neighbors {2, 3, 7}, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <4, (2, 3, 7)>
- Node 5 has neighbors {0, 6, 8}, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <5, (0, 6, 8)>
- Node 6 has neighbors {5}, so it forms no 3-stars.
- Node 7 has neighbors {2, 4}, so it forms no 3-stars.
- Node 8 has neighbors {1, 5, 9}, so it can form 1 3-star.
  - <8, (1, 5, 9)>
- Node 9 has neighbors {2, 8}, so it forms no 3-stars.

Adding up all the 3-stars identified gives a total of [8].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (0, 4, 7)>  
<2, (0, 4, 9)>  
<2, (0, 7, 9)>  
<2, (4, 7, 9)>  
<3, (1, 4, 8)>  
<5, (0, 6, 8)>  
<8, (1, 5, 9)>  
<4, (2, 3, 7)>
