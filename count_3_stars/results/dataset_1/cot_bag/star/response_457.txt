Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 has 1 neighbor
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

There are two nodes with exactly three neighbors, which are the nodes 1 and 5. 

For node 1:
There is only 1 3-star formed with node 1, and it is <1, (5, 6, 9)>.

For node 5:
There is only 1 3-star formed with node 5, and it is <5, (1, 2, 6)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].
