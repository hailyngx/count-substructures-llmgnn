Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list out the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 5, 9)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8)
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 7)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 9)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed by these nodes:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 1: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1

So, the total number of 3-stars [] = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 9)>
