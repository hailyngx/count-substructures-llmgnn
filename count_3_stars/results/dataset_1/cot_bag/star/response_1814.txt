Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 5, and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 3 and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 6, 7, and 8.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the total number of 3-stars by applying the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Now, summing up the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ 20 + 20 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 68 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars is 68, and we can represent them as follows:
\[ [68] \] 
Unique 3-stars: 
- <0, (1, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
