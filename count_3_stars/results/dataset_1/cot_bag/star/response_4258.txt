Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors so that we can calculate the total number of 3-stars.  

Nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0: 3 neighbors  
Node 2: 2 neighbors  
Node 3: 2 neighbors  
Node 4: 2 neighbors  
Node 5: 3 neighbors  
Node 6: 2 neighbors  
Node 7: 3 neighbors  
Node 8: 3 neighbors  
Node 9: 1 neighbor

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:  
Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, (2, 7, 8)>  
<5, (6, 7, 9)>  
<7, (0, 4, 5)>  
<8, (0, 4, 6)>
