Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 2, 4
- Node 1: 6
- Node 2: 0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Node 3: 2, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 6
- Node 5: 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 2, 9
- Node 8: 3, 5
- Node 9: 2, 5, 7

Now, we'll find the 3-stars based on the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars
- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 5 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 forms inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars
- Node 9 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Adding these up gives a total of [26] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (0, 3, 5)>
<2, (0, 3, 6)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (3, 5, 9)>
<2, (3, 6, 7)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 8, 9)>
<5, (4, 6, 8)>
<5, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (2, 5, 7)>
