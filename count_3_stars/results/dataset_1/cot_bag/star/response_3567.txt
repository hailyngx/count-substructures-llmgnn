Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with more than 3 neighbors: node 0, node 2, and node 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 5, and 7
- Total number of 3-stars for node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, and 8
- Total number of 3-stars for node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9
- Total number of 3-stars for node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars for all nodes: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

The list of unique 3-stars found in the graph is:
<[0, 2, 3], [0, 2, 5], [0, 2, 7], [0, 3, 4], [0, 4, 5], [2, 4, 6], [2, 4, 8], [2, 6, 8], [3, 4, 8], [4, 8, 9]> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 18, which we represent as [18].
