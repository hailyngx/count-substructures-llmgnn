Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's analyze each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 5, 9). So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars formed with Node 0: <0, (2, 3, 5)>,  <0, (2, 3, 9)>, <0, (2, 5, 9)>, and <0, (3, 5, 9)>.

- Node 2 has 2 neighbors: (0, 4). Since it has fewer than 3 neighbors, no 3-stars are formed with Node 2.

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (0, 4, 7, 8, 9). So, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars formed with Node 3: <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (4, 8, 9)>, and <3, (7, 8, 9)>.

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (2, 3, 5, 6, 9). So, there are $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ 3-stars formed with Node 4: <4, (2, 3, 5)>, <4, (2, 3, 6)>, <4, (2, 3, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 6)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, and <4, (6, 8, 9)>.

- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: (0, 4, 9). So, there are $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ 3-stars formed with Node 5: <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, and <5, (4, 6, 9)>.

- Nodes 6, 7, 8, and 9 all have fewer than 3 neighbors, so no 3-stars are formed with them.

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $4 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 28$, which can be represented as $[28]$. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <0, (2, 3, 9)>
- <0, (2, 5, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 9)>
- <3, (0, 4, 7)>
- <3, (0, 4, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 9)>
- <3, (0, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <3, (7, 8, 9)>
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <4, (2, 3, 6)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <4, (2, 5, 6)>
- <4, (2, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (3, 5, 9)>
- <4, (3, 6, 9)>
- <4, (5, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (0, 4, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
