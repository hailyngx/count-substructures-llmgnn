Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph:

```
     1
    / \
   /   \
  8 --- 9
   \   /
    \ /
     |
     2
    /|\
   / | \
  3  4  5
   \ | /
    \|/
     7
```

We can see that nodes 2, 7, and 9 each have 3 or more neighbors, so we need to find the 3-stars from these nodes.

For node 2:
- Neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 5)>, <2, (3, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (4, 5, 7)>

For node 7:
- Neighbors: 2, 3, 9
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <7, (2, 3, 9)>

For node 9:
- Neighbors: 1, 4, 7
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <9, (1, 4, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 1 + 1 = 6].
