Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Based on the given edges, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 8, and 9. 

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
1. Node 0: Since node 0 has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star.
2. Node 2: Since node 2 has 6 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
3. Node 8: Since node 8 has 5 neighbors, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
4. Node 9: Since node 9 has 3 neighbors, it forms 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 20 + 10 + 1 = 32

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [32], and the unique 3-stars found are:
