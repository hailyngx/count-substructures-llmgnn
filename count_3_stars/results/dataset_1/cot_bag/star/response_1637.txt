Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph have the following neighbors:
- Node 0: 2, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 4, 7
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 5
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 0, 7
- Node 9: 0, 7

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)  
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  

Total number of 3-stars: \( 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 8 \)  

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [8].  

The unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (2, 8, 9)>  
<0, (5, 3, 9)>  
<0, (8, 7, 9)>  
<0, (9, 7, 8)>  
<7, (1, 4, 6)>  
<7, (1, 6, 8)>  
<7, (1, 6, 9)>  
<7, (4, 6, 8)>
