Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:  
Node 1: 2, 6  
Node 2: 1  
Node 3: 4, 9  
Node 4: 3, 6, 8  
Node 5: 8  
Node 6: 1, 4, 7, 9  
Node 7: 6, 8  
Node 8: 4, 5, 7, 9  
Node 9: 3, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:  
Node 1: inom{2}{3} = 0  
Node 3: inom{2}{3} = 0  
Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1  
Node 6: inom{4}{3} = 4  
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4  
Node 9: inom{3}{3} = 1  

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 10

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].
The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<4, (3, 6, 8)>  
<6, (1, 4, 7)>  
<6, (4, 7, 9)>  
<6, (4, 9, 8)>  
<8, (4, 5, 7)>  
<8, (5, 7, 9)>  
<8, (7, 9, 6)>  
<9, (3, 6, 8)>  
<9, (6, 8, 4)>  
<9, (8, 4, 5)>
