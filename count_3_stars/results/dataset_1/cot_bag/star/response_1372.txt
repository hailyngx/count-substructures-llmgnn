Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars each can form:

- Node 0: has 3 neighbors (4, 8, 9). It can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3: has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 7, 9). It can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4: has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 7, 9). It can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 5: has 2 neighbors (2, 6). It cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 6: has 4 neighbors (5, 7, 8, 9). It can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7: has 6 neighbors (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9). It can form 20 3-stars.
- Node 9: has 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6, 7). It can form 10 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars [] = 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 + 10 = 43.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (4, 7, 9)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <6, (5, 7, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 7)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 7)>
