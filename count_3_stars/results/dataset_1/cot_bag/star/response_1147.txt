Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the graph with 10 nodes and 28 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

From the edge information provided, the nodes with at least three neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: It has 7 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8). Hence, the number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center = \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

- Node 2: It has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8). The number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

- Node 3: It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 5). The number of 3-stars with node 3 as the center = 1

- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 9). The number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center = 1

- Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (1, 3, 9). The number of 3-stars with node 5 as the center = 1

- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (0, 7), which is less than 3.

- Node 7: It has 2 neighbors (0, 6), which is less than 3.

- Node 8: It has 2 neighbors (0, 2), which is less than 3.

- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors (4, 5), which is less than 3.

Summing up the 3-stars from each relevant node:
\[ [35 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [42] \]

So, there are 42 unique 3-stars in the given graph:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 8)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 8)>, <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 7)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 4)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (0, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>
