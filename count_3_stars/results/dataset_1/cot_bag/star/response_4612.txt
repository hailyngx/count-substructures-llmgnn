Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify the nodes that are connected to exactly three other nodes.

Let's analyze each node:
- Node 0 has neighbors {2, 3, 4, 8}: it has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has neighbors {4, 5, 6}: it has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has neighbors {0, 5}: it has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 5 has neighbors {1, 3, 6}: it has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has neighbors {0, 1, 6, 7}: it has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has neighbors {1, 4, 5}: it has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has neighbors {4, 8}: it has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.
- Node 8 has neighbors {0, 7}: it has only 2 neighbors, so it cannot form any 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 11, which can be written as [11].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 3)>
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 6)>
- <4, (0, 6, 7)>
- <4, (1, 6, 5)>
- <4, (6, 5, 1)>
- <4, (6, 1, 5)>
- <5, (1, 6, 4)>
- <6, (1, 4, 5)>
