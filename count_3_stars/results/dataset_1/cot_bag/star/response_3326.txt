Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 3) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:
```
Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Edges: (0,5), (0,9), (1,3), (1,4), (1,8), (2,7), (3,1), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,9), (4,1), (4,3), (4,8), (4,9), (5,0), (5,3), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (8,4), (9,0), (9,3), (9,4)
```

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 3 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
\[ \binom{4}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 4 + 20 + 4 + 4 = 32 \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [32].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 4, 3)>
- <3, (4, 1, 8)>
- <3, (4, 1, 9)>
- <3, (4, 1, 3)>
- <4, (1, 3, 8)>
- <4, (1, 3, 9)>
- <4, (3, 1, 8)>
- <4, (3, 1, 9)>
