Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

So, the total number of 3-stars formed by this graph is \( 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 30 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [30]. The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 8)>, <1, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (1, 7, 8)>, <5, (0, 1, 7)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 4, 5)>.
