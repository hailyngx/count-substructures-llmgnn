Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 8, 9
Node 1: 3, 4, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 6, 7, 8
Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6
Node 4: 1
Node 5: 3, 7, 9
Node 6: 2, 3
Node 7: 1, 2, 5, 8
Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 7
Node 9: 0, 1, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 1 3-star (0, 8, 9)
Node 1: 1 3-star (1, 8, 9)
Node 3: 1 3-star (3, 1, 5)
Node 7: 4 (3-stars: (7, 1, 2), (7, 1, 5), (7, 1, 8), (7, 2, 8)
Node 8: 1 3-star (8, 0, 2)
Node 9: 1 3-star (9, 0, 5)

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1] = 9

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 9.

Unique 3-stars found:
<0, 8, 9>, <1, 8, 9>, <3, 1, 5>, <7, 1, 2>, <7, 1, 5>, <7, 1, 8>, <7, 2, 8>, <8, 0, 2>, <9, 0, 5>
