Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given information:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9

Edges: (0, 2), (0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 1), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 9), (7, 5), (7, 6), (9, 0), (9, 5), (9, 6)

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph by following the method described earlier:

For node 0: It has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 9), so it can form 1 3-star. 
For node 2: It has 2 neighbors (0, 3), which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
For node 4: It has 2 neighbors (0, 6), which is less than 3, so no 3-star is formed.
For node 5: It has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 6: It has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.
For node 9: It has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 6), so it can form 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 1] = 3.

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 4, 9)>
<5, (1, 7, 9)>
<6, (4, 7, 9)> 

So, the final answer is [3].
