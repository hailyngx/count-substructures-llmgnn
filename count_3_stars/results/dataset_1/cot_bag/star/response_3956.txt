Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Nodes 0 and 4 form a 3-star: <0, (4, 6, 9)>
Nodes 1 and 6 form a 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 9)>
Nodes 1 and 7 form a 3-star: <1, (5, 7, 4)>
Node 2 has only 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has only 1 neighbor.
Nodes 4 and 7 form a 3-star: <4, (0, 7, 9)>
Nodes 6 and 9 form a 3-star: <6, (0, 9, 4)>
Nodes 7 and 9 form a 3-star: <7, (1, 9, 4)>
Node 8 has only 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 5 neighbors, forming two additional 3-stars:
- <9, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>

The total number of 3-stars is [6].
