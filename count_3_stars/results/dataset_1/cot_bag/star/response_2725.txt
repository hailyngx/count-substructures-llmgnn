Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 6
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 5
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 6, 8, and 9
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1 and 2
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 7
- Node 9 is connected to node 3

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 4: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
- Node 8: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 6

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [6].

Let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (5, 6, 7)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <4, (7, 8, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 3)>, <7, (2, 4, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 7)>.
