Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (7, 1) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:

```
    0 -- 4
    | \  | \
    |  \ |  \
    5    6 -- 3
         |   /
         |  /
         1  
         |
         7
         |
         8
         |
         2
         |
         9
```

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) 3-stars with node 0 as the center. The 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 3)>, and <0, (5, 6, 3)>.

Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so there are 3 3-stars with node 1 as the center: <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>, and <1, (7, 8, 2)>.

Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with node 2 as the center.

Node 3 has 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars with node 3 as the center.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars with node 5 as the center.

Node 6 has 3 neighbors, so there are 3 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 4, 3)>, and <6, (1, 7, 8)>.

Node 7 has 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars with node 7 as the center.

Node 8 has 2 neighbors, so there are no 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

Node 9 has 1 neighbor, so there are no 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, and the unique 3-stars are:

<0, (4, 5, 6)>, <0, (4, 6, 3)>, <0, (5, 6, 3)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>, <1, (7, 8, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 3)>, <6, (0, 4, 3)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].
