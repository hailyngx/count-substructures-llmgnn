Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and the edges are as listed.

Let's first create the visual representation of this graph:

```
    0 ----- 2
    | \   / |
    |   1   |
    | /   \ |
    4       3
           / \
    7 --- 6   8
    |   / | \ |
    5  /  9  \|
```

Now let's analyze the nodes:
- Node 0: Degree = 2
- Node 1: Degree = 5
- Node 2: Degree = 3
- Node 3: Degree = 2
- Node 4: Degree = 2
- Node 5: Degree = 1
- Node 6: Degree = 4
- Node 7: Degree = 5
- Node 8: Degree = 3
- Node 9: Degree = 2

Now we need to find the 3-stars in this graph:

For Node 1 and Node 7, we can form 1 3-star each.

For Node 2 and Node 8, we can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 \].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 8)>

So, the final result is \[ 4 \].
