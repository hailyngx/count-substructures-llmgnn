Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph visually:

```
    0 -- 9
    |       \
    9 -- 0   1 -- 7
                 | | \
                 7 4  5
                 |/ /
                 4 - 
```

Now, let's identify the central nodes that have three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, 5, and 7.

For node 0, since it has 2 neighbors (9 and 9), it cannot form any 3-stars.

For node 4, it has 3 neighbors (5, 7, 7), forming 1 3-star: <4, (5, 7, 7)>.

For node 5, it has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 7), forming 1 3-star: <5, (4, 7, 7)>.

For node 7, it has 4 neighbors (1,4,5,1), but it already formed 3-stars with nodes 4 and 5. Thus, it cannot form any additional 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives [2]. 

The unique 3-stars found are <4, (5, 7, 7)> and <5, (4, 7, 7)>.
