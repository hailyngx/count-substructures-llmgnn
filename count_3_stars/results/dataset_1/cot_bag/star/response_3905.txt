Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Adding all these up: 
\( 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 35 = 63 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [63].

The unique 3-stars are:
