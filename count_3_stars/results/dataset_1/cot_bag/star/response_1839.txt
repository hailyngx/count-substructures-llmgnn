Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 2, 3
- Node 1: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 9
- Node 3: 0
- Node 4: 1, 6
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4
- Node 7: 5, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 1, 2

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors to find the number of 3-stars:
- Node 1: forms 3-stars
- Node 2: forms 4 3-stars
- Node 5: forms 1 3-star
- Node 6: forms 2 3-stars
- Node 7: forms 1 3-star
- Node 9: forms 1 3-star

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
\[ \text{Total} = \binom{1}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{1}{3} + \binom{1}{3} = 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 \]

Therefore, there are 9 3-stars in total.
Listing the unique 3-stars inside <>:
<1, (4, 6, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <7, (5, 8, 2)>, <9, (1, 2, 6)>, <1, (6, 4, 9)>, <2, (9, 1, 6)> 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [9].
