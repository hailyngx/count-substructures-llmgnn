Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 5, 8, and 9. Node 1 has exactly 3 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star. 

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for the other nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) possible 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star
For node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) possible 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 1 = 5 \) 

Putting the final number inside brackets, we get [5].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
