Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors: (0, 3), (3, 5), (3, 6).
Node 4 has 6 neighbors: (0, 4), (1, 4), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 0).
Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (6, 7).
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: (1, 7), (2, 7), (7, 6).
Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

Now let's count the 3-stars:

For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up: \( 1 + 20 + 4 + 1 = 26 \)

Therefore, there are 26 unique 3-stars in this graph. 

So, the final answer is [26]. 
The unique 3-stars found are: 
<3, (0, 5, 6)>, 
<4, (0, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (1, 8, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 8, 4)>, 
<4, (0, 9, 4)>, 
<4, (1, 8, 4)>, 
<4, (1, 9, 4)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 7)>, 
<6, (3, 4, 7)>, 
<6, (2, 4, 7)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<7, (1, 2, 6)>
