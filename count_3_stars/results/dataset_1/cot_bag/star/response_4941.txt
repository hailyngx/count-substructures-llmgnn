Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 6)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 3, 9)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (0, 1, 5)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (4, 7, 8)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 0 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 \).

Hence, the final answer is [8].
The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (2, 5, 6)>
- <2, (0, 1, 4)>
- <2, (0, 1, 7)>
- <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- <4, (2, 3, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <9, (7, 8, 4)>
