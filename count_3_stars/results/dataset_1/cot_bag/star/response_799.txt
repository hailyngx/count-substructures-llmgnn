Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8.

For node 0: 
- There are 4 possible 3-stars: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
- The 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 1: 
- There are 3 possible 3-stars: \[ \binom{3}{3} = 1 \]
- The 3-star is <1, (0, 4, 5)>

For node 4:  
- There are 4 possible 3-stars: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
- The 3-stars are <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>,  <4, (2, 5, 7)>

For node 5: 
- There are 5 possible 3-stars: \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
- The 3-stars are <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 2)>, <5, (8, 9, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (7, 9, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 4)>

For node 7: 
- There are 5 possible 3-stars: \[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]
- The 3-stars are <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 4, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>

For node 8: 
- There are 4 possible 3-stars: \[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]
- The 3-stars are <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 33. 

<0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (1, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (8, 9, 2)>, <5, (8, 9, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 6)>, <5, (4, 6, 7)>, <5, (7, 9, 8)>, <5, (6, 7, 4)>, <7, (0, 3, 8)>, <7, (0, 6, 8)>, <7, (0, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (6, 4, 9)>, <7, (8, 9, 5)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>, <8, (5, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 7, 9)>, <8, (0, 5, 9)>
