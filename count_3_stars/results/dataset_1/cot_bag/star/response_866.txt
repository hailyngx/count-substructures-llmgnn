Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given a graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars.

Node 0: Degree 2
Node 1: Degree 3
Node 2: Degree 4
Node 3: Degree 4
Node 4: Degree 4
Node 5: Degree 4
Node 6: Degree 1
Node 7: Degree 4
Node 8: Degree 4
Node 9: Degree 1

So, only nodes 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 have three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-star graphs.

For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<2, (4, 8, 5)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<7, (1, 3, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>

Therefore, the final answer is [24].
