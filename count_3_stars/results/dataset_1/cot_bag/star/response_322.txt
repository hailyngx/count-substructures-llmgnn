Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
In this graph, the nodes that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
  
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of [17] 3-stars in the graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 6, 8)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<3, (1, 4, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 9, 3)>
<9, (2, 3, 4)>
<9, (3, 4, 2)>
