Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph with nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 6.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 1.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 4, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 3.

Next, let's find the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors (1, 5, 7, 9) -> [1]
   <0, (1, 7, 9)>
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 6) -> [1]
   <1, (0, 2, 6)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 7, 9) -> [1]
   <2, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (5, 9) -> [0]
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8) -> [1]
   <4, (2, 5, 8)>
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (0, 3, 4) -> [1]
   <5, (0, 3, 4)>
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 8) -> [1]
   <7, (0, 2, 8)>
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (0, 2, 3) -> [1]
   <9, (0, 2, 3)>

Adding the total number of 3-stars: [6]
