Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 4, 5, 9
- Node 1: 2, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6
- Node 3: 1, 5, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 7
- Node 6: 2, 8
- Node 7: 3, 5, 8
- Node 8: 4, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 3

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: [C(3, 3) = 1]
- Node 1: [C(4, 3) = 4]
- Node 2: [C(3, 3) = 1]
- Node 3: [C(4, 3) = 4]
- Node 4: [C(3, 3) = 1]
- Node 5: [C(4, 3) = 4]
- Node 6: [C(2, 3) = 0]
- Node 7: [C(3, 3) = 1]
- Node 8: [C(3, 3) = 1]
- Node 9: [C(3, 3) = 1]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18].

The unique 3-stars found are:
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (2, 3, 4)>
- <1, (2, 3, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 5, 7)>
- <3, (1, 3, 9)>
- <5, (0, 2, 7)>
- <5, (2, 3, 7)>
- <5, (0, 3, 7)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 7)>
- <9, (0, 1, 3)>
