Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 6) (2, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph:

```
    0 --- 6
   /       |
  6  ----- 1
  |       / 
  5 ---- 2
 /       
5 --- 6 --- 3
|    |          
|    4 --- 7 --- 3
|    |    |    |    
2    8    4    |
     |         |
     9 ---  8 -- 
```

Let's find the 3-stars present in this graph:

- Node 6 forms a 3-star with nodes 0, 1, and 5: <6, (0, 1, 5)>
- Node 4 forms a 3-star with nodes 7, 8, and 3: <4, (7, 8, 3)>

Since all other nodes have fewer than 3 neighbors, we only have these two unique 3-stars in the graph.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2].
