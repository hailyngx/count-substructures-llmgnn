Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 3, and 5. We'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars: <0, (3, 6, 1)> and <0, (6, 1, 8)>

For node 3:
- Node 3 has 2 3-stars: <3, (0, 5, 8)> and <3, (5, 4, 8)>

For node 5:
- Node 5 has 3 3-stars: <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, and <5, (4, 7, 6)>

So, the total number of 3-stars is [2 + 2 + 3] = 7.
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (3, 6, 1)>, <0, (6, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 8)>, <3, (5, 4, 8)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, and <5, (4, 7, 6)>.
