Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see if it can be a center of a 3-star:

- Node 0 has 6 neighbors: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Nodes 6, 7, and 8 have 3 neighbors each: (6: 0, 7, 8), (7: 0, 5, 6), (8: 0, 5, 6)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars formed by each node that can be a center:

- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: \([20 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1]\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 27.

Unique 3-stars found are: <0, (3, 7, 8)>, <0, (4, 7, 8)>, <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <0, (7, 5, 8)>, <0, (7, 6, 8)>, <0, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>
