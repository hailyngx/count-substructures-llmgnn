Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 4) (6, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Here are the nodes with their neighbors:
Node 0: 1, 9
Node 1: 0, 2, 8
Node 2: 1, 4
Node 4: 2, 5, 6, 9
Node 5: 4
Node 6: 4
Node 7: 8
Node 8: 1, 7, 9
Node 9: 0, 4, 8

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors. 
For node 1, we have 1 3-star. <1, (0, 2, 8)>
For node 4, we have 3 3-stars. <4, (2, 5, 6)>, <4, (2, 5, 9)>, <4, (2, 6, 9)>
For node 8, we have 1 3-star. <8, (1, 7, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 3 + 1] = [5].
