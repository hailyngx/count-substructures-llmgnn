Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 8)>
<1, (2, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 3, 4)>
<5, (0, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<8, (1, 5, 9)>
<8, (5, 6, 9)>
