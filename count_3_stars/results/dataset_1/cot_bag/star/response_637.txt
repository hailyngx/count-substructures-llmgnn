Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 2, 6
- Node 2: 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 6
- Node 5: 2, 7
- Node 6: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9
- Node 7: 5, 6
- Node 8: 2
- Node 9: 3, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{0}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

When we sum up the total number of 3-stars, we get a total of 8.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].

Now let's list the unique 3-stars:
<2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>
