Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 3) 

Response:
To start, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 4, 6, and 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 1 has neighbors 3, 6, and 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors 1, 2, 4, and 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 3, and 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors 0, 1, and 5 (3 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up, we have a total of 8 3-stars, which gives us the final count of [8].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (3, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 2, 4)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 9)>
<3, (1, 9, 4)>
<4, (0, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 5)>
