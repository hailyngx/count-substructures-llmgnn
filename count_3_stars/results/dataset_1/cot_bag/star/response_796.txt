Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's draw the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 8), (1, 0), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 0), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 1), (6, 4), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 5), (8, 0), (8, 3), (8, 5), (8, 9), (9, 4), (9, 8)]

```
   1 -- 6       2 -- 7
   |     |     /
   0 -- 8    3 -- 5 
    \   |    |   /
       4    9
```

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 8 \(\rightarrow\) [1 3-star]
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 1 neighbor
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 5, 7, 8 \(\rightarrow\) \([\binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}]\)
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 5, 6, 9 \(\rightarrow\) [1 3-star]
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 7, 8 \(\rightarrow\) \([\binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}]\)
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 5 \(\rightarrow\) \([\binom{3}{3} = 1 \text{ 3-star}]\)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 9 \(\rightarrow\) \([\binom{4}{3} = 4 \text{ 3-stars}]\)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \([1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 14\).

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)> 

So, the final answer is \([14] = 14\).
