Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- For nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star each.
So, a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 \) 3-stars can be formed with these nodes.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (1, 2, 3)>
- <1, (0, 3, 4)>
- <3, (0, 1, 5)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (4, 8, 9)>
- <8, (2, 6, 9)>
- <9, (6, 7, 8)>
