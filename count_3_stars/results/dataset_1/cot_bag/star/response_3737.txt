Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 1) 

Response:
We'll start by listing the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 4, 8  
Node 1: 2, 5, 8, 9  
Node 2: 1, 3, 6, 7, 8  
Node 3: 0, 2  
Node 4: 0  
Node 5: 1  
Node 6: 2, 7  
Node 7: 2, 6  
Node 8: 0, 1, 2  
Node 9: 1  

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)   

There are 1 + 4 + 10 = 15 3-stars in total.  

So, the final answer is [15], and the unique 3-stars found are:  
<0, (3, 4, 8)>  
<1, (2, 5, 8)>  
<1, (2, 8, 9)>  
<2, (1, 6, 7)>  
<2, (3, 6, 7)>  
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
