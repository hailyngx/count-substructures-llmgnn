Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's analyze each node:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, and 7
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0, 2, 3, 7, and 9
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 8, and 9
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 5, and 6
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 0, 6, 7, 8, and 9
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor: 3
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 9, 6
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 8, 9
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 4, 7
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with 3 or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <0, (1, 2, 4)> 
  - <0, (1, 2, 7)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <0, (2, 4, 7)>

- Node 1 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
  - <1, (0, 2, 7)>
  - <1, (0, 2, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 3, 7)>
  - <1, (0, 3, 9)>
  - <1, (2, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (3, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (0, 2, 3)>
  - <1, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <1, (2, 7, 9)>

- Node 2 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <2, (0, 1, 8)>
  - <2, (0, 1, 9)>
  - <2, (1, 8, 9)>
  - <2, (0, 8, 9)>

- Node 4 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <4, (0, 6, 7)>
  - <4, (0, 6, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (6, 7, 8)>
  - <4, (0, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 7, 9)>
  - <4, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (7, 8, 9)>
  - <4, (6, 8, 9)>

- Node 6 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  - <6, (3, 4, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <6, (4, 6, 7)>

- Node 7 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <7, (0, 4, 8)>
  - <7, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <7, (0, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (4, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (0, 4, 9)>
  - <7, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <7, (4, 7, 8)>
  - <7, (6, 8, 9)>
  - <7, (4, 6, 8)>
  - <7, (4, 7, 9)>

- Node 9 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  - <9, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (4, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (1, 4, 6)>
  - <9, (1, 4, 9)>
  - <9, (1, 6, 7)>
  - <9, (4, 6, 9)>
  - <9, (4, 7, 9)>
  - <9, (6, 7, 9)>

So, there are a total of [56] 3-stars in the given graph.
