Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 7, 8
- Node 3: 0, 1, 7
- Node 4: 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 1, 7
- Node 6: 1, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4
- Node 9: 0, 6

Considering the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 3 3-stars
- Node 7 forms 5 3-stars

Therefore, there are a total of [9] 3-stars in this graph. The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 1, 5)>.
