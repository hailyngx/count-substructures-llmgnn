Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are 4 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 1, 6, 8, and 3.
Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1 has 3 neighbors: nodes 6, 7, and 8. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 1.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 2, 4, and 1. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 6.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors: nodes 1, 5, 7, and 1. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars formed with node 8.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors: nodes 2 and 9. Therefore, node 3 does not participate in any 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 1 (from node 1) + 4 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 8) = 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 5, 7)>.
