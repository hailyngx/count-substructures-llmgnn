Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
Calculating the number of 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with three or more neighbors, let's determine the number of 3-stars centered at that node:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 9
   There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star centered at node 0
   <0, (1, 7, 9)>

2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6
   There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star centered at node 1
   <1, (0, 2, 6)>
   
3. Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 1, 5
   Node 2 does not form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.

4. Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 5, 9
   Node 3 does not form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.
   
5. Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 6, 9
   There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star centered at node 4
   <4, (6, 9, 3)>
   
6. Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2, 3
   Node 5 does not form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.
   
7. Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
   There are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star centered at node 6
   <6, (1, 4, 9)>
   
8. Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0, 8
   Node 7 does not form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.
   
9. Node 8 has 1 neighbor: 7
   Node 8 does not form any 3-stars since it has less than 3 neighbors.
   
10. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 6
    There are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars centered at node 9
    <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>, <9, (0, 4, 6)>, <9, (3, 4, 6)>
    
Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 1) + 1 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 6) + 4 (from node 9) = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [8].
