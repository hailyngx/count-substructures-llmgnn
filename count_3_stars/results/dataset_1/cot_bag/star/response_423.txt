Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0 and 2.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 6.
- Node 5 is connected to node 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 7.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 7.

Now, let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: <0, (1, 2, 7)>. So, there are 1 3-star formed with node 0.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, and <2, (1, 3, 7)>. So, there are 3 3-stars formed with node 2.
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: <6, (4, 8, 9)>. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 6.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors: <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, and <7, (0, 8, 9)>. So, there are 3 3-stars formed with node 7.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors: <8, (5, 6, 7)>. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 8.
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors: <9, (3, 6, 7)>. So, there is 1 3-star formed with node 9.

Putting all these together: 
There are a total of [1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1] = 10 3-stars.

Unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (0, 2, 8)>, <7, (0, 2, 9)>, <7, (0, 8, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (3, 6, 7)>.
