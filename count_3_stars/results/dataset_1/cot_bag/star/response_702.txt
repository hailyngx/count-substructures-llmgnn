Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with their neighbors based on the given edge connections:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to node 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 7.
- Node 6 is connected to node 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 7.
- Node 9 is connected to node 3.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [4 + 4 + 4] = [12].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 5, 8)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
<8, (0, 5, 7)>
