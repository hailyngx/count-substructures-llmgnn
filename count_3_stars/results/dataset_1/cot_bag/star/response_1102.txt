Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars can be formed using that node:

- Node 0: It has 4 neighbors (1, 4, 5, 7), so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <0, (1, 4, 5)>
  - <0, (1, 4, 7)>
  - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
  - <0, (4, 5, 7)>

- Node 1: It has 3 neighbors (0, 6, 8), so only 1 3-star can be formed.
  - <1, (0, 6, 8)>

- Node 2: It has 2 neighbors (3, 8), which is less than 3, so no 3-star can be formed.

- Node 3: It has 1 neighbor (2), which is less than 3, so no 3-star can be formed.

- Node 4: It has 3 neighbors (0, 5, 7), so only 1 3-star can be formed.
  - <4, (0, 5, 7)>

- Node 5: It has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 8), so only 1 3-star can be formed.
  - <5, (0, 4, 8)>

- Node 6: It has 3 neighbors (1, 7, 8), so only 1 3-star can be formed.
  - <6, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 7: It has 3 neighbors (0, 4, 6), so only 1 3-star can be formed.
  - <7, (0, 4, 6)>

- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 6), so we can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
  - <8, (1, 2, 5)>
  - <8, (1, 2, 6)>
  - <8, (1, 5, 6)>
  - <8, (2, 5, 6)>

- Node 9: It has 1 neighbor (2), which is less than 3, so no 3-star can be formed.

There are a total of 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 14 3-stars in this graph.
Thus, the total number of 3-stars formed is [14].
