Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 5, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 6 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 2 3-stars.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 2 + 4 + 6 + 3 + 2 = 17.

Therefore, the final answer is [17].

Unique 3-stars:
- <0, (5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 6, 7)>
- <6, (1, 4, 8)>
- <8, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (0, 4)>
