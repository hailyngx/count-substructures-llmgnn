Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.

For node 0, there are 3 3-stars: <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (2, 4, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 7)>.

For node 1, there is 1 3-star: <1, (0, 5, 6)>.

For node 2, there are 3 3-stars: <2, (0, 4, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (4, 5, 6)>.

For node 3, there is 1 3-star: <3, (2, 6, 9)>.

For node 4, there is 1 3-star: <4, (2, 6, 7)>.

For node 5, there is 1 3-star: <5, (1, 8, 2)>.

For node 6, there is 1 3-star: <6, (1, 3, 7)>.

For node 8, there is 1 3-star: <8, (5, 9, 6)>.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is [12].

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].
