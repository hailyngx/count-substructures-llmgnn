Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: 3, 4, 6
- Node 2: 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 5, 8
- Node 5: 4, 6
- Node 6: 0, 5, 8
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 9: 2, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars centered at each node:
- Node 0: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4

Since nodes 0, 3, and 8 have 3 or more neighbors, we can form a total of 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [9], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 2, 7)>
<3, (0, 2, 8)>
<3, (0, 7, 8)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
