Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    0 -- 4
   /|\   |
  / | \  |
 8  5-- 1
 |     / \
  \   /   \
   9 3--7--6
```

Now, let's analyze each node to see how many 3-stars are formed:

1. Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 4, 5, and 8 - forming 1 3-star.
2. Node 1 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, 8 - forming 1 3-star.
3. Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, 9 - forming 4 3-stars: (3, 1, 7), (3, 1, 8), (3, 7, 6), (3, 8, 9).
4. Node 4 has 1 neighbor - no 3-star formed.
5. Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 6, 9 - forming 1 3-star: (5, 0, 8).
6. Node 6 has 2 neighbors - no 3-star formed.
7. Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 3, 6, forming 1 3-star: (7, 3, 1).
8. Node 8 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 9 - forming 1 3-star: (8, 0, 5).
9. Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 8 - forming 1 3-star: (9, 3, 5).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 9. 
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<3, (1, 7, 6)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (0, 8, 1)>, <7, (3, 1, 7)>.
