Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 4, 7
Node 1: 2, 6
Node 2: 1, 4, 6
Node 3: 0, 5, 6
Node 4: 0, 2
Node 5: 3, 8
Node 6: 1, 2, 3, 8
Node 7: 0, 9
Node 8: 5, 6
Node 9: 7

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 1 3-star
- Node 2: 1 3-star
- Node 3: 1 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 7 \). 
Thus, the final answer is [7].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 4, 6)>
<3, (0, 5, 6)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (2, 3, 8)>
