Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 1) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors.
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors.

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

We don't need to calculate for the other nodes because they have less than 3 neighbors.

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( 10 + 4 + 20 = 34 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (0, 5, 6)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 0)>
<4, (5, 8, 7)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (1, 4, 8)>
<5, (1, 5, 7)>
<5, (1, 5, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 6, 0)>
<5, (4, 6, 7)>
<5, (4, 7, 0)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 0)>
<5, (4, 8, 7)>
<5, (6, 0, 7)>
<5, (6, 7, 8)>
<5, (7, 0, 8)>
<5, (7, 9, 0)>
<7, (0, 8, 5)>
<8, (0, 4, 5)>
<8, (4, 5, 0)>
<8, (4, 5, 7)>
<8, (5, 0, 7)> 

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].
