Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 36 edges, let's determine the 3-stars and calculate the total number of 3-stars formed. 

The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 6, 8
- Node 4: 1, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 6: 3, 7, 9
- Node 7: 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 5, 6, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- For Node 0, there are 1 3-star.
- For Node 3, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 5, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- For Node 9, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars gives: 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 19. So there are 19 3-stars in total.

List of unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 3, 5)>
<3, (0, 1, 5)>
<3, (0, 5, 8)>
<3, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 6, 8)>
<9, (5, 6, 8)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 19, and the unique 3-stars are as listed above.
