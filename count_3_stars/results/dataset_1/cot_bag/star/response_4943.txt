Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 6, and 7.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 6.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 4.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Counting all the 3-stars, we have a total of 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 20 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [20], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 6)>, <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 8)>.
