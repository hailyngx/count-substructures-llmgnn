Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
In this graph, each node and its neighbors can be represented as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 5
- Node 2: 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 3: 7, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 2, 7
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6: 0, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 3, 6, 7, 8

We can now identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 6 neighbors
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 4 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 50 3-stars. So, the final answer is [50].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 5, 7)>
<0, (1, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
<5, (0, 1, 8)>
<5, (0, 2, 7)>
<5, (0, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (6, 0, 7)>
<5, (6, 0, 8)>
<5, (7, 0, 2)>
<5, (7, 0, 8)>
<5, (7, 2, 4)>
<5, (7, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 2, 5)>
<7, (0, 2, 8)>
<7, (0, 3, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 2, 7)>
<8, (0, 3, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 5)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (3, 7, 9)>
