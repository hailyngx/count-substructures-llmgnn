Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are: 0, 1, 2, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

Node 0: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star
Node 1: \(\binom{2}{3}\) = 0 3-stars (less than 3 neighbors)
Node 2: \(\binom{4}{3}\) = 4 3-stars
Node 8: \(\binom{7}{3}\) = 35 3-stars
Node 9: \(\binom{3}{3}\) = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 35 + 1 = 41

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [41]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 1, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (1, 8, 9)>
<2, (5, 0, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>

<8, (2, 5, 9)>
<8, (3, 8, 4)>
<8, (3, 8, 6)>
<8, (3, 8, 7)>
<8, (4, 8, 6)>
