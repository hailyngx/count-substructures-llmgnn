Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors

Now, we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- For nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8: \( \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 6 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 17 \)
- There are no 3-stars for nodes 6 and 9 because they have less than 3 neighbors.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [17]. 

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 1, 4)>
<4, (0, 2, 7)>
<7, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
