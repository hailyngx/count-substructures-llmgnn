Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as they are potential centers of 3-stars. 

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: There are 2 nodes connected to node 0 (7, 8). Thus, there are inom{2}{3} = 0 3-stars.
- Node 2: There are 5 nodes connected to node 2 (3, 5, 7, 8, 9). Thus, there are inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars. These 3-stars are <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 9)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 9)>, <2, (3, 8, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>.
- Node 3: There are 3 nodes connected to node 3 (2, 4, 8). Thus, there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star, which is <3, (2, 4, 8)>.
- Node 5: There are 4 nodes connected to node 5 (1, 2, 7, 9). Thus, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>.
- Node 7: There are 3 nodes connected to node 7 (0, 2, 5). Thus, there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star, which is <7, (0, 2, 5)>.
- Node 8: There are 4 nodes connected to node 8 (0, 2, 3, 9). Thus, there are inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. The 3-stars are <8, (0, 2, 3)>, <8, (0, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 9)>.
- Node 9: There are 3 nodes connected to node 9 (2, 5, 8). Thus, there are inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star, which is <9, (2, 5, 8)>.

Summing up the number of 3-stars for each node, we get a total of 21 3-stars. Therefore, the answer is [21].
