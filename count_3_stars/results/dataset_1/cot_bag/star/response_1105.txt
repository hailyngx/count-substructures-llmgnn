Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 44 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now we can calculate the total number of 3-stars:  
Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)  
Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)  
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)  

Summing these up:  
\[ \text{Total 3-stars} = 20 + 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 54 \]

Therefore, there are 54 3-stars in this graph.  

Unique 3-stars:  
<0, (1, 6, 8)>  
<0, (2, 6, 7)>  
<0, (6, 8, 9)>  
<1, (0, 6, 8)>  
<1, (2, 6, 8)>  
<1, (6, 8, 9)>  
<2, (0, 6, 7)>  
<6, (0, 1, 8)>  
<6, (0, 8, 9)>  
<8, (0, 1, 6)>
