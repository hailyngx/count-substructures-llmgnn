Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. These nodes are: 0, 3, 7, and 9.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it contributes 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it contributes \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Putting it all together, we have a total of 25 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [25]. The unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>.
