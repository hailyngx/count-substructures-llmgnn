Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph to see the connections between the nodes:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges: 
- 0 is connected to 1 and 5
- 1 is connected to 0, 4, 5, and 8
- 2 is connected to 4 and 7
- 3 is connected to 7
- 4 is connected to 1, 2, 6, and 8
- 5 is connected to 0 and 1
- 6 is connected to 4 and 9
- 7 is connected to 2, 3, and 9
- 8 is connected to 1 and 4
- 9 is connected to 6 and 7

Let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 1, 4, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [9].

Listing the unique 3-stars:
<1, (0, 5, 8)>, <1, (5, 0, 8)>, <1, (5, 4, 0)>, <1, (5, 4, 8)>,
<4, (1, 2, 6)>, <4, (2, 1, 6)>, <4, (6, 1, 2)>, <4, (6, 1, 8)>,
<7, (2, 3, 9)>
