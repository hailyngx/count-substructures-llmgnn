Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph with the given nodes and edges.  

The graph can be represented as follows:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 3, 4, and 8.

Next, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors, as these are potential centers of 3-stars: nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 9.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 10+1+1+1+4 = 17 3-stars.

Thus, the final answer is [17].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph:

<0, (1, 2, 4)>, <0, (1, 2, 9)>, <0, (1, 4, 9)>, <0, (2, 3, 9)>, 
<0, (4, 9, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 9)>, 
<9, (0, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 4)>
