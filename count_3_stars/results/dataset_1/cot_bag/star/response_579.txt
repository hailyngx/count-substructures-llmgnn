Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 1:  \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 2:  \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 3:  \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 4:  \({{4}\choose{3}} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 6:  \({{2}\choose{3}} = 0\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star
- Node 9:  \({{3}\choose{3}} = 1\) 3-star

The total number of 3-stars is \(1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 15\).

So, we have a total of 15 unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (2, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (4, 9, 0)>, <2, (1, 4, 8)>, <2, (4, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (0, 1, 6)>, <4, (1, 2, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <8, (2, 3, 7)>.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [15].
