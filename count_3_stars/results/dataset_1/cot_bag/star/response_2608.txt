Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (7, 8, 3)
Node 1: 3 neighbors (2, 3, 9)
Node 2: 2 neighbors (1, 7)
Node 3: 6 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8)
Node 4: 3 neighbors (3, 7, 8)
Node 5: 2 neighbors (3, 9)
Node 6: 2 neighbors (3, 8)
Node 7: 3 neighbors (0, 2, 4)
Node 8: 5 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 6, 9)
Node 9: 3 neighbors (1, 5, 8)

Now, let's count the number of 3-stars for each node that has three or more neighbors:
\[ \binom{3}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{6}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{3}{3} + \binom{2}{3} + \binom{3}{3} = 1 + 1 + 20 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 35\]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [35].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found:
1. <0, (3, 7, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 3, 9)>
3. <3, (0, 1, 4)>
4. <3, (0, 5, 6)>
5. <3, (4, 7, 8)>
6. <3, (8, 4, 7)>
7. <8, (0, 3, 4)>
