Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three neighbors in this graph: nodes 2, 3, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 2:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The unique 3-stars with node 2 as the center are: <2, (3, 6, 9)> and <2, (6, 7, 9)>

For node 3:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The unique 3-stars with node 3 as the center are: <3, (1, 2, 6)> and <3, (3, 5, 8)>

For node 6:
Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
The unique 3-star with node 6 as the center is: <6, (2, 3, 8)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from the three nodes gives us 12 in total. So, we put this final number inside brackets:

[12]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 9)>, <3, (1, 2, 6)>, <3, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 3, 8)>
