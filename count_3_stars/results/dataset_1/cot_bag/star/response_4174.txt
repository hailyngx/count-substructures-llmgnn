Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we need to identify nodes with three or more neighbors first. Then, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars each of these nodes can form and sum them up. 

Let's analyze the nodes with their respective neighbors:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 5, 9)
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (3, 7, 8)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 5, 7)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (0, 3, 4, 8)
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 8, 9)
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 9)
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 6, 9)
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 8)

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Summing these up: 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 = 26

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [26].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (4, 5, 9)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <5, (0, 4, 8)>
- <6, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (2, 4, 9)>
- <8, (1, 6, 9)>
- <9, (0, 6, 7)>
