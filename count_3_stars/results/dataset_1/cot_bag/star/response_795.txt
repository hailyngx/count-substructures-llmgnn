Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 2, 3, 4, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
- Node 2: 0, 5, 6, 7
- Node 3: 0, 1, 8, 9
- Node 4: 0, 1, 8
- Node 5: 2, 8
- Node 6: 1, 2, 7, 8
- Node 7: 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Node 9: 0, 3, 7, 8

Applying the conditions given earlier, we find the following:

- Node 0 can form 1 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form 1 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 1 3-stars.
- Node 3 can form 1 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-stars.
- Node 8 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-stars.

Summing them up gives the final count: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 12.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [12].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 3, 8>
- <1, 4, 8>
- <2, 7, 8>
- <6, 8, 9>
