Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph based on the given information:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 7.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3 and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 1.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to node 0.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to node 4.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4 and 7.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 5, 7) => 1 3-star.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 4, 6) => 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (nodes 2, 6, 8, 9) => \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 9) => 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1] = 7.

The unique 3-stars in this graph are:
<0, (2, 5, 7)>
<2, (0, 4, 6)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 6, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (2, 8, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
