Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor (node 4)
- Node 1: 5 neighbors (nodes 2, 4, 6, 7, 9)
- Node 2: 4 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 7, 8)
- Node 4: 6 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7)
- Node 5: 3 neighbors (nodes 4, 6, 7)
- Node 6: 5 neighbors (nodes 1, 4, 5, 7, 8)
- Node 7: 7 neighbors (nodes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)
- Node 8: 3 neighbors (nodes 2, 6, 7)
- Node 9: 2 neighbors (nodes 1, 7)

The total number of 3-stars formed by each node with three or more neighbors is:
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [10 + 4 + 20 + 10 + 35] = [79] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, 2, 4>
- <1, 2, 6>
- <1, 2, 7>
- <1, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 7>
- <1, 4, 9>
- <2, 4, 6>
- <2, 4, 7>
- <4, 6, 7>
