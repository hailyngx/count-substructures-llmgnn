Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of those nodes.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0 has 2 3-stars.
Node 1 has 2 3-stars.
Node 3 has 2 3-stars.
Node 4 has 4 3-stars.
Node 5 has 2 3-stars.
Node 6 has 2 3-stars.
Node 8 has 4 3-stars.
Node 9 has 2 3-stars.

Adding up the total number of 3-stars for these nodes: 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 20.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [20]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 9)>, <3, (2, 6, 9)>, <4, (1, 5, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <9, (1, 7, 8)>.
