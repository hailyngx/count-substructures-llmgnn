Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 8) (3, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the graph can be illustrated as follows:
```
    0 --- 1 --- 5
        \  |   |
          7   3
          |      
          4    8 --- 2
              / |
            9   |
             \  6
               \|
```

Let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has neighbors 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 8 has neighbors 2, 4, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars:
- For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- For node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [2].

The unique 3-stars are: <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (8, 4, 9)>.
