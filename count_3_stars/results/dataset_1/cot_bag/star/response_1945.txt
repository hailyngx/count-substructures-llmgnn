Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 9
- Node 2: 4, 7
- Node 3: 1, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 6, 9
- Node 8: 3, 4, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8

Calculating the number of 3-stars formed with each node that has at least 3 neighbors:
- Node 0 forms \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 forms \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.

Adding them up: 10 + 4 + 20 + 20 = 54.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54], and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 5, 9)>
<0, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 4, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
