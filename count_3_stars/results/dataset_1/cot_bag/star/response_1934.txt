Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (8, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 2, 5
Node 1: 0, 2
Node 2: 0, 1, 7
Node 3: 6, 7
Node 4: 6
Node 5: 0, 8
Node 6: 3, 4, 9
Node 7: 2, 3, 9
Node 8: 5
Node 9: 6, 7

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:

Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding them up, we get a total of 4 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [4].

The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 2, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>.
