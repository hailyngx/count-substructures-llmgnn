Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0: neighbors - 7, 8
Node 1: neighbors - 5, 7
Node 2: neighbors - 5, 8
Node 3: neighbors - 4, 5, 8
Node 4: neighbors - 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 5: neighbors - 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
Node 6: neighbors - 5, 9
Node 7: neighbors - 0, 1, 4
Node 8: neighbors - 0, 2, 3, 4
Node 9: neighbors - 4, 6

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: 0 3-stars
Node 1: 0 3-stars
Node 2: 0 3-stars
Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
Node 4: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 5: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
Node 6: 0 3-stars
Node 7: 0 3-stars
Node 8: inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars
Node 9: 0 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 25

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars:
<3, (4, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 8)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 8, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 6)>
<5, (1, 4, 6)>
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (2, 4, 6)>
<8, (0, 3, 4)>
<8, (0, 4, 9)>
<8, (2, 3, 4)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (3, 4, 9)>
