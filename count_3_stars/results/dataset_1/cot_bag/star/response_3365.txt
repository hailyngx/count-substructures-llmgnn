Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (5, 9) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 5) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors first:
- Node 0 has neighbors 3, 4, and 9.
- Node 1 has neighbors 4 and 9.
- Node 2 has neighbors 3 and 8.
- Node 3 has neighbors 0, 2, and also 2 incoming edges from 0 and 4.
- Node 4 has neighbors 0, 1, and also 2 incoming edges from 1 and 3.
- Node 9 has neighbors 0, 1, and 5.

Next, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 4 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
- Node 9 forms 1 3-star.

Now, summing up these 3-stars gives: 
\[ [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [5] \]

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 5.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 3, 4, 9>
- <1, 4, 0, 9>
- <3, 0, 2, 4>
- <4, 1, 0, 9>
- <9, 0, 1, 5>
