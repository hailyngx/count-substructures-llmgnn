Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's determine the degree of each node based on the given edges:

- Node 0: degree 2
- Node 1: degree 6
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 6
- Node 4: degree 5
- Node 5: degree 5
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

From the degrees, we see that nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 have 3 or more neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars around these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars is \( [20 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10] = 80 \).

The unique 3-stars are:
- <1, (3, 5, 9)>
- <1, (4, 5, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 9)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 8)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 9)>
- <4, (6, 8, 9)>
- <4, (5, 8, 9)>
- <5, (8, 7, 9)>
- <5, (3, 8, 9)>
- <5, (3, 7, 9)>
- <8, (7, 9, 6)>
- <8, (3, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 3, 7)>
- <9, (1, 4, 7)>
- <9, (3, 4, 7)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
