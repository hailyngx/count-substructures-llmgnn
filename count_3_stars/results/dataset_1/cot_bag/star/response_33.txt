Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, the nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Let's find the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 25

Therefore, there are 25 3-stars in this graph.
