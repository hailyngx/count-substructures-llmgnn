Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 4 neighbors each (nodes 4, 8, and 9). Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) -> There are 4 unique 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) -> There are 4 unique 3-stars with node 8 as the center.

Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) -> There are 10 unique 3-stars with node 9 as the center.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

So the final answer is [18].

The unique 3-stars are: <4, (1, 9, 8)>, <4, (1, 9, 8)>, <4, (9, 8, 1)>, <4, (9, 8, 1)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (0, 6, 7)>, <8, (6, 7, 0)>, <8, (6, 7, 0)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 3)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 2, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 3, 4)>, <9, (2, 4, 1)>, <9, (2, 4, 1)>
