Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph are 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed around each of these nodes based on the formula mentioned earlier:

1. Node 0: 
    - Number of possible 3-stars: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \)

2. Node 1: 
    - Number of possible 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <1, (4, 7, 8)>

3. Node 4: 
    - Number of possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>

4. Node 6: 
    - Number of possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>

5. Node 7: 
    - Number of possible 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <7, (1, 3, 6)>

6. Node 8: 
    - Number of possible 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - Unique 3-star: <8, (0, 2, 6)>

7. Node 9: 
    - Number of possible 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
    - Unique 3-stars: <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>

Combining all the unique 3-stars together, we have: 
\[ [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [15] \]

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, (4, 7, 8)>, <4, (1, 3, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 9)>, <4, (6, 7, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (5, 7, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 2, 6)>, <9, (2, 3, 5)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>
