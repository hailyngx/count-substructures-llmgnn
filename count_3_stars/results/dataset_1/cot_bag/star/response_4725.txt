Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
To determine the 3-stars in this graph, we will analyze each node, checking if it has three or more neighbors. 

For each node with three or more neighbors, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars it can form. 
Here are the results:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: (3, 4, 6, 8, 9)
  Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  3-stars: <0, (3, 4, 6)>, <0, (3, 4, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <0, (3, 6, 9)>, <0, (4, 8, 9)>

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: (2, 3, 5, 7)
  Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
  3-stars: <1, (2, 3, 5)>, <1, (2, 3, 7)>, <1, (2, 5, 7)>, <1, (3, 5, 7)>

- Node 3 has 5 neighbors: (0, 1, 4, 7, 8)
  Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 4)>, <3, (0, 1, 7)>, <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 7)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 7)>, <3, (1, 4, 8)>, <3, (1, 7, 8)>, <3, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (0, 7, 8)>

- Node 4 has 5 neighbors: (0, 3, 6, 7, 8)
  Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  3-stars: <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <4, (0, 3, 7)>, <4, (0, 3, 8)>, <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 6, 7)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (6, 7, 8)>, <4, (0, 7, 8)>

- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: (0, 3, 4, 6, 9)
  Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
  3-stars: <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <8, (0, 3, 6)>, <8, (0, 3, 9)>, <8, (0, 4, 6)>, <8, (0, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 9)>, <8, (3, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>, <8, (0, 6, 9)>

In total, there are 10 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44 3-stars in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is given by [44].
