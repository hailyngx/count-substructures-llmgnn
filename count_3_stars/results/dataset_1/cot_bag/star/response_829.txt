Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node:
- Node 0: 5
- Node 1: 9
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 4
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5
- Node 5: 0, 4, 6, 8
- Node 6: 2, 5, 8
- Node 8: 5, 6
- Node 9: 1

Now, we can identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \):
- Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (As it has only 2 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (One 3-star)
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) (Four 3-stars)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (One 3-star)
- Node 8: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (As it has only 2 neighbors)

Total number of 3-stars: 1 + 4 + 1 = 6
So, the total number of 3-stars is [6].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <4, (2, 3, 5)>
- <5, (0, 4, 6)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 2, 4)>
- <5, (6, 4, 8)>
- <6, (2, 5, 8)>
