Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
Based on the provided information, we can construct the graph as follows:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 5.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 5, and 9.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 3, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, and 9.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 8.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 4, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8.

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

For each node with three or more neighbors, we calculate the number of 3-stars it can form:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star with those neighbors.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star with those neighbors.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 54

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [54].

The unique 3-stars are: 
- <0, (2, 7, 8)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <0, (5, 7, 8)>
- <0, (5, 7, 9)>
- <0, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 7, 9)>
- <1, (3, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 9)>
- <1, (6, 8, 9)>
- <3, (4, 7, 8)>
- <7, (4, 8, 9)>
