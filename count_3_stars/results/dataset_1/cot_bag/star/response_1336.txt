Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 2, 5  
Node 1: 2, 4, 6  
Node 2: 0, 1, 7, 9  
Node 3: 8  
Node 4: 1, 9  
Node 5: 0, 9  
Node 6: 1, 9  
Node 7: 2, 9  
Node 8: 3, 9  
Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  

Let's find the total number of 3-stars in this graph. 

For Node 0: [no 3-stars]
For Node 1: [no 3-stars]
For Node 2: ${4 \choose 3} = 4$
For Node 3: [no 3-stars]
For Node 4: [no 3-stars]
For Node 5: [no 3-stars]
For Node 6: [no 3-stars]
For Node 7: [no 3-stars]
For Node 8: [no 3-stars]
For Node 9: ${6 \choose 3} = 20$

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is $4 + 20 = 24$. 

Therefore, the final answer is [24]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: <2, (1, 4, 9)>, <2, (1, 6, 9)>, <2, (4, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 9, 0)>.
