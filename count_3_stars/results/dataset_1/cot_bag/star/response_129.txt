Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0:
- has neighbors: 1, 3, 8
- can form 1 3-star

Node 3:
- has neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 5, 8
- can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Node 4:
- has neighbors: 3, 6, 8
- can form 1 3-star

Node 5:
- has neighbors: 3, 6
- cannot form a 3-star

Node 6:
- has neighbors: 4, 5, 9
- can form 1 3-star

Node 8:
- has neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 9
- can form inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Node 9:
- has neighbors: 6, 7, 8
- can form 1 3-star

Adding up the 3-stars from all relevant nodes: 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 18

Therefore, there are a total of [18] 3-stars in the given graph.
The unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 4)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, and <8, (0, 4, 9)>.
