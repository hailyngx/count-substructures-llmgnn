Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (8, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
         0
         |
         9
        /|\
       1 3 4
      /| | | \
     6 2 5 9 5
         /|\
        6 3 4
         |
         7
```

Let's now find the total number of 3-star subgraphs in this graph. 

Node 1 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 9) forming 1 3-star. (1, 3, 6, 9)
Node 2 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 3 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 5, 9) forming 4 3-stars. (3, 1, 2, 5), (3, 1, 5, 9), (3, 2, 5, 9), (3, 1, 2, 9)
Node 4 has 2 neighbors, not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 5 has 4 neighbors (3, 4, 6, 9) forming 4 3-stars. (5, 3, 4, 6), (5, 3, 4, 9), (5, 3, 6, 9), (5, 4, 6, 9)
Node 6 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 5) forming 1 3-star. (6, 1, 2, 5)
Node 7 has only 1 neighbor, not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 8 has only 1 neighbor, not enough to form a 3-star.
Node 9 has 6 neighbors (0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6) forming 6 3-stars. (9, 0, 1, 3), (9, 0, 3, 4), (9, 0, 4, 5), (9, 0, 5, 6), (9, 1, 3, 4), (9, 1, 5, 6)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 6] = [16].

The unique 3-stars are found to be <1, 3, 6, 9>, <3, 1, 2, 5>, <3, 1, 5, 9>, <3, 2, 5, 9>, <3, 1, 2, 9>, <5, 3, 4, 6>, <5, 3, 4, 9>, <5, 3, 6, 9>, <5, 4, 6, 9>, <6, 1, 2, 5>, <9, 0, 1, 3>, <9, 0, 3, 4>, <9, 0, 4, 5>, <9, 0, 5, 6>, <9, 1, 3, 4>, <9, 1, 5, 6>.
```
So, the total number of 3-stars is [16].
