Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 4) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 8
- Node 1: 0, 2, 5
- Node 2: 1, 3, 9
- Node 3: 0, 2, 5, 7
- Node 4: 5, 6, 9
- Node 5: 1, 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 4
- Node 7: 3
- Node 8: 0, 9
- Node 9: 2, 4, 5, 8

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
For node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4] = 16.

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 8)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 9)>, <3, (0, 2, 5)>, <4, (5, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (2, 4, 5)>

So, the final answer is [16].
