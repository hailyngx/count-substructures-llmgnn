Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars formed with each of those nodes.

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding up all the 3-stars gives a total of \( 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 13 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 7, 9)>, <1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 4, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 6, 7)>, <7, (0, 3, 4)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <9, (0, 3, 6)>.
