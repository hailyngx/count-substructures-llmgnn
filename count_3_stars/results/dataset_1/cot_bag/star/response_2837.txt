Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 26 3-stars in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [26].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 4, 9)>
<1, (1, 7, 9)>
<1, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (5, 7, 8)>
<4, (5, 7, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 4, 9)>
<5, (2, 3, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 6)>
<5, (3, 4, 5)>
<5, (4, 6, 3)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (1, 9, 3)>
<7, (4, 9, 1)>
<7, (4, 9, 3)>
<9, (1, 3, 4)>
<9, (1, 3, 9)>
<9, (3, 4, 1)>
<9, (3, 4, 9)>
