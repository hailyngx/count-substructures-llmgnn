Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's analyze each node to see which nodes it is connected to:

- Node 0 is connected to: {2, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 1 is connected to: {4, 6, 7, 8}
- Node 2 is connected to: {0, 5, 7, 8}
- Node 3 is connected to: {9}
- Node 4 is connected to: {0, 1, 5, 6, 9}
- Node 5 is connected to: {2, 4, 8}
- Node 6 is connected to: {1, 4, 7, 9}
- Node 7 is connected to: {0, 1, 2, 6}
- Node 8 is connected to: {1, 2, 5, 9}
- Node 9 is connected to: {0, 3, 4, 6, 8}

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 1 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 2 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 5 3-stars.
- Node 6 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 7 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 4 3-stars.
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars formed: [29]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 9)>
<6, (1, 4, 7)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<8, (1, 2, 5)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
