Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 1) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 6, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 7, 9)>
- <4, (6, 7, 9)>
- <6, (0, 1, 4)>
- <6, (0, 4, 5)>
- <6, (1, 4, 7)>
- <6, (1, 5, 7)>
- <7, (1, 3, 4)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
