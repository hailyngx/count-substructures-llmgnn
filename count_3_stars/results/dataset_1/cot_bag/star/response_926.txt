Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6
- Node 4: 2, 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4
- Node 6: 2, 3
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 9
- Node 9: 4, 8

Let's calculate the 3-stars for each node that has at least 3 neighbors:

Node 0:
- Form 3-stars: [\({4 \choose 3}\) + \({4 \choose 3}\)] = [4 + 4] = [8]
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (3, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 5)>

Node 3:
- Form 3-stars: [\({4 \choose 3}\) + \({4 \choose 3}\)] = [4 + 4] = [8]
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 4, 5)>, <3, (5, 4, 6)>

Node 4:
- Form 3-stars: [\({4 \choose 3}\)] = [4]
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (2, 5, 9)>

Node 5:
- Form 3-stars: [\({3 \choose 3}\)] = [1]
- Unique 3-stars: <5, (0, 3, 4)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars, we have a total of [8 + 8 + 4 + 1] = [21].
