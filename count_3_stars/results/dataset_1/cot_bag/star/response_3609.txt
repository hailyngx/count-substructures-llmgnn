Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 7, 9
- Node 2: 0
- Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 7, 9
- Node 4: 0, 3
- Node 5: 0, 9
- Node 6: 0, 3
- Node 7: 0, 1, 3
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

Let's calculate the 3-stars in the graph:

- For Node 0, there are 7 choose 3 = 35 3-stars.
- For Node 3, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
- For Node 9, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [35 + 10 + 1] = [46].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (3, 4, 6)>
