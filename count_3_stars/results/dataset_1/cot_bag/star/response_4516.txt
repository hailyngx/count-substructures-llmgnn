Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Total number of 3-stars = [5]

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (1, 4, 7)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<3, (0, 2, 9)>
<4, (0, 7, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
