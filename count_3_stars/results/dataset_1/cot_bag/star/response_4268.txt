Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Node 0 has 4 neighbors: 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 2 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, 9
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 3
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 4, 5
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 7, 8

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding them up, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [8], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (5, 7, 8)>
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 2, 3)>
<7, (0, 4, 5)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
