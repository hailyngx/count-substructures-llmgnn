Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0, it has neighbors 6 and 8. Thus, it forms 1 3-star. 
For node 1, it has neighbors 2 and 5. Thus, it forms 1 3-star. 
For node 2, it has neighbors 1, 3, 4, and 7. Thus, it forms 4 3-stars.
For node 3, it has neighbors 2 and 7. Thus, it forms 1 3-star. 
For node 4, it only has neighbor 2, so it doesn't form any 3-star. 
For node 5, it has neighbors 1, 7, and 8. Thus, it forms 1 3-star. 
For node 6, it only has neighbor 0, so it doesn't form any 3-star. 
For node 7, it has neighbors 2, 3, 5, 8, and 9. Thus, it forms 1 3-stars.
For node 8, it has neighbors 0, 5, and 7. Thus, it forms 1 3-star. 
For node 9, it only has neighbor 7, so it doesn't form any 3-star. 

In total, there are 9 3-stars. 

So the final answer is [9] and the unique 3-stars found are <0, (6, 8)>, <1, (2, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 4)>, <3, (2, 7)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (0, 5, 7)>.
