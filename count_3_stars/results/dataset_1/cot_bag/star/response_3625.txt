Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 5 nodes that have three or more neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>

- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>

- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
  <4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
  <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 4 + 4 + 10] = 22.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>,
<3, (1, 2, 5)>, <3, (1, 5, 9)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (1, 2, 7)>,
<4, (0, 1, 5)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (0, 1, 7)>, <4, (1, 5, 7)>,
<5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 8)>, <5, (3, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 8)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 8, 9)>, <5, (7, 8, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 8, 9)>.
