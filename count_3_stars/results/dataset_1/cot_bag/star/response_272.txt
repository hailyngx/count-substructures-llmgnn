Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 0) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 4, 5, 7, and 6. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 also has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up, the total number of 3-stars is \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 26 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [26].

Next, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 3, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<7, (0, 5, 6)>
