Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 7.
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 8.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 2, 3, 6.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars formed by each of these nodes:

- Node 2 can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 6 can form 1 3-star.
- Node 8 can form 1 3-star.

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23 \).

Therefore, putting the final number inside brackets [] gives us [23], and the unique 3-stars are:

<2, (0, 7, 9)>
<2, (5, 7, 9)>
<2, (6, 7, 9)>
<2, (0, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 9)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 7, 8)>
<2, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (0, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 7)>
<2, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (0, 5, 6)>
<2, (0, 6, 7)>
