Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 7, and 8. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 0 as the center.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars with node 4 as the center.
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors, so there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars with node 7 as the center.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star with node 8 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is \( 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 20 \).
Therefore, the answer is [20].

The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (7, 5, 8)>
<1, (7, 5, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (1, 5, 8)>
<7, (1, 5, 9)>
<7, (3, 5, 6)>
