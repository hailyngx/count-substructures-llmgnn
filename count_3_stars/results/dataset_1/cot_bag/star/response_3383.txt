Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 9. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- <0, (2, 4, 8)>
- <0, (2, 4, 9)>
- <0, (4, 8, 9)>
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Node 2: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- <4, (0, 2, 3)>
- <4, (0, 2, 5)>
- <4, (0, 3, 8)>
- <4, (0, 5, 7)>
- <4, (0, 7, 8)>
- <4, (2, 3, 8)>
- <4, (2, 5, 7)>
- <4, (2, 6, 7)>
- <4, (3, 5, 7)>
- <4, (5, 7, 8)>

Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is 14. Therefore, the answer is [14].
