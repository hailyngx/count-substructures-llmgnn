Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 3) (9, 0) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are listed as follows:

- Node 0: 6, 9
- Node 2: 3, 6
- Node 3: 2, 4, 7, 8
- Node 4: 3, 6, 9
- Node 5: 7
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 3
- Node 9: 0, 4

Now let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, which are nodes 3, 4, 6, and 9.
For node 3, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 6, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star.
For node 9, there are \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars (since it has less than 3 neighbors).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.
Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [6].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<3, (2, 4, 7)>
<4, (3, 6, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<3, (4, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 9, 6)>
<3, (2, 7, 8)>
