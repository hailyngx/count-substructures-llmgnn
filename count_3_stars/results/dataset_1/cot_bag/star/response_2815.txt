Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are listed below to ease the visualization of the graph:

Node 0: 2, 3, 4
Node 1: 3, 4, 5
Node 2: 0, 3, 4, 5, 6
Node 3: 0, 1, 2
Node 4: 0, 1, 2, 7, 8
Node 5: 1, 2, 7
Node 6: 2, 7, 8
Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
Node 8: 4, 6, 7, 9
Node 9: 7, 8

Now we'll calculate the number of 3-stars around each node:

Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 1: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 3: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 4: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 5: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 6: [inom{2}{3}] = 0
Node 7: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
Node 8: [inom{3}{3}] = 1
Node 9: [inom{2}{3}] = 0

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 10 + 0 + 0 + 10 + 1 + 0 = 24

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars formed in the given graph is [24].
