Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The central nodes that have 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

The total number of 3-stars is \(10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 44\).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [44].

Let's list the unique 3-stars found in the graph now:

<0, (2, 4, 5)>
<0, (2, 4, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (0, 8, 9)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
<7, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (0, 5, 9)>
