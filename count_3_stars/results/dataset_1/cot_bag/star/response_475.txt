Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are listed as follows:  

Node 0: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7  
Node 1: 0, 4, 5, 7, 8  
Node 2: 0, 6, 7, 9  
Node 3: 0, 6, 7, 9  
Node 4: 0, 1, 8  
Node 5: 1, 8  
Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 9  
Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6  
Node 8: 1, 4, 5  
Node 9: 2, 3, 6  

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph.  

For Node 0, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.  
For Node 1, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.  
For Node 2, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.  
For Node 3, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.  
For Node 4, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.  
For Node 6, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.  
For Node 7, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.  

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 43

Therefore, the final number of 3-stars is [43].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:  
<0, (1, 4, 7)>  
<1, (0, 4, 7)>  
<2, (6, 7, 9)>  
<3, (6, 7, 9)>  
<4, (0, 1, 8)>  
<6, (2, 3, 7)>  
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
