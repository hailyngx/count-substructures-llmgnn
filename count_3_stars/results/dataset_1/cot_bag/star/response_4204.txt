Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
Let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors:
- Node 0 (neighbors: 4, 6, 7)
- Node 1 (neighbors: 4, 7, 8)
- Node 4 (neighbors: 0, 1, 6)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 0, 2, 4)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 0, 1, 9)
- Node 8 (neighbors: 1, 5, 6)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

So, there are 4 3-stars in this graph. 

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4].
