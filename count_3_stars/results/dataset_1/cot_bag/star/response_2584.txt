Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors (2, 5, 8)
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 7)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 6)
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 4, 6, 7)
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors (4, 5, 8, 9)
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 5, 8)
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors (0, 1, 6, 7)
- Node 9 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6)

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
- From Node 0: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- From Node 1: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- From Node 2: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- From Node 4: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- From Node 5: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- From Node 6: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- From Node 7: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- From Node 8: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

Summing these up: 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 35

Therefore, there are a total of [35] 3-stars in this graph.

Unique 3-stars:
1. <0, (2, 5, 8)>
2. <1, (2, 5, 8)>
3. <1, (2, 5, 9)>
4. <1, (5, 6, 9)>
5. <1, (5, 7, 9)>
6. <2, (0, 1, 4)>
7. <2, (0, 1, 7)>
8. <2, (1, 4, 7)>
9. <4, (2, 5, 6)>
10. <4, (3, 5, 7)>
11. <5, (0, 4, 6)>
12. <5, (1, 4, 6)>
13. <5, (4, 6, 7)>
14. <5, (4, 7, 9)>
15. <5, (6, 7, 9)>
