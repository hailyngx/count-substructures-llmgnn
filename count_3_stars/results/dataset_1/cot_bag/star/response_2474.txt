Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9.

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph.
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

For each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars they are part of:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <1, (0, 2, 3)>, <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 3, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (4, 5, 6)>, <1, (0, 2, 5)>, <1, (2, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 6, 5)>, <2, (3, 6, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star. <3, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 4 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 5 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so it cannot form a 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 1 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 16.  
So, the final answer is [16].
