Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. 

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, there are three neighbors: 3, 6, 3. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <0, (3, 6, 3)>

For node 1, there are three neighbors: 5, 6, 8. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <1, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 2, there are three neighbors: 5, 6, 8. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <2, (5, 6, 8)>

For node 3, there are three neighbors: 0, 5, 7. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <3, (0, 5, 7)>

For node 4, there are three neighbors: 5, 6, 7. So, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <4, (5, 6, 7)>

For node 5, there are six neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9. So, there are \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars. <5, (1, 2, 3)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 7)>, <5, (1, 3, 4)>, <5, (1, 3, 7)>, <5, (1, 4, 7)>, <5, (2, 3, 4)>, <5, (2, 3, 7)>, <5, (2, 4, 7)>, <5, (3, 4, 7)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 3, 9)>, <5, (1, 4, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <5, (2, 4, 9)>, <5, (3, 4, 9)>, <5, (1, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (3, 7, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>

For node 6, there are five neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <6, (0, 1, 2)>, <6, (0, 1, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (0, 2, 8)>, <6, (1, 2, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 8)>, <6, (2, 4, 8)>

For node 7, there are five neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 8, 9. So, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars. <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 8)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 8)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 8, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 8)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 8, 9)>, <7, (5, 8, 9)>

For node 8, there are four neighbors: 1, 2, 6, 7. So, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 6, 7)>, <8, (2, 6, 7)>

For node 9, there are two neighbors: 5, 7. Since less than 3 neighbors, there are 0 3-stars.

Summing up all the cases, we have a total of [48] 3-stars in the graph.
