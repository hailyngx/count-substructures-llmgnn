Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 8, 9  
Node 1: 0  
Node 2: 3, 9  
Node 3: 2, 4  
Node 4: 0, 3, 6, 7  
Node 5: 0, 6, 7, 8  
Node 6: 4, 5, 7, 8  
Node 7: 4, 5, 6, 8, 9  
Node 8: 0, 5, 6, 7, 9  
Node 9: 0, 2, 7, 8  

Calculating the number of 3-stars based on the nodes with 3 or more neighbors:

Node 0 forms 4 3-stars  
Node 2 forms 3 3-stars  
Node 4 forms 4 3-stars  
Node 5 forms 4 3-stars  
Node 6 forms 4 3-stars  
Node 7 forms 4 3-stars  
Node 8 forms 4 3-stars  
Node 9 forms 3 3-stars  

Summing the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3 = 30

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [30].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<0, 4, 6, 8>  
<0, 4, 7, 8>  
<0, 5, 6, 8>  
<0, 5, 7, 8>  
<2, 3, 9>  
<4, 0, 3>  
<4, 6, 5>  
<4, 6, 7>  
<4, 7, 5>  
<4, 7, 6>  
<5, 0, 6>
