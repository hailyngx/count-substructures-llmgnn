Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes that have three or more neighbors are: 0, 6, 7, and 4. 

For node 0:
- Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 6:
- Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 9)>

For node 7:
- Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (0, 4, 6)>

For node 4:
- Number of 3-stars formed: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <4, (1, 5, 7)>

Putting it all together:
Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 1 + 1 = 16

Therefore, the answer is [16].
