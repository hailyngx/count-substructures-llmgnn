Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 38 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
There are two nodes which have three or more neighbors: nodes 0 and 4. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8. 
- Number of ways to choose 3 out of 5 neighbors: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- So, there are 10 3-stars with node 0 as the center.

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 6, and 8. 
- Number of ways to choose 3 out of 4 neighbors: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- So, there are 4 3-stars with node 4 as the center.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is the sum of 3-stars with node 0 and node 4 as the center:
Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from node 0) + 4 (from node 4) = 14 

Thus, the final answer is: [14]
The unique 3-stars in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>
<0, (1, 2, 7)>
<0, (1, 2, 8)>
<0, (1, 3, 7)>
<0, (1, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 7)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
