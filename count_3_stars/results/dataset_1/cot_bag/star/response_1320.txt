Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes in this graph that have three or more neighbors and are capable of forming 3-stars. These nodes are 1, 3, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars each node can form:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it can form only one 3-star.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can also form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is: \[ [4 + 1 + 4] = 9 \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- <1, (3, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 6, 8)>
- <3, (1, 4, 9)>
- <3, (1, 9, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 6)>
- <9, (2, 6, 8)>
- <9, (3, 6, 8)>
