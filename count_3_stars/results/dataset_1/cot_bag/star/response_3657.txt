Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 8) 

Response:
To start, let's find the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors
- Node 2 has 6 neighbors
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we get a total of 1 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 4 = 45 3-stars. 

Therefore, the final answer is [45].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (2, 6, 9)>
<2, (0, 1, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 5, 6)>
<4, (3, 5, 6)>
<4, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 2, 4)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 8)>
<6, (2, 5, 8)>
<8, (2, 4, 7)>
<8, (4, 5, 8)>
<8, (5, 7, 9)>
