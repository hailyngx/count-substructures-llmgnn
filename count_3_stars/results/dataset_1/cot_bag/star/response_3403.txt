Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 7) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the given graph with its nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: 
- 0: {4, 5}
- 1: {4, 6}
- 2: {5, 8}
- 3: {6}
- 4: {0, 1, 6}
- 5: {0, 2}
- 6: {1, 3, 4, 9}
- 7: {8}
- 8: {2, 7}
- 9: {6}

Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 4: <4, (0, 1, 6)> (1 unique 3-star)
- Node 6: <6, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (4, 3, 9)> (2 unique 3-stars)

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [3].
