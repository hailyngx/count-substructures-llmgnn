Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 6 nodes with 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9.  
For node 0:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <0, (1, 5, 6)>, <0, (2, 5, 6)>, <0, (5, 1, 6)>, <0, (5, 1, 2)>

For node 1:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars: <1, (0, 5, 6)>, <1, (2, 5, 6)>, <1, (5, 0, 6)>, <1, (5, 0, 2)>, <1, (5, 6, 9)>, <1, (5, 9, 2)>, <1, (5, 9, 7)>, <1, (6, 0, 5)>, <1, (6, 5, 2)>, <1, (6, 9, 5)>

For node 2:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (5, 0, 9)>, <2, (5, 1, 9)>

For node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- 3-stars: <5, (0, 1, 6)>, <5, (0, 2, 6)>, <5, (0, 6, 9)>, <5, (0, 6, 1)>, <5, (0, 6, 2)>, <5, (1, 0, 6)>, <5, (1, 6, 9)>, <5, (1, 6, 2)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <5, (2, 0, 6)>, <5, (2, 6, 9)>, <5, (2, 6, 1)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <5, (6, 0, 9)>, <5, (6, 0, 1)> <5, (6, 0, 2)>, <5, (6, 1, 2)>, <5, (6, 1, 9)>, <5, (6, 2, 9)>, <5, (6, 2, 7)>

For node 6:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- 3-stars: <6, (0, 1, 5)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (1, 0, 5)>, <6, (5, 0, 9)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- 3-stars: <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (2, 5, 6)>, <9, (5, 1, 6)>, <9, (5, 1, 2)>, <9, (5, 6, 7)>, <9, (5, 6, 0)>, <9, (5, 2, 0)>, <9, (6, 1, 5)>, <9, (6, 5, 0)>, <9, (6, 5, 2)>

Total number of 3-stars: \(4 + 10 + 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 52\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [52].
