Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will examine each node to see if it forms a 3-star. 

Node 0: (0, 2), (0, 8) - Does not form any 3-star.

Node 1: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8) - Forms one 3-star: <1, (5, 6, 7)>.

Node 2: (2, 0), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 8) - Does not form any 3-star.

Node 3: (3, 9) - Does not form any 3-star.

Node 4: (4, 2), (4, 5), (4, 7), (4, 8) - Forms one 3-star: <4, (2, 5, 7)>.

Node 5: (5, 1), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7) - Forms one 3-star: <5, (1, 6, 7)>.

Node 6: (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8) - Forms two 3-stars: <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>.

Node 7: (7, 1), (7, 4), (7, 5) - Does not form any 3-star.

Node 8: (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 6), (8, 9) - Forms four 3-stars: <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>.

Node 9: (9, 3), (9, 8) - Forms one 3-star: <9, (3, 8, 4)>.

Total number of 3-stars = [1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1] = [9].

Unique 3-stars found: <1, (5, 6, 7)>, <4, (2, 5, 7)>, <5, (1, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 4, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (4, 6, 9)>.
