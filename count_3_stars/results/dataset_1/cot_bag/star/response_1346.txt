Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 7.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 6.
- Node 3 is connected to node 0.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 6, 7, and 9.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 4.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1, 4, 8, and 9.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 7, and 8.

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.
- The total number of 3-stars is \( 20 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 35 \).

Therefore, there are [35] 3-stars in the graph. The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 8)>
<0, (4, 7, 9)>
<1, (0, 5, 7)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 2)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<8, (0, 7, 9)>
