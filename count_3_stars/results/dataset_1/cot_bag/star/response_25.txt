Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 8) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their corresponding neighbors are:
- Node 0: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 1: {3, 5}
- Node 2: {6, 8, 9}
- Node 3: {1, 6}
- Node 4: {8}
- Node 5: {1}
- Node 6: {0, 2, 3, 8}
- Node 8: {0, 2, 4, 6, 9}
- Node 9: {0, 2, 8}

Now we'll find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 2: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
For node 6: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
For node 8: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
For node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 17

Hence, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [17].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 2, 8)>
<8, (0, 2, 6)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<8, (0, 6, 9)>
<8, (2, 4, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<9, (0, 2, 8)>
