Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their connections are given below:

- Node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 4.
- Node 1 connects to nodes 0, 2, and 3.
- Node 2 connects to nodes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 3 connects to nodes 1, 2, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 connects to nodes 0, 2, 5, 7, and 8.
- Node 5 connects to nodes 2, 4, and 6.
- Node 6 connects to nodes 3 and 5.
- Node 7 connects to nodes 2 and 4.
- Node 8 connects to nodes 2, 3, and 4.

Let's go through each node to find the number of 3-stars they are a part of:
1. Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
2. Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
3. Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
4. Node 5: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 35

Thus, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [35], and the unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 4)>, <2, (3, 8, 4)>, <2, (4, 7, 5)>
