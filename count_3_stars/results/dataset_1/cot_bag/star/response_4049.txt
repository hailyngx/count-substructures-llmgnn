Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (4, 1) (4, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, let's first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 

Node 1 has 8 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 1, 1 
Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 7, 2
Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 9, 1
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 1
Node 7 has 4 neighbors: 2, 6, 9, 2
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 1, 1

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:

Node 1: \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \)
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars: \( [56 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 10] = [76] \)

The unique 3-stars are: 
<1, 0, 2, 4>
<1, 0, 2, 6>
<1, 0, 2, 8>
<1, 0, 2, 9>
<1, 0, 4, 6>
<1, 0, 4, 8>
<1, 0, 4, 9>
<1, 0, 6, 8>
<1, 0, 6, 9>
<1, 0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 4, 6>
<1, 2, 4, 9>
<1, 2, 6, 8>
<1, 2, 6, 9>
<1, 2, 8, 9>
<1, 4, 6, 9>
<1, 6, 8, 9>
<2, 0, 1, 7>
<2, 0, 7, 6>
<2, 1, 7, 9>
<7, 2, 6, 9>

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph with 10 nodes and 22 edges is [76].
