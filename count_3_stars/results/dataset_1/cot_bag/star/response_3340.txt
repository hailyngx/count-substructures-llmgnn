Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
From the given edge list, the nodes with three or more neighbors are: 
- Node 0 with neighbors 1 and 3
- Node 1 with neighbors 0, 4, and 7
- Node 3 with neighbors 0, 2, 5, 6, and 7
- Node 4 with neighbors 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 6 with neighbors 3, 4, 7, and 8
- Node 8 with neighbors 3, 4, 5, and 6

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: [0 3-stars]
- Node 1: [1 3-star]
- Node 3: [4 3-stars]
- Node 4: [5 3-stars]
- Node 6: [4 3-stars]
- Node 8: [3 3-stars]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [0 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 3] = 17.

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <1, (0, 3, 7)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <3, (0, 3, 7)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 6, 8)>
- <4, (1, 2, 6)>
- <4, (1, 4, 9)>
- <4, (2, 4, 6)>
- <4, (2, 4, 8)>
- <6, (3, 4, 7)>
- <6, (3, 6, 8)>
- <6, (4, 6, 8)>
- <6, (4, 6, 7)>
- <8, (3, 4, 6)>
- <8, (3, 4, 8)>
- <8, (3, 5, 8)>
- <8, (4, 6, 8)>
