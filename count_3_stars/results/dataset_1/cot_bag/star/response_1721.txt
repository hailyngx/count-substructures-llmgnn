Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 7, 8
- Node 1: 2, 9
- Node 2: 1, 7
- Node 3: 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 5: 3, 4, 9
- Node 6: 3, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 2, 4, 6
- Node 8: 0, 3
- Node 9: 1, 3, 5

We need to find the total number of 3-stars in this graph. Let's calculate this:

- For Node 0: Total 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- For Node 3: Total 3-stars = \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- For Node 4: Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 7: Total 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- For Node 9: Total 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)

Adding up all the 3-stars, we get a total of \( 1 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 30 \).

Therefore, there are [30] 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (3, 7, 8)>
- <3, (0, 4, 5)>
- <3, (0, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 5, 9)>
- <3, (4, 6, 7)>
- <3, (5, 4, 9)>
- <4, (3, 5, 6)>
- <4, (5, 3, 9)>
- <4, (6, 3, 7)>
- <7, (0, 2, 4)>
