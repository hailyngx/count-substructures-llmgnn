Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 3) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) 

Response:
Let's first construct the graph based on the given information:

The graph has 10 nodes and the following edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 7 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 5, 7, 8, and 9.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5, 6, and 8.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 5 and 7.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4.
- Node 6 is connected to node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 4.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1, 3, and 9.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 1, and 8.

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph:

For node 1: It has 4 neighbors (nodes 5, 7, 8, 9), so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

For node 3: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 5, 6, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 5: It also has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 4), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 7: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 4), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 8: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 1, 3, 9), so it can form 1 3-star.

For node 9: It has 3 neighbors (nodes 0, 1, 8), so it can form 1 3-star.

Summing up all the 3-stars we found, we have a total of \( 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (7, 8, 9)>
- <3, (5, 6, 8)>
- <5, (1, 3, 4)>
- <7, (0, 1, 4)>
- <8, (1, 3, 9)>
- <9, (0, 1, 8)>
- <9, (1, 8, 9)>
