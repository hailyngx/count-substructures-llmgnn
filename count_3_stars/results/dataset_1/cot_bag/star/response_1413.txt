Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 3) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:  
Nodes with 3 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9  
Nodes with 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 8, 9  

Now, we'll find the total number of 3-stars using the combinatorial calculation mentioned earlier.  

For nodes with 3 neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9): 
\[ \text{Number of 3-stars} = \binom{3}{3} + \binom{4}{3} = 1 + 4 = 5 \]  

So, we have discovered 5 3-stars with nodes having 3 or 4 neighbors.

Putting this final count inside brackets [], we get: [5].

Next, we'll list the unique 3-stars: 
<0, (3, 5, 8)>  
<1, (2, 4, 9)>  
<2, (1, 3, 8)>  
<3, (0, 2, 9)>  
<8, (0, 1, 9)>
