Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
There are 14 nodes with degree 2 and 4 nodes with degree 4. We'll focus on the nodes with degree 4 to identify the 3-stars in the graph.

For each node with degree 4, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed using that node as the center:
Node 1:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<1, (0, 4, 5)>

Node 2:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<2, (4, 9, -)>

Node 4:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<4, (1, 2, 7)>

Node 5:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<5, (0, 1, 9)>

Node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
<9, (0, 2, 3)>

So, there are 5 unique 3-stars in the given graph.
Putting this final count inside brackets gives us the total number of 3-stars as [5].
