Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 6) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (9, 4) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

- Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 6, and 7
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors: 1, 6, and 9
- Node 6 has 7 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 0

Next, we calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes:

- Node 1 can form 1 3-star
- Node 4 can form 1 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Since we have found 1 + 1 + 35 = 37 3-star configurations in total, we put this number inside brackets:

\[ [37] \]

Lastly, we list the unique 3-stars found:

\[ <1, (0, 4, 6)>, <4, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (1, 2, 3)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 7)>, <6, (1, 3, 4)>, <6, (1, 3, 5)>, <6, (1, 3, 7)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <6, (1, 5, 7)>, <6, (2, 3, 4)>, <6, (2, 3, 5)>, <6, (2, 3, 7)>, <6, (2, 4, 5)>, <6, (2, 4, 7)>, <6, (2, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)> \]
