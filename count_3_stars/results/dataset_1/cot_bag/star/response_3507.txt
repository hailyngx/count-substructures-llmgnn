Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:

- Node 0: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Node 1: 0, 4, 7
- Node 2: 3, 7, 8
- Node 3: 2, 5
- Node 4: 0, 1, 5, 6
- Node 5: 0, 3, 4
- Node 6: 0, 4, 7
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 6
- Node 8: 2, 9
- Node 9: 8

Node 0, 4, and 7 have three or more neighbors. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For Node 0: inom{5}{3} = 10
- For Node 4: inom{4}{3} = 4
- For Node 7: inom{4}{3} = 4

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 4 + 4 = 18

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [18].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

- <0, (1, 5, 6)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (4, 5, 6)>
- <0, (4, 6, 7)>
- <0, (5, 6, 7)>
