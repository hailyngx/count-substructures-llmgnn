Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 7) (4, 0) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given information:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,9), (2,6), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (4,0), (4,9), (5,0), (5,1), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,3), (8,2), (8,9), (9,1), (9,2), (9,4), (9,8)

Next, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars they form:

Node 0: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7) -> 4 neighbors -> Total 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4
Node 2: (2,6), (2,8), (2,9) -> 3 neighbors -> Total 3-stars = C(3,3) = 1
Node 9: (9,1), (9,2), (9,4), (9,8) -> 4 neighbors -> Total 3-stars = C(4,3) = 4

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 = 9

Therefore, the number of 3-stars in the given graph is [9].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 5, 6)>
<0, (4, 5, 7)>
<0, (4, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<2, (6, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 8)>
<9, (1, 2, 4)>
<9, (1, 2, 8)>
<9, (4, 8, 9)>
