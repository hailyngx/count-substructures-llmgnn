Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: nodes 0, 4, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

For node 4:
- Node 4 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 9
- Number of 3-stars with node 4 as the center: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 3, 4, 8
- Number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 10 + 20 + 4 = 34

So, the final answer is [34] and the unique 3-stars are:
<0, (1, 4, 8)>
<0, (1, 4, 6)>
<0, (1, 4, 3)>
<0, (1, 4, 9)>
<0, (3, 4, 6)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<0, (3, 4, 9)>
<0, (4, 6, 8)>
<0, (4, 6, 9)>
<0, (4, 8, 9)>
<4, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 6, 1)>
<4, (0, 6, 3)>
<4, (0, 6, 9)>
<4, (1, 6, 3)>
<4, (1, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 6, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 6)>
<4, (0, 1, 8)>

<9, (3, 4, 8)>
<9, (3, 4, 6)>
<9, (0, 4, 8)>
<9, (0, 4, 6)>
