Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's represent the graph visually:

```
    0 --- 6
    |     |
    6 --- 1 --- 7 --- 9
    |  /  |     |      
    3 --- 2 --- 8
        /
       4 --- 5
```

From the graph, we can see that each of the nodes 1, 2, 6, and 7 has three or more neighbors and can potentially form 3-stars. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is:

\[ [4 + 4 + 10 + 1] = [19] \]

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:

<1, (0, 6, 3)>
<1, (2, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 2, 4)>
<2, (1, 6, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<6, (1, 2, 7)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (2, 4, 5)>
<6, (3, 5, 7)>
<6, (3, 6, 7)>
<6, (6, 7, 9)>
<6, (6, 2, 4)>
<6, (7, 2, 1)>
<7, (1, 6, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
<7, (6, 2, 8)>
