Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, let's identify the nodes with 3 or more neighbors to find the 3-stars:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 9

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 20 = 43

So, the final answer is [43].
The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (1, 5, 7)>, <0, (1, 5, 9)>, <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <0, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (0, 5, 9)>, <4, (0, 5, 7)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <5, (0, 1, 9)>, <5, (0, 4, 7)>, <5, (0, 4, 9)>, <5, (4, 7, 9)>, <7, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (0, 1, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 5, 6)>, <9, (4, 5, 6)>.
