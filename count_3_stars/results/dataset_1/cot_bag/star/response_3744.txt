Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 4) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors, as only those nodes can potentially form 3-stars.

Node 4 has 5 neighbors: {1, 2, 3, 6, 8}
Node 6 has 4 neighbors: {0, 3, 4, 9}
Node 9 has 4 neighbors: {1, 6, 7}
Node 0 has 2 neighbors: {6, 7}
Node 1 has 2 neighbors: {4, 9}
Node 3 has 2 neighbors: {4, 5}
Node 7 has 2 neighbors: {0, 9}

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 4: \( inom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 9: \( inom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of 10 + 4 + 4 = 18 3-stars. 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [18].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<4, (1, 2, 3)>
<4, (1, 2, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 6)>
<4, (2, 3, 6)>
<4, (1, 3, 8)>
<6, (0, 3, 4)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
<6, (3, 4, 9)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 6, 7)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the given graph.
