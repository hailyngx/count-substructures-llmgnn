Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's sketch the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (2, 3), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 2), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 6), (5, 8), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6)

Now, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:
- Node 2 has neighbors 3, 6, 7 (3 neighbors)
- Node 3 has neighbors 2, 7, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 6, 8 (3 neighbors)
- Node 6 has neighbors 2, 5, 8, 9 (4 neighbors)
- Node 7 has neighbors 2, 3, 4 (3 neighbors)
- Node 8 has neighbors 3, 4, 5, 6 (4 neighbors)

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4] = 12 \).

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<2, (3, 6, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 8)>, <5, (6, 0, 8)>, <6, (2, 5, 8)>, <8, (3, 4, 6)>, <8, (3, 4, 5)>.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
