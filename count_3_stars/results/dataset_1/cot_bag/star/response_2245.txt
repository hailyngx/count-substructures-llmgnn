Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with at least 3 neighbors are: 0, 3, 7, 9.

For node 0:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <0, (2, 3, 5)>, <0, (2, 3, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (3, 5, 8)>

For node 3:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <3, (0, 1, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 6, 8)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (6, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 1, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 8, 9)>, <3, (0, 8, 9)>

For node 7:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>

For node 9:
- Number of 3-stars = \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (1, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>, <9, (1, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 4, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>, <9, (4, 5, 7)>, <9, (1, 5, 7)>

Adding up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28
Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [28].
