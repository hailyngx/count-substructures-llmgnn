Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 8, 9
- Node 1: 0, 2, 4, 8, 9
- Node 2: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
- Node 3: 2, 4
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 9
- Node 5: 0
- Node 6: 2, 7
- Node 7: 6, 9
- Node 8: 0, 1, 2, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 4, 7, 8

Now we'll find 3-stars that can be formed:
- Node 0: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 1: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 2: [inom{5}{3}] = 10
- Node 4: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 8: [inom{4}{3}] = 4
- Node 9: [inom{5}{3}] = 10

Adding these up, we have 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 42 3-stars.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [42].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<0, 1, 8, 9>
<1, 0, 8, 9>
<1, 2, 4, 9>
<1, 9, 8, 0>
<2, 1, 4, 9>
<2, 8, 1, 9>
<4, 1, 2, 9>
<4, 9, 1, 2>
<8, 0, 1, 9>
<8, 1, 2, 9>
