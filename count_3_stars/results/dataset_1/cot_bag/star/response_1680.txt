Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 6) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then for each of these nodes, we will calculate the number of 3-stars centered at that node.

The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9.

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so it forms 1 3-star.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors, so it does not form any 3-star.

Adding up the 3-stars formed at each eligible node, we get a total of 10 3-stars: [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 8)>
<1, (4, 7, 9)>
<3, (1, 4, 9)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 7, 8)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
