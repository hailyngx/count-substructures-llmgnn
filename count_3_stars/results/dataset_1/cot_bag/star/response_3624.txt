Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are as follows: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Let's determine the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 2, 7, 9 
	- There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (2, 7, 9)>

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 8
	- There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center:
	    <1, (3, 5, 6)>, <1, (3, 5, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (5, 6, 8)>

Node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 5, 7, 8
	- There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 2 as the center:
	    <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 7)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, 
	    <2, (0, 7, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 7)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 7, 8)>, <2, (5, 7, 8)>

Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9
	- There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 3 as the center: <3, (1, 2, 9)>

Node 5 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 8, 9
	- There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 5 as the center:
	    <5, (1, 2, 8)>, <5, (1, 2, 9)>, <5, (1, 8, 9)>, <5, (2, 8, 9)>

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 1, 7, 8
	- There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 6 as the center: <6, (1, 7, 8)>

Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 6
	- There are [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star with node 7 as the center: <7, (0, 2, 6)>

Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 5, 6, 9
	- There are [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars with node 8 as the center:
	    <8, (1, 2, 5)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (1, 5, 6)>, <8, (1, 5, 9)>, 
	    <8, (1, 6, 9)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 9)>, <8, (2, 6, 9)>, <8, (5, 6, 9)>

Node 9 has 4 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5
	- There are [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars with node 9 as the center:
	    <9, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (0, 3, 5)>, <9, (0, 4, 5)>, <9, (3, 4, 5)>

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4] = 36.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [36].
