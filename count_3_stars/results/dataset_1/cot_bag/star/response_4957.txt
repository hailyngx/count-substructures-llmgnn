Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 6) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
For each node with three or more neighbors, we will calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in. Let's list the nodes with their corresponding neighbors:

- Node 0: 3, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 3, 7, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 9
- Node 8: 0, 2, 3, 9
- Node 9: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Adding these up, we have a total of \( 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 38 \) 3-stars.

Therefore, the final answer is [38], and the unique 3-stars found are:
<0, (3, 8, 9)>
<8, (0, 2, 9)>
<9, (0, 1, 2)>
<9, (0, 6, 7)>
<9, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (6, 7, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 9)>
<0, (3, 7, 9)>
<9, (2, 6, 7)>
<9, (2, 7, 8)>
<9, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (5, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 1, 8)>
<1, (3, 7, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
<7, (1, 9, 8)>
<1, (7, 8, 9)>
<6, (0, 4, 9)>
