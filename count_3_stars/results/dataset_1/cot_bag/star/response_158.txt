Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
From the given edges, the nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:

Node 1: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
Node 2: 5, 7
Node 3: 9
Node 4: 6, 7
Node 5: 1, 2, 6
Node 6: 1, 4, 5, 7
Node 7: 1, 2, 4, 6
Node 8: 1
Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node having three or more neighbors:
1. For node 1, there are 5 choose 3 = 10 3-stars.
2. For node 5, there is 1 3-star.
3. For node 6, there are 3 choose 3 = 1 3-star.
4. For node 7, there are 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars.
5. For node 9, there is 1 3-star.

Total number of 3-stars = 10 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 17

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [17].

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (5, 6, 7)>
<1, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<1, (5, 7, 8)>
<1, (5, 7, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<1, (6, 7, 9)>
<1, (8, 9, 1)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (6, 1, 7)>
<6, (1, 5, 7)>
<7, (1, 5, 6)>
<7, (1, 6, 5)>
<8, (1, 5, 6)>
<9, (1, 5, 6)>
