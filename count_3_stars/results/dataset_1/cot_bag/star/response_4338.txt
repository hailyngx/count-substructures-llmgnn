Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 4, 5, 8, and 9. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Therefore, there are a total of \( 4 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 29 \) 3-stars in the given graph.

Putting this number inside brackets gives us [29].

And the unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (2, 4, 6)>
<0, (4, 1, 5)>
<0, (4, 1, 6)>
<0, (4, 1, 9)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
<5, (4, 8, 9)>
<8, (3, 5, 9)>
