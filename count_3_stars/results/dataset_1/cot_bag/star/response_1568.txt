Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors in the graph are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 9
- Node 1: 7, 8, 9
- Node 2: 5, 8
- Node 3: 0, 5
- Node 4: 8
- Node 5: 0, 2, 3
- Node 6: 0, 7
- Node 7: 1, 6, 8, 9
- Node 8: 1, 2, 4, 7
- Node 9: 0, 1, 7

Calculating the number of 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star.
- Node 7 forms 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms 4 3-stars.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [1 + 4 + 4] = [9].

Listing all the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (3, 5, 6)>
- <7, (1, 8, 9)>
- <7, (1, 6, 9)>
- <7, (1, 8, 6)>
- <7, (1, 8, 7)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 7, 9)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
