Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Node 1: 2, 5, 7
- Node 2: 1, 5, 9
- Node 3: 0, 4, 8, 9
- Node 4: 3, 5, 9
- Node 5: 0, 1, 2, 4
- Node 6: 0, 8
- Node 7: 0, 1, 8
- Node 8: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Node 9: 0, 2, 3, 4

Now let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 6 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 20 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, (5, 7, 9)>
<0, (6, 8, 9)>
<0, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 7)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<0, (7, 8, 5)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<8, (3, 0, 4)>
<8, (3, 0, 9)>
