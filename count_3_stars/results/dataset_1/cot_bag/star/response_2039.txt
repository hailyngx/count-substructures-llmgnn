Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 9) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 6) 

Response:
To identify the 3-stars in this graph, we first label the nodes based on the information provided.  
Here is the list of nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 7  
Node 1: 4, 6, 7  
Node 2: 3, 6, 7  
Node 3: 2, 5  
Node 4: 1, 9  
Node 5: 3  
Node 6: 1, 2, 8, 9  
Node 7: 0, 1, 2  
Node 8: 6  
Node 9: 4, 6  

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

Node 0: <0, (7, 1, 7)> = 1  
Node 1: <1, (4, 1, 7)> = 1  
Node 1: <1, (6, 1, 7)> = 1  
Node 1: <1, (7, 1, 7)> = 1  
Node 2: <2, (3, 2, 7)> = 1  
Node 2: <2, (6, 2, 7)> = 1  
Node 2: <2, (7, 2, 7)> = 1  
Node 3: <3, (2, 3, 5)> = 1  
Node 4: <4, (1, 4, 9)> = 1  
Node 6: <6, (1, 6, 7)> = 1  
Node 6: <6, (2, 6, 7)> = 1  
Node 6: <6, (6, 1, 7)> = 1  
Node 6: <6, (6, 2, 7)> = 1  
Node 6: <6, (6, 8, 9)> = 1  
Node 6: <6, (6, 9, 4)> = 1  
Node 7: <7, (0, 7, 1)> = 1  
Node 7: <7, (1, 7, 2)> = 1  
Node 7: <7, (2, 7, 3)> = 1  
Node 9: <9, (4, 9, 6)> = 1  
Node 9: <9, (6, 9, 4)> = 1  

Adding up all these unique 3-stars, we have a total of [20] 3-stars in the graph.
