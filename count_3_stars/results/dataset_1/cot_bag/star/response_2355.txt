Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are as follows:
0: 7
1: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8
2: 5
3: 1, 4, 5, 7, 9
4: 1, 3
5: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9
6: 1, 5, 9
7: 0, 3
8: 1
9: 3, 5, 6

Let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:
[4] - 1 3-star with node 1 as the center and nodes 4, 5, 6 as the leaves
[2] - 1 3-star with node 3 as the center and nodes 1, 4, 5 as the leaves

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [4 + 2] = [6].
The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (1, 4, 5)>
