Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are given below:
- Node 0: {3, 4, 9}
- Node 1: {4, 7, 8}
- Node 2: {3}
- Node 3: {0, 2, 4, 7, 8}
- Node 4: {0, 1, 3, 6, 8}
- Node 6: {4, 8}
- Node 7: {1, 3, 8, 9}
- Node 8: {1, 3, 4, 6, 7}
- Node 9: {0, 7}

Considering nodes with three or more neighbors, we can find the number of 3-stars formed by each node:
- Node 0 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 1 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star.
- Node 3 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.
- Node 7 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars.
- Node 8 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 36

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [36].
