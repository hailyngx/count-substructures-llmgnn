Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 20 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph and their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 1, 9
- Node 1: 0
- Node 2: 4, 6
- Node 3: 4, 7, 9
- Node 4: 2, 3, 6
- Node 5: 7, 8
- Node 6: 2, 4
- Node 7: 3, 5
- Node 8: 5
- Node 9: 0, 3

Now, let's identify the 3-stars formed in this graph:
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with 3 neighbors: <3, (4, 7, 9)>
- Node 4 forms two 3-stars with 3 neighbors each: <4, (2, 3, 6)> and <4, (3, 6, 2)>
- Node 5 forms a 3-star with 3 neighbors: <5, (7, 8, 5)>

There are a total of 4 unique 3-stars in this graph, so the final answer is [4].
