Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we will first list the nodes with their neighbors:

Node 0: 1, 3, 6
Node 1: 0, 2, 6, 8, 9
Node 2: 1, 3, 5
Node 3: 0, 2, 4, 5, 9
Node 4: 3, 6, 8
Node 5: 2, 3, 7
Node 6: 0, 1, 4
Node 7: 5, 8
Node 8: 1, 4, 7
Node 9: 1, 3

Now, let's determine the 3-stars:

Node 0: 
- No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 1: 
- 1 3-star: <1, (0, 6, 9)>

Node 2: 
- No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 3: 
- 1 3-star: <3, (0, 2, 9)>

Node 4: 
- No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 5: 
- No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 6: 
- 1 3-star: <6, (0, 1, 4)>

Node 7: 
- No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 8: 
- No 3-star can be formed since it has less than 3 neighbors.

Node 9: 
- 1 3-star: <9, (1, 3, 0)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [2]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (0, 6, 9)> and <9, (1, 3, 0)>.
