Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information provided, let's construct the graph with 10 nodes and 18 edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9}

Edges: {(0, 1), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 8), (1, 9), (3, 0), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 3), (4, 7), (4, 9), (7, 4), (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 8)}

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:

Nodes with 3 or more neighbors: {1, 3, 4, 8, 9}

Now, we'll calculate the total number of 3-stars using the formula \( \binom{n}{3} \) for each of these nodes:

For node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Adding up the total number of 3-stars:

1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17

So, there are 17 3-stars in total, which can be listed as follows:

[<1, (0, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 4, 8)>, <4, (3, 7, 9)>, <8, (1, 3, 9)>, <9, (1, 4, 8)>]
