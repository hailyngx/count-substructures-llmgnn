Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's create the graph with 10 nodes and the given edges:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 1, 5, 7, and 9
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0, 5, 7, and 8
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 9
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 6, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 5 and 7
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, and 6
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 1 and 3
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 5

Now, let's find the number of 3-stars:

- Node 2, 3, and 7 have 4 neighbors each, so for each of them, we have \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. So, we have a total of 12 3-stars.
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors, so \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 0, 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have fewer than 3 neighbors, so they do not form any 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 12 + 4 = 16 \).

Therefore, the final answer is [16], and the unique 3-stars are <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <3, (0, 2, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 7, 9)>, <5, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 3, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>.
