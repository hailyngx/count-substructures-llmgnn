Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 5) (1, 2) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 7) 

Response:
This graph can be visualized as follows:

```
      0 -- 2 -- 5
     /|    |    | \
    / |    |    |  \
   1  8    3    6  4
                 |  |
                 7  9
```

The nodes with three or more neighbors are nodes 0, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes.

- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 
   <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>, <0, (2, 5, 8)>

- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>

- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
   <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 0, 8)>, <5, (2, 0, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (2, 0, 8)>, <5, (2, 0, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>, <5, (0, 2, 8)>

- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
   <6, (1, 7, 8)>

- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
   <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>, <7, (4, 6, 8)>

- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
   <8, (2, 4, 5)>, <8, (2, 4, 6)>, <8, (2, 5, 4)>, <8, (2, 5, 6)>, <8, (2, 6, 4)>, <8, (2, 6, 5)>, <8, (4, 2, 5)>, <8, (4, 2, 6)>, <8, (4, 5, 2)>, <8, (4, 5, 6)>, <8, (4, 6, 2)>, <8, (4, 6, 5)>, <8, (5, 2, 4)>, <8, (5, 2, 6)>, <8, (5, 4, 2)>, <8, (5, 4, 6)>, <8, (5, 6, 2)>, <8, (5, 6, 4)>, <8, (6, 2, 4)>, <8, (6, 2, 5)>

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 10 + 1 + 4 + 20 = 49

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [49].
