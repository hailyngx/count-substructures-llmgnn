Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's list the degrees of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0: degree 3
- Node 1: degree 5
- Node 2: degree 2
- Node 3: degree 3
- Node 4: degree 2
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 3
- Node 8: degree 5
- Node 9: degree 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:

For node 0: No 3-stars can be formed as it has fewer than 3 neighbors.
For node 1: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
For node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star
For node 8: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars
For node 9: inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars

Summing up, we have a total of 10 + 1 + 10 + 10 = 31 3-stars. Therefore, the final answer is [31].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (0, 6, 7)>
<1, (2, 9, 3)>
<1, (6, 0, 7)>
<1, (8, 9, 3)>
<1, (9, 2, 3)>
<3, (7, 8, 9)>
<8, (1, 9, 3)>
<8, (4, 9, 3)>
<8, (7, 3, 9)>
<8, (9, 1, 3)>
<9, (1, 2, 3)>
<9, (4, 8, 3)>
<9, (8, 1, 3)>
<9, (2, 1, 3)>
<9, (3, 7, 8)>
