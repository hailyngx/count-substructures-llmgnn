Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the information about the graph, let's identify the nodes with at least three neighbors:

- Node 3 has neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 9
- Node 8 has neighbors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [10 + 20] = 30.

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <3, (0, 1, 2)>
- <3, (0, 1, 6)>
- <3, (0, 1, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 6)>
- <3, (0, 2, 9)>
- <3, (1, 2, 6)>
- <3, (1, 2, 9)>
- <3, (1, 6, 9)>
- <3, (2, 6, 9)>
- <8, (1, 2, 4)>
- <8, (1, 2, 5)>
- <8, (1, 2, 7)>
- <8, (1, 4, 5)>
- <8, (1, 4, 7)>
- <8, (1, 5, 7)>
- <8, (2, 4, 5)>
- <8, (2, 4, 7)>
- <8, (2, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 7)>
- <8, (4, 5, 9)>
- <8, (4, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 9)>
- <8, (5, 7, 6)>
- <8, (5, 9, 6)>
- <8, (7, 9, 6)>
- <8, (7, 9, 3)>
- <8, (7, 6, 3)>
- <8, (9, 6, 3)>
- <8, (9, 3, 2)>
