Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
Given the graph with 10 nodes and 26 edges, we first represent the nodes and their connections:  

- Node 0 is connected to node 8  
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 8  
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 3 and 5  
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 1, 2, 7, and 8  
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 7 and 8  
- Node 5 is connected to node 2  
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 8  
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 8  
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9  
- Node 9 is connected to node 8  

Now, let's determine the 3-stars in this graph:

- Node 1 forms a 3-star with nodes (3, 6, 8)  
- Node 3 forms a 3-star with nodes (1, 2, 8)  
- Node 8 forms 6 different 3-stars:  
  - (0, 1, 3)  
  - (1, 3, 6)  
  - (1, 3, 7)  
  - (1, 3, 8)  
  - (3, 4, 7)  
  - (3, 7, 8)  

Counting all the identified 3-stars, we have a total of [10].  
The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:  
<1, (3, 6, 8)>  
<3, (1, 2, 8)>  
<8, (0, 1, 3)>  
<8, (1, 3, 6)>  
<8, (1, 3, 7)>  
<8, (1, 3, 8)>  
<8, (3, 4, 7)>  
<8, (3, 7, 8)>
