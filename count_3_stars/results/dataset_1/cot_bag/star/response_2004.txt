Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9.

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 35 + 4 + 4 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [62].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 9)>
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<2, (1, 3, 6)>
<2, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (2, 4, 6)>
<3, (4, 5, 6)>
<3, (6, 8, 9)>
