Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 5) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes of the graph are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

Now, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors
- Node 5 has 6 neighbors
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Next, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- For node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up: \( 4 + 20 + 4 + 10 = 38 \)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [38].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, (2, 3, 6)>
- <0, (2, 6, 9)>
- <0, (3, 5, 7)>
- <0, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 6)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (1, 6, 9)>
- <5, (3, 4, 6)>
- <5, (3, 4, 8)>
- <5, (3, 6, 9)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <7, (0, 4, 9)>
- <7, (3, 4, 9)>
- <7, (4, 9, 8)>
- <9, (2, 4, 7)>
- <9, (2, 4, 8)>
- <9, (2, 5, 8)>
- <9, (4, 7, 8)>
- <9, (5, 7, 8)>
