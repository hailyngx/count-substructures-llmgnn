Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
Applying the construction rule for a 3-star graph, we observe that nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 have a degree of at least 3. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Node 9: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Adding these up, we get a total of 30 3-stars in this graph. 

Therefore, the final answer is [30]. The unique 3-stars are <1, (3, 4, 6)>, <1, (3, 4, 9)>, <1, (3, 8, 9)>, <1, (4, 8, 9)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <4, (1, 3, 9)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, and <9, (1, 4, 7)>.
