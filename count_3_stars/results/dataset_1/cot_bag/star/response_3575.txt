Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 8) (1, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 5) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors
- Node 9 has 5 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 2 can form \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Adding these up gives a total of 1 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 19 3-stars in the graph. 

Thus, the final answer is [19]. 

Unique 3-stars found in the graph: 
- <2, (3, 7, 9)>
- <3, (0, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 8, 9)>
- <3, (8, 9, 9)>
- <5, (1, 7, 9)>
- <5, (6, 7, 9)>
- <5, (7, 2, 9)>
- <5, (7, 9, 9)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 5)>
- <9, (3, 4, 5)>
- <9, (3, 5, 9)>
- <9, (4, 3, 5)>
- <9, (4, 5, 9)>
- <9, (5, 2, 3)>
- <9, (5, 2, 7)>
- <9, (5, 3, 4)>
- <9, (5, 4, 9)>
