Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 2, 6, 8, and 9.

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 6, 7, and 8.
- Total number of 3-stars with node 0 as the center: $\binom{3}{3} = 1$
- Unique 3-star with node 0 as the center: <0, (6, 7, 8)>

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 7, 8, and 9.
- Total number of 3-stars with node 2 as the center: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$
- Unique 3-stars with node 2 as the center: <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>

For node 6:
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors: 0, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
- Total number of 3-stars with node 6 as the center: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Unique 3-stars with node 6 as the center: <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>

For node 8:
- Node 8 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7.
- Total number of 3-stars with node 8 as the center: $\binom{5}{3} = 10$
- Unique 3-stars with node 8 as the center: <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>

For node 9:
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 2 and 3.
- Total number of 3-stars with node 9 as the center: $\binom{2}{3} = 0$

Adding up the total number of 3-stars from each node: 1 + 4 + 10 + 10 + 0 = 25

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25]. The unique 3-stars found are: <0, (6, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 7, 8)>, <2, (1, 8, 9)>, <2, (7, 8, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <6, (0, 3, 4)>, <6, (0, 3, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 7)>, <6, (4, 5, 7)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <8, (0, 1, 2)>, <8, (0, 1, 4)>, <8, (0, 1, 7)>, <8, (0, 2, 4)>, <8, (0, 2, 7)>, <8, (0, 4, 7)>, <8, (1, 2, 4)>, <8, (1, 2, 7)>, <8, (1, 4, 7)>, <8, (2, 4, 7)>.
