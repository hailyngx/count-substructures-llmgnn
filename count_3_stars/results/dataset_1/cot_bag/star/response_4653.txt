Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \(\binom{2}{3} = 0\) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 3: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 4: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 6: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 8: \(\binom{3}{3} = 1\)
- Node 9: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\)

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [10].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, 3, 9>
<3, 1, 9>
<4, 1, 6>
<6, 0, 4>
<8, 5, 9>
<9, 1, 3>
<9, 1, 8>
<9, 3, 6>
<9, 6, 8>
<9, 8, 5>
