Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 6) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the given nodes and edges:

Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Edges: (0, 5), (1, 3), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 4), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 9), (9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 8)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars in this graph:

Calculating for each node:
Node 0: Not considered as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 1: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 2: Not considered as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
Node 4: Not considered as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 7: Not considered as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 8: Not considered as it has less than 3 neighbors.
Node 9: Not considered as it has less than 3 neighbors.

Summing up the total number of 3-stars: 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [19].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:

<1, (2, 4, 5)>, <1, (4, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 5, 9)>, <1, (6, 5, 4)>, <3, (1, 2, 5)>, <6, (1, 2, 4)>, <6, (1, 4, 5)>, <6, (1, 4, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (7, 4, 8)>, <6, (8, 9, 4)>, <6, (8, 9, 1)>, <6, (8, 9, 5)>, <6, (9, 1, 5)>, <6, (9, 1, 4)>, <6, (9, 5, 4)>, <6, (9, 5, 1)>, <6, (9, 8, 1)>, <6, (9, 8, 4)>
