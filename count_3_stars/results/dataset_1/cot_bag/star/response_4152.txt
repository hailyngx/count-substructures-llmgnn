Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
First, let's find the nodes with three or more neighbors:

Node 0: 5 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors
Node 2: 5 neighbors
Node 3: 5 neighbors
Node 4: 4 neighbors
Node 5: 3 neighbors
Node 6: 4 neighbors
Node 7: 4 neighbors
Node 8: 6 neighbors
Node 9: 2 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For Node 0: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 3: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 7: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
For Node 8: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 62

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [62].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:

<0, (1, 7, 8)>
<0, (2, 3, 8)>
<0, (2, 5, 8)>
<0, (3, 5, 8)>
<0, (7, 6, 8)>
<2, (0, 3, 8)>
<2, (3, 5, 8)>
<2, (9, 3, 5)>
<3, (2, 5, 8)>
<3, (4, 6, 8)>
<3, (5, 6, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (3, 6, 8)>
<6, (4, 5, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 8)>
<7, (6, 8, 0)>
<8, (0, 2, 3)>
<8, (0, 2, 5)>
<8, (0, 7, 6)>
<8, (2, 3, 5)>
