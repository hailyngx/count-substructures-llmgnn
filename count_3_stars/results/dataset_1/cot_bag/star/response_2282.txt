Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes and their respective neighbors:

Node 0: 3, 4
Node 1: 4, 5, 9
Node 2: 5, 6, 8
Node 3: 0, 4, 6, 9
Node 4: 0, 1, 3, 7
Node 5: 1, 2, 7
Node 6: 2, 3, 7, 9
Node 7: 4, 5, 6
Node 8: 2, 9
Node 9: 1, 3, 6, 8

Now, let's identify the 3-stars:

Node 1 forms one 3-star with (4, 7, 9)
Node 2 does not form any 3-star
Node 3 forms two 3-stars: (0, 4, 6) and (4, 6, 9)
Node 4 forms one 3-star with (0, 3, 7)
Node 5 does not form any 3-star
Node 6 forms one 3-star with (3, 7, 9)
Node 7 does not form any 3-star
Node 8 does not form any 3-star
Node 9 does not form any 3-star

Counting the 3-stars, we have [1 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0] = [4].

The unique 3-stars are <1, (4, 7, 9)>, <3, (0, 4, 6)>, and <3, (4, 6, 9)>.
