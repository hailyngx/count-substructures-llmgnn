Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes are numbered from 0 to 9. Now, let's identify the 3-stars in this graph:

Node 2 forms a 3-star:
- <2, (5, 7, 9)>

There is one 3-star based on the above connections. So, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1].
