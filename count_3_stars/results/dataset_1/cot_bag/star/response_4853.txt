Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 8) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we first identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. Then, we calculate the number of 3-stars each of those nodes can form based on the number of neighbors. Here's the breakdown:

Node 0: 2 neighbors
Node 1: 3 neighbors <1, (2, 3, 7)>
Node 2: 2 neighbors
Node 3: 3 neighbors <3, (1, 7, 8)>
Node 4: 1 neighbor
Node 5: 2 neighbors
Node 6: 1 neighbor
Node 7: 4 neighbors <7, (0, 1, 3, 8)>
Node 8: 5 neighbors <8, (2, 3, 4, 5, 9)>
Node 9: 2 neighbors

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [2 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 5.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 7, 8)>
<7, (0, 1, 3, 8)>
<8, (2, 3, 4, 5, 9)>
