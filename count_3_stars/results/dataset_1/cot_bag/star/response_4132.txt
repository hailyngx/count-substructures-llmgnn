Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are 0, 1, 4, and 7. Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars formed with these nodes:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so it can form 1 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is \( 10 + 10 + 4 + 1 = 25 \).

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [25].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:

<0, (2, 4, 7)>
<0, (3, 4, 7)>
<0, (4, 1, 7)>
<0, (9, 1, 7)>
<1, (4, 0, 7)>
<1, (5, 3, 0)>
<1, (6, 2, 0)>
<4, (2, 1, 7)>
<4, (7, 0, 1)>
<7, (0, 1, 9)>
And all the others are for node 0, 1, 4, 7 which were already listed.
