Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 2) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph can be represented as follows, with their connections:
- Node 0: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 8
- Node 2: 3, 4, 9
- Node 3: 1, 2, 4, 5
- Node 4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Node 5: 0, 3, 6, 8
- Node 6: 0, 4, 5, 9
- Node 7: 0
- Node 8: 0, 1, 4, 5
- Node 9: 2, 6

Now, let's find the 3-stars in this graph by checking each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
    - <0, (1, 5, 6)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 5, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (1, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 7)>
    - <0, (5, 6, 8)>
    - <0, (5, 7, 8)>
    - <0, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <1, (0, 3, 4)>
    - <1, (0, 3, 8)>
    - <1, (0, 4, 8)>
    - <1, (3, 4, 8)>
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, forming [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
    - <4, (1, 2, 3)>
    - <4, (1, 2, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 3, 8)>
    - <4, (1, 6, 8)>
    - <4, (2, 3, 8)>
    - <4, (2, 4, 6)>
    - <4, (2, 4, 8)>
    - <4, (2, 6, 8)>
    - <4, (3, 6, 8)>
    - <4, (6, 8, 5)>
- Node 6 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <6, (0, 4, 5)>
    - <6, (0, 5, 9)>
    - <6, (4, 5, 8)>
    - <6, (4, 8, 5)>
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors, forming [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
    - <8, (0, 1, 4)>
    - <8, (0, 5, 4)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 6)>
    - <8, (4, 5, 0)>

Adding the total number of 3-stars formed by the nodes together, we get: [10 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 4] = [32]
