Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 1) (4, 6) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
This graph has the following nodes with their respective neighbors:  
- Node 0: Neighbors {1, 9}  
- Node 1: Neighbors {0, 3, 6, 8}  
- Node 3: Neighbors {1}  
- Node 4: Neighbors {6}  
- Node 5: Neighbors {7, 9}  
- Node 6: Neighbors {1, 4, 7}  
- Node 7: Neighbors {5, 6, 9}  
- Node 8: Neighbors {1, 9}  
- Node 9: Neighbors {0, 5, 7, 8}  

Now, let's determine the total number of 3-stars.  
For nodes with three or more neighbors, we have:  
- Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. Unique 3-stars for node 1: <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>  
- Node 5 forms no 3-star as it has only two neighbors.  
- Node 6 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. Unique 3-star for node 6: <6, (1, 4, 7)>  
- Node 7 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star. Unique 3-star for node 7: <7, (5, 6, 9)>  
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars. Unique 3-stars for node 9: <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>  

Total number of 3-stars: [4 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [10].  
Unique 3-stars found: <1, (0, 3, 6)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 3, 8)>, <6, (1, 4, 7)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>, <9, (0, 5, 7)>, <9, (0, 5, 8)>, <9, (0, 7, 8)>, <9, (5, 7, 8)>.
