Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (6, 0) (6, 2) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 3) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 4) 

Response:
Given the information provided, here is the breakdown of the 3-stars in the graph:

- Node 0 has 3 neighbors: 3, 5, and 6, forming 1 3-star. 
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 1, 6, 7, and 9, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, and 8, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 3, 8, and 9, forming 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors.

So, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is 3. 

Therefore, the answer is [3], and the unique 3-stars found are:

<0, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<3, (0, 4, 7)>
