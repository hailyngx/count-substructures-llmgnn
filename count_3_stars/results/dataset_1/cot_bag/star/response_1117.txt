Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are labeled from 0 to 9. Let's identify the 3-star structures in this graph:

For node 2: 
- 3 neighbors: 1, 8, 9
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <2, (1, 8, 9)>

For node 3:
- 3 neighbors: 5, 7, 9
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
- Unique 3-star: <3, (5, 7, 9)>

For node 6:
- 4 neighbors: 0, 4, 7, 8
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 7, 8)>, <6, (4, 7, 8)>, <6, (6, 4, 7)>

For node 7:
- 6 neighbors: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9
- Total number of 3-stars: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \)
- Unique 3-stars: <7, (1, 3, 4)>, <7, (1, 3, 5)>, <7, (1, 3, 6)>, <7, (1, 3, 9)>, <7, (1, 4, 5)>, <7, (1, 4, 6)>, <7, (1, 4, 9)>, <7, (1, 5, 6)>, <7, (1, 5, 9)>, <7, (1, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 5)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (3, 5, 6)>, <7, (3, 5, 9)>, <7, (3, 6, 9)>, <7, (4, 5, 6)>, <7, (4, 5, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, <7, (5, 6, 9)>

Putting it all together, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 20] = 26.
