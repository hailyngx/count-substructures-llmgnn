Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's visualize the graph:
```
    0 ---- 4 ---- 3 ---- 7
    |      |            |
    8      7            9
    |      |            |
    1      0 ---- 8 ---- 2 ---- 6
                        |
                        5
```

Now, we'll identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors to calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 0: 2 neighbors
- Node 1: 1 neighbor
- Node 2: 4 neighbors
- Node 3: 1 neighbor
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 1 neighbor
- Node 6: 1 neighbor
- Node 7: 2 neighbors
- Node 8: 5 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each relevant node:
Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
Node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
Node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [22].

The unique 3-stars are: 
<2, (8, 5, 9)>, 
<4, (0, 3, 7)>, 
<8, (0, 5, 9)>, 
<9, (2, 7, 8)>, 
<9, (7, 8, 2)>, 
<9, (8, 2, 7)>, 
<9, (2, 8, 7)>
