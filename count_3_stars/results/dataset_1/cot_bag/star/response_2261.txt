Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we will look at each node that has three or more neighbors. First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors:

- Node 0: 4 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 8: 6 neighbors
- Node 9: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \(\binom{4}{3} = 4\) 3-stars
- Node 1: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) 3-stars
- Node 8: \(\binom{6}{3} = 20\) 3-stars
- Node 9: 1 3-star
- Node 7: 1 3-star

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \(4 + 10 + 20 + 1 + 1 = 36\).  
So, the number of 3-stars is denoted as [36], and the unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <0, (1, 6, 9)>
- <1, (0, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 3, 5)>
