Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 4) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we look at nodes with three or more neighbors. Let's examine each node:

- Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 4, 5, 7, 8, 9. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 3 has 3 neighbors: 2, 5, 8. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 8. Hence, it can form 4 3-stars: <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>, <4, (1, 0, 8)>, <4, (2, 0, 8)>.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 7. Hence, it can form 1 3-star.

Counting the total number of 3-stars: 1 (from node 0) + 1 (from node 3) + 4 (from node 4) + 1 (from node 5) = 7.

Thus, the final answer is [7] and the unique 3-stars are <0, (4, 5, 7)>, <3, (2, 5, 8)>, <4, (0, 1, 8)>, <4, (0, 2, 8)>.
