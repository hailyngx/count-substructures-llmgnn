Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 6) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph, we need to identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors. 
Nodes with three or more neighbors:  
Node 0 has 3 neighbors  
Node 1 has 5 neighbors  
Node 2 has 4 neighbors  
Node 3 has 4 neighbors  
Node 6 has 7 neighbors  
Node 9 has 3 neighbors  

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0 can form 1 3-star
- Node 1 can form 10 choose 3 = 120 3-stars
- Node 2 can form 6 3-stars
- Node 3 can form 4 choose 3 = 4 3-stars
- Node 6 can form 35 3-stars
- Node 9 can form 1 3-star

Total number of 3-stars = 1 + 120 + 6 + 4 + 35 + 1 = 167

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [167], and the unique 3-stars are <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <1, (0, 6, 8)>, <1, (3, 6, 9)>, <1, (6, 7, 8)>, <1, (6, 8, 2)>, <1, (6, 9, 3)>, <2, (3, 6, 9)>, <2, (6, 7, 1)>, <2, (6, 9, 3)>, <3, (1, 6, 9)>, <6, (0, 1, 8)>, <6, (1, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 7, 1)>, <6, (2, 9, 3)>, <6, (3, 1, 9)>
