Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with more than 3 neighbors are: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:
For node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 5: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
For node 9: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Adding these up gives a total of \( 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 28 \) 3-stars.

Final Answer: [28]

Unique 3-stars: <2, (3, 4, 6)>, <3, (2, 8, 9)>, <4, (2, 5, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 7)>, <6, (1, 2, 9)>, <8, (0, 3, 4)>, <9, (1, 3, 6)>
