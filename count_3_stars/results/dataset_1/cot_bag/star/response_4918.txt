Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 1) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, let's first determine the degree of each node:

- Node 0 has degree 3
- Node 1 has degree 7
- Node 2 has degree 1
- Node 3 has degree 4
- Node 4 has degree 1
- Node 5 has degree 2
- Node 6 has degree 5
- Node 8 has degree 1
- Node 9 has degree 3

Now, we need to find the number of 3-stars for each node with a degree of 3 or more.

- Node 0: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star
- Node 1: [inom{7}{3}] = 35 3-stars
- Node 3: [inom{4}{3}] = 4 3-stars
- Node 6: [inom{5}{3}] = 10 3-stars
- Node 9: [inom{3}{3}] = 1 3-star

Adding these up: 1 + 35 + 4 + 10 + 1 = 51 3-stars 

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [51]. 

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 3, 4)>
<1, (0, 3, 5)>
<1, (0, 3, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 5, 6)>
<1, (3, 6, 9)>
<3, (1, 6, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 9)>
