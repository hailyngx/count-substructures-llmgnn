Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (9, 3) 

Response:
There are several nodes with three or more neighbors in this graph, as listed below:
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: 4, 5, 6, 8
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 7, 9
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 5
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7
- Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 5
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 3, 5
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 2
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor: 3

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
- For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- For Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Summing these up: 10 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 10 = 32 3-stars.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [32]

The unique 3-stars found are:
<1, (3, 4, 5)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 5, 7)>
<2, (4, 5, 6)>
<2, (4, 5, 8)>
<2, (4, 6, 8)>
<2, (5, 6, 8)>
<3, (1, 4, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 5)>
<5, (0, 2, 6)>
<5, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (2, 6, 7)>
