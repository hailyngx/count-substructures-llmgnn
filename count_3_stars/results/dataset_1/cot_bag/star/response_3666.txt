Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 7) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph with the provided nodes and edges:

Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9

Edges:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 1
- Node 1 is connected to Nodes 0, 3, 4, and 7
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 4 and 7
- Node 3 is connected to Nodes 1 and 9
- Node 4 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 6, 8, and 9
- Node 6 is connected to Nodes 4 and 9
- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 1, 2, 8, and 9
- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 4 and 7
- Node 9 is connected to Nodes 3, 4, 6, and 7

Next, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 5 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 7 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
- Node 9 has 4 neighbors, so it can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.

Total number of 3-stars = 4 + 10 + 4 + 4 = 22

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 4, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 7)>
<1, (4, 8, 7)>
<1, (4, 9, 7)>
<4, (1, 2, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 8)>
<4, (1, 7, 9)>
<4, (2, 6, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 8)>
<4, (2, 7, 9)>
<4, (6, 8, 9)>
<4, (7, 8, 9)>
<7, (1, 2, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 8)>
<7, (1, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 4, 8)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (4, 8, 9)>
<9, (1, 4, 6)>
<9, (1, 4, 7)>
<9, (4, 6, 7)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [22].
