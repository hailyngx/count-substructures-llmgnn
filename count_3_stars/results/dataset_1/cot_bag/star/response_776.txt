Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 34 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (1, 2) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 34 edges, we need to identify the nodes that have at least three neighbors.

Here are the nodes with their neighbors:
- Node 0: 4, 6, 9
- Node 2: 1, 6, 7, 8
- Node 3: 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 6, 7, 8
- Node 5: 3, 8, 9
- Node 6: 0, 2, 4, 7
- Node 7: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9
- Node 8: 2, 3, 4, 5
- Node 9: 0, 5, 7

We see that nodes 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 have at least three neighbors, so we will calculate the number of 3-stars involving these nodes.

For Node 0: 
Since Node 0 has 3 neighbors (4, 6, 9), the number of 3-stars involving Node 0 is \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \). Thus, we have <0, (4, 6, 9)>.

For Node 2: 
Since Node 2 has 4 neighbors (1, 6, 7, 8), the number of 3-stars involving Node 2 is  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Thus, we have <2, (1, 6, 7)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (7, 6, 8)>, and <2, (1, 7, 8)>.

For Node 4: 
Since Node 4 has 4 neighbors (0, 6, 7, 8), the number of 3-stars involving Node 4 is  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Thus, we have <4, (0, 6, 7)>, <4, (0, 6, 8)>, <4, (7, 6, 8)>, and <4, (0, 7, 8)>.

For Node 6:
Since Node 6 has 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 7), the number of 3-stars involving Node 6 is  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Thus, we have <6, (0, 2, 4)>, <6, (0, 2, 7)>, <6, (4, 2, 7)>, and <6, (0, 4, 7)>.

For Node 7:
Since Node 7 has 5 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 6, 9), the number of 3-stars involving Node 7 is  \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \). Thus, we have <7, (2, 3, 4)>, <7, (2, 3, 6)>, <7, (2, 3, 9)>, <7, (2, 4, 6)>, <7, (2, 4, 9)>, <7, (2, 6, 9)>, <7, (3, 4, 6)>, <7, (3, 4, 9)>, <7, (4, 6, 9)>, and <7, (2, 6, 4)>.

For Node 8:
Since Node 8 has 4 neighbors (2, 3, 4, 5), the number of 3-stars involving Node 8 is  \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \). Thus, we have <8, (2, 3, 4)>, <8, (2, 3, 5)>, <8, (4, 3, 5)>, and <8, (2, 4, 5)>.

By summing up all the 3-stars found, we have a total of [29] unique 3-stars in the graph.
