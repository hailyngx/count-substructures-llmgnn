Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (8, 4) (9, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has neighbors 5, 7
- Node 2 has neighbors 1, 5, 6
- Node 3 has neighbors 5, 6
- Node 4 has neighbors 5, 8, 9
- Node 5 has neighbors 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
- Node 6 has neighbors 2, 3, 5

Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (< 2, 5, 6>)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (Less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<5, 8, 9>)
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) (<0, 1, 2>, <0, 1, 5>, <0, 2, 5>, <1, 2, 5>, <3, 5, 4>, <4, 5, 8>, <4, 5, 9>, <5, 0, 2>, <5, 1, 2>, <5, 1, 6>, <5, 2, 6>, <5, 3, 4>, <5, 4, 9>, <5, 6, 2>, <6, 2, 5>, <6, 3, 5>, <8, 4, 5>, <9, 4, 5>, <4, 5, 3>, <5, 4, 6>)
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) (<2, 3, 5>)

The total number of 3-stars in this graph is calculated by summing up the values: 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 20 + 1 = 23.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [23].
