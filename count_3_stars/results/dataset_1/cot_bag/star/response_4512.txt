Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in the given graph, we will check each node to see if it forms a 3-star.

Node 0 has 5 neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7
Node 0 forms inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars: 
<0, (1, 2, 3)>, <0, (1, 2, 6)>, <0, (1, 2, 7)>, <0, (1, 3, 6)>, <0, (1, 3, 7)>, <0, (1, 6, 7)>, <0, (2, 3, 6)>, <0, (2, 3, 7)>, <0, (2, 6, 7)>, <0, (3, 6, 7)> 

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 0, 2, 4, 8
Node 1 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars: 
<1, (0, 2, 4)>, <1, (0, 2, 8)>, <1, (0, 4, 8)>, <1, (2, 4, 8)> 

Node 2 has 6 neighbors: 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8
Node 2 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars:
<2, (0, 1, 3)>, <2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 6)>, <2, (0, 1, 8)>, <2, (0, 3, 5)>, <2, (0, 3, 6)>, <2, (0, 3, 8)>, <2, (0, 5, 6)>, <2, (0, 5, 8)>, <2, (0, 6, 8)>, <2, (1, 3, 5)>, <2, (1, 3, 6)>, <2, (1, 3, 8)>, <2, (1, 5, 6)>, <2, (1, 5, 8)>, <2, (1, 6, 8)>, <2, (3, 5, 6)>, <2, (3, 5, 8)>, <2, (3, 6, 8)>, <2, (5, 6, 8)>

Node 3 has 2 neighbors: 0, 9
Node 3 doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 4 has 2 neighbors: 1, 5
Node 4 doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 5 has 2 neighbors: 2, 4
Node 5 doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 2, 7
Node 6 forms 1 3-star: 
<6, (0, 2, 7)>

Node 7 has 2 neighbors: 0, 6
Node 7 doesn't form any 3-star.

Node 8 has 3 neighbors: 1, 2, 9
Node 8 forms 1 3-star: 
<8, (1, 2, 9)>

Node 9 has 2 neighbors: 3, 8
Node 9 doesn't form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars in the graph is [10 + 4 + 20 + 1 + 1] = 36.

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 3)>,
<0, (1, 2, 6)>,
<0, (1, 2, 7)>,
<0, (1, 3, 6)>,
<0, (1, 3, 7)>,
<0, (1, 6, 7)>,
<0, (2, 3, 6)>,
<0, (2, 3, 7)>,
<0, (2, 6, 7)>,
<0, (3, 6, 7)>,
<1, (0, 2, 4)>,
<1, (0, 2, 8)>,
<1, (0, 4, 8)>,
<1, (2, 4, 8)>,
<2, (0, 1, 3)>,
<2, (0, 1, 5)>,
