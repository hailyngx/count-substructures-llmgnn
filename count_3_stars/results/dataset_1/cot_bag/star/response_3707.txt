Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are three nodes with three or more neighbors: node 0, node 1, and node 2. We will calculate the number of 3-stars that can be formed with each of these nodes.

1. Node 0:
    - Node 0 has 3 neighbors: nodes 2, 7, and 8.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <0, (2, 7, 8)>

2. Node 1:
    - Node 1 has 3 neighbors: nodes 2, 6, and 8.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <1, (2, 6, 8)>

3. Node 2:
    - Node 2 has 3 neighbors: nodes 0, 1, and 9.
    - Number of 3-stars with node 2: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
    - <2, (0, 1, 9)>

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the graph is [3], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are <0, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (2, 6, 8)>, and <2, (0, 1, 9)>.
