Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 22 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 0) (9, 0) (9, 3) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to analyze each node.

- Node 0 has 2 neighbors (7, 9)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors (2, 4, 5)
- Node 2 has 3 neighbors (1, 5, 6)
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors (4, 9)
- Node 4 has 4 neighbors (1, 3, 5, 6)
- Node 5 has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6)
- Node 6 has 2 neighbors (2, 4)
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor (0)
- Node 9 has 2 neighbors (0, 3)

Calculating the total number of 3-stars:

- Node 0 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 1 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- Node 2 forms \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star. <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 3 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 4 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>, <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- Node 5 forms \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars. <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>, <5, (1, 2, 4)>
- Node 6 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 7 does not form any 3-star.
- Node 9 does not form any 3-star.

The total number of 3-stars is 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 10, so the final answer is [10].

Unique 3-stars: 
- <1, (2, 4, 5)>
- <2, (1, 5, 6)>
- <4, (1, 5, 6)>
- <5, (1, 2, 4)>
