Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 6) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (9, 7) 

Response:
There are 3 nodes with 3 or more neighbors: nodes 0, 2, and 7. Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 4, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 2:
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors: nodes 0, 6, 7, and 8.
- Number of 3-stars = inom{4}{3} = 4

For node 7:
- Node 7 has 5 neighbors: nodes 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9.
- Number of 3-stars = inom{5}{3} = 10

Total number of 3-stars: 4 + 4 + 10 = 18

Thus, the final answer is [18].

And the unique 3-stars found are: 
<0, (2, 4, 8)>,  
<2, (0, 6, 8)>,  
<7, (2, 6, 9)>,  
<7, (2, 5, 6)>,  
<7, (3, 5, 9)>,  
<7, (3, 6, 9)>,  
<7, (5, 6, 9)>.
