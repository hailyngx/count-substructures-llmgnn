Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 16 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 5) (1, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 9) (5, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) 

Response:
The graph can be visualized as follows:

```
1 -- 5       8 -- 9 -- 3
 \             /
  8 -- 2 -- 6
 /       /
5 -- 1  2 -- 7
```

Let's go through each node to determine the 3-stars:

- Node 1: It has 2 neighbors (5, 8) <1, (5, 8)>
- Node 2: It has 3 neighbors (6, 7, 8) <2, (6, 7, 8)>
- Node 3: It has 1 neighbor (9), so no 3-star formed
- Node 5: It has 1 neighbor (1), so no 3-star formed
- Node 6: It has 2 neighbors (2, 8) <6, (2, 8)>
- Node 7: It has 1 neighbor (2), so no 3-star formed
- Node 8: It has 4 neighbors (1, 2, 6, 9) <8, (1, 2, 6)> and <8, (1, 9, 2)>
- Node 9: It has 2 neighbors (3, 8) <9, (3, 8)>

So, the unique 3-stars formed are: <1, (5, 8)>, <2, (6, 7, 8)>, <6, (2, 8)>, <8, (1, 2, 6)>, <8, (1, 9, 2)>, and <9, (3, 8)>.

Counting these unique 3-stars, we find a total of [5].
