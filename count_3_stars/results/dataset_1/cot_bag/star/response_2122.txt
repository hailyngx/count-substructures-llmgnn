Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we'll look at each node that has three or more neighbors:

- Node 2 has 5 neighbors (0, 1, 5, 7, 9). So, it can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
- Node 4 has 3 neighbors (3, 6, 8). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 5 has 3 neighbors (2, 6, 8). So, it can form 1 3-star.
- Node 7 has 3 neighbors (1, 2, 3). So, it can form 1 3-star.

Adding up these individual counts, we have a total of \(10 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13\) 3-stars in the graph.

So, the final answer is [13], and the unique 3-stars found in the graph are: 
<2, (0, 1, 5)>, <2, (0, 1, 7)>, <2, (0, 1, 9)>, <2, (0, 5, 7)>, <2, (0, 5, 9)>, <2, (0, 7, 9)>, <2, (1, 5, 7)>, <2, (1, 5, 9)>, <2, (1, 7, 9)>, <2, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (3, 6, 8)>, <5, (2, 6, 8)>, <7, (1, 2, 3)>.
