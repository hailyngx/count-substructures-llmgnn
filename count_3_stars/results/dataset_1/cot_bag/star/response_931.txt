Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 28 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 1) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 3) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 0) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes in this graph are: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

Now, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 1 has 5 neighbors
- Node 2 has 4 neighbors
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors

Now, we'll calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is 4 + 10 + 4 + 10 = 28. So, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (1, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 2, 7)>
<2, (0, 1, 5)>
<5, (0, 1, 7)>
