Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 14 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 7) (5, 9) (6, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with their neighbors are:
- Node 0: 3, 4
- Node 1: 6
- Node 3: 0, 9
- Node 4: 0, 7
- Node 5: 9
- Node 6: 1
- Node 7: 4, 8
- Node 8: 7
- Node 9: 3, 5

Let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each node with three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 1: \( \binom{1}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 3: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 7: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) (less than 3 neighbors)

Therefore, there are no 3-stars in this graph, so the total number of 3-stars is [0] and the unique 3-stars found inside <> is <>
