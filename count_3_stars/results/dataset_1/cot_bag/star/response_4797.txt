Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 5) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 3) (7, 5) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) 

Response:
First, let's list the neighbors of each node based on the given edges:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1 and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to node 0.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 5 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 5 and 6.
- Node 4 is connected to node 5.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to node 3.
- Node 7 is connected to node 5.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 2 and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to node 0.

Now, we can identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 1 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 3 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 5 has 5 neighbors.
- Node 6 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 7 has 1 neighbor.
- Node 8 has 2 neighbors.
- Node 9 has 1 neighbor.

Therefore, we only need to consider the 3-star formations involving node 5 since it is the only node with three or more neighbors. Node 5 can form inom{5}{3} = 10 3-stars.

The total number of 3-stars is [10].

The unique 3-stars are:
<5, (2, 3, 4)>
<5, (2, 3, 7)>
<5, (2, 4, 7)>
<5, (3, 4, 7)>
<5, (2, 7, 8)>
<5, (3, 4, 8)>
<5, (3, 7, 8)>
<5, (4, 7, 8)>
<5, (2, 3, 8)>
<5, (2, 4, 8)>
