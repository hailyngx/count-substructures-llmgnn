Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
First let's represent the given graph:

- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 0, 5, and 9.
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 7 and 8.
- Node 3 is connected to nodes 0 and 4.
- Node 4 is connected to nodes 0, 3, and 6.
- Node 5 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8.
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 0, 4, and 7.
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 6.
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 2, and 5.
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.

Now we'll find the 3-stars:
- Node 0 forms inom{6}{3} = 20 3-stars: 
    - <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)> (4 unique)
- Node 1 has 3 neighbors, so it doesn't form any 3-stars.
- Node 4 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star: 
    - <4, (0, 3, 6)>  
- Node 5 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star:
    - <5, (1, 7, 8)>   
- Node 7 forms inom{3}{3} = 1 3-star:
    - <7, (2, 5, 6)>   

Thus, the total number of 3-stars is [20 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [23].
The unique 3-stars found are <0, (1, 4, 6)>, <0, (1, 4, 8)>, <0, (1, 6, 8)>, <0, (4, 6, 8)>, <4, (0, 3, 6)>, <5, (1, 7, 8)>, <7, (2, 5, 6)>.
