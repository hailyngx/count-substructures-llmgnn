Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 42 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors:
- Node 0: 1, 3, 4, 7
- Node 1: 0, 3, 4, 5, 7
- Node 2: 7, 8, 9
- Node 3: 0, 1, 5, 7, 8
- Node 4: 0, 1, 7
- Node 5: 1, 3, 7, 8, 9
- Node 6: 8, 9
- Node 7: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8
- Node 8: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Node 9: 2, 5, 6

Following the method described earlier, we find that only nodes 0, 1, and 7 have three or more neighbors and thus have the potential to form 3-stars.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars

Adding these together, we have a total of \( [4 + 10 + 35] = 49 \) 3-stars in this graph.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (1, 3, 4)>
- <0, (1, 3, 7)>
- <0, (1, 4, 7)>
- <0, (3, 4, 7)>
- <1, (3, 5, 7)>
- <1, (3, 7, 8)>
- <1, (4, 5, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7, 8)>
- <7, (2, 3, 8)>
- <7, (3, 4, 5)>
- <7, (3, 5, 8)>
- <7, (4, 5, 8)>
- <7, (5, 8, 9)>
