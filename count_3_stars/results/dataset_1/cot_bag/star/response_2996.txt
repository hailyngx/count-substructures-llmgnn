Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 18 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 4) (8, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes having three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9.

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 7: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{2}{3} = 0 \) 3-stars

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is \( [1 + 20] = 21 \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<0, (7, 8, 1)>
<6, (4, 5, 9)>
<7, (0, 1, 2)>
<7, (1, 0, 2)>
