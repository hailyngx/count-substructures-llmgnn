Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
To determine the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we first need to identify which nodes have three or more neighbors.

Node 1 has 4 neighbors: 2, 3, 7, 8
Node 2 has 2 neighbors: 1, 9
Node 3 has 4 neighbors: 1, 4, 6, 9
Node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3, 5, 7, 8, 9
Node 5 has 3 neighbors: 4, 6
Node 6 has 3 neighbors: 0, 3, 5
Node 7 has 3 neighbors: 1, 4, 9
Node 8 has 2 neighbors: 1, 4
Node 9 has 5 neighbors: 2, 3, 4, 7

Now we calculate the number of 3-stars for each eligible node:
Node 1 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 3 can form \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars.
Node 4 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.
Node 9 can form \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars.

Adding these together, we have a total of \( 4 + 4 + 10 + 10 = 28 \) 3-stars in this graph.

So, the final answer is [28].

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
<1, (2, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 7, 8)>, <1, (3, 4, 7)>, <1, (4, 7, 8)>, <3, (1, 4, 6)>, <3, (1, 4, 9)>, <3, (4, 6, 9)>, <4, (3, 5, 7)>, <4, (3, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 8)>, <4, (5, 7, 9)>, <4, (5, 8, 9)>, <9, (3, 7, 4)>, <9, (3, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 8)>, <9, (4, 7, 9)>, <9, (4, 8, 7)>.
