Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
The nodes with their respective neighbors are:
   - Node 0: 5
   - Node 1: 7, 9
   - Node 2: 3, 6, 7
   - Node 3: 2, 5, 9
   - Node 4: 6
   - Node 5: 0, 3, 7, 9
   - Node 6: 2, 4, 9
   - Node 7: 1, 2, 5
   - Node 9: 1, 3, 5, 6

The nodes that have at least three neighbors are:
- Node 2 (neighbors: 3, 6, 7)
- Node 3 (neighbors: 2, 5, 9)
- Node 5 (neighbors: 0, 3, 7, 9)
- Node 6 (neighbors: 2, 4, 9)
- Node 7 (neighbors: 1, 2, 5)
- Node 9 (neighbors: 1, 3, 5, 6)

Calculating the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 2: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 3: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 5: inom{4}{3} = 4
- Node 6: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 7: inom{3}{3} = 1
- Node 9: inom{4}{3} = 4

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4] = 12.

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are:
- <2, (3, 6, 7)>
- <3, (2, 5, 9)>
- <5, (0, 7, 9)>
- <6, (2, 4, 9)>
- <7, (1, 2, 5)>
- <9, (1, 3, 5)>
- <9, (3, 5, 6)>
