Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (3, 9) (4, 9) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) 

Response:
To find the 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 24 edges, we will first visualize the graph and then identify the 3-stars in it.

The graph can be represented as follows:
- Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 8, and 9
- Node 1 is connected to nodes 6, 7, and 8
- Node 2 is connected to nodes 0 and 9
- Node 3 is connected to node 9
- Node 4 is connected to node 9
- Node 5 is connected to node 6
- Node 6 is connected to nodes 1 and 5
- Node 7 is connected to nodes 1 and 8
- Node 8 is connected to nodes 0, 1, 7, and 9
- Node 9 is connected to nodes 0, 2, 3, 4, 8

Now, let's calculate the 3-stars in this graph:
- Node 0 forms 1 3-star
- Node 1 forms 1 3-star
- Node 2 forms 1 3-star
- Node 8 forms 1 3-star
- Node 9 forms inom{4}{3} = 4 3-stars

Adding these together gives us a total of [1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4] = [8] 3-stars.

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 8, 9)>
- <1, (6, 7, 8)>
- <2, (0, 8, 9)>
- <8, (0, 1, 9)>
- <9, (0, 2, 8)>
- <9, (0, 3, 4)>
- <9, (2, 3, 4)>
- <9, (8, 3, 4)>
