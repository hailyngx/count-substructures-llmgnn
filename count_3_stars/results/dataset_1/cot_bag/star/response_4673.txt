Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) 

Response:
The nodes in the graph are: {0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The degrees of the nodes are: 
- Node 0: degree 4
- Node 2: degree 3
- Node 3: degree 4
- Node 4: degree 3
- Node 5: degree 3
- Node 6: degree 2
- Node 7: degree 2
- Node 8: degree 3
- Node 9: degree 2

We will calculate the number of 3-stars for nodes with degree 3 or more.

For node 0:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 2:
- Total neighbors: 3
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 3:
- Total neighbors: 4
- Number of 3-stars: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

For node 4:
- Total neighbors: 3
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 5:
- Total neighbors: 3
- Number of 3-stars: 1

For node 8:
- Total neighbors: 3
- Number of 3-stars: 1

Adding all the 3-stars together: 
\[ [4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [12]  \]

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, 2, 3, 4>
- <0, 2, 3, 5>
- <0, 2, 3, 8>
- <0, 3, 4, 9>
