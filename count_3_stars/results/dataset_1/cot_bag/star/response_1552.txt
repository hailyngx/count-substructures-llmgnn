Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 3) 

Response:
The nodes with 3 or more neighbors are nodes 0, 1, 4, 6, and 7. 
Now, let's calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For node 0, there are \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 1, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star.
For node 4, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 6, there are \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) possible 3-stars.
For node 7, there are \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) possible 3-star.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is \( [10 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1] = [20] \).

The unique 3-stars found in this graph are: 
<0, (1, 8, 7)>, 
<0, (4, 3, 8)>, 
<0, (5, 6, 1)>, 
<0, (7, 1, 8)>, 
<0, (8, 1, 4)>, 
<0, (8, 3, 4)>, 
<4, (0, 7, 6)>, 
<4, (2, 3, 6)>, 
<6, (1, 5, 0)>, 
<6, (2, 3, 4)>, 
<7, (0, 1, 8)>.
