Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 24 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 6) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 7) (4, 1) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) 

Response:
The given graph can be visually represented as follows:

```
      0
      |
      6
     / \
    3   8
   /|   |\
  1 2   7 9
   |
   4
   |
   5
```

To calculate the total number of 3-stars:
- Node 1 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 2 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 4 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 5 has 1 neighbor, so no 3-star is formed.
- Node 7 has 2 neighbors, so no 3-star is formed.
- Nodes 0, 6, and 9 have 3 neighbors each, so each forms 1 3-star.
- Nodes 3 and 8 have 4 neighbors each, so each forms 4 3-stars.

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: 
1 3-star from node 0 + 1 3-star from node 6 + 1 3-star from node 9 = 3
4 3-stars from node 3 + 4 3-stars from node 8 = 8

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [3 + 8] = [11].

The unique 3-stars found in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 6, 8>
- <6, 0, 3, 8>
- <9, 5, 8, 6>
- <3, 1, 2, 6>
- <3, 1, 4, 6>
- <3, 2, 1, 6>
- <3, 2, 7, 8>
- <3, 4, 1, 6>
- <3, 8, 5, 6>
- <3, 8, 7, 6>
- <3, 8, 9, 6>
