Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 46 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's determine which nodes have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0: 3 neighbors
- Node 1: 5 neighbors
- Node 2: 5 neighbors
- Node 3: 4 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 5 neighbors
- Node 6: 4 neighbors
- Node 7: 3 neighbors
- Node 8: 7 neighbors
- Node 9: 6 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 2: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \) 3-stars
- Node 6: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \) 3-stars
- Node 7: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 8: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars

Summing up all the 3-stars from the nodes with three or more neighbors:
\[ [1 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 + 1 + 35 + 20] = 99 \]

Therefore, there are 99 3-stars in this graph. 

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
- <0, (1, 4, 8)>
- <1, (0, 2, 5)>
- <1, (2, 5, 8)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <1, (2, 8, 9)>
- <2, (1, 3, 8)>
- <2, (3, 7, 8)>
- <2, (3, 8, 9)>
- <3, (2, 4, 8)>
- <3, (4, 8, 9)>
- <4, (0, 3, 9)>
- <5, (1, 4, 8)>
- <5, (4, 6, 8)>
- <5, (6, 8, 9)>
- <5, (1, 8, 9)>
- <6, (5, 7, 9)>
- <7, (2, 6, 8)>
- <8, (0, 1, 5)>
- <8, (1, 2, 9)>
- <8, (3, 5, 6)>
- <8, (5, 6, 9)>
- <8, (6, 7, 9)>
- <9, (1, 5, 8)>
