Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
The nodes with the number of neighbors are as follows:
- Node 0: 1 neighbor
- Node 1: 8 neighbors
- Node 2: 6 neighbors
- Node 3: 3 neighbors
- Node 4: 4 neighbors
- Node 5: 4 neighbors
- Node 6: 3 neighbors
- Node 7: 6 neighbors
- Node 8: 2 neighbors
- Node 9: 4 neighbors

Let's calculate the total number of 3-stars:

For node 1:
\[ \binom{8}{3} = 56 \]

For node 2:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

For node 4:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 5:
\[ \binom{4}{3} = 4 \]

For node 7:
\[ \binom{6}{3} = 20 \]

Summing up these, we get:
\[ 56 + 20 + 4 + 4 + 20 = 104 \]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [104].

The unique 3-stars are:
<1, (0, 2, 9)>
<1, (2, 4, 7)>
<1, (3, 5, 7)>
<1, (4, 6, 9)>
<1, (6, 7, 8)>
<2, (1, 4, 7)>
<2, (1, 6, 9)>
<2, (3, 5, 6)>
<2, (7, 8, 9)>
<4, (1, 2, 7)>
<5, (1, 3, 7)>
<7, (1, 2, 4)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<7, (2, 4, 9)>
<7, (2, 6, 8)>
