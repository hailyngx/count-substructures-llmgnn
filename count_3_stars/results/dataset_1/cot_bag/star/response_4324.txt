Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 36 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 9) (1, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 9) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) 

Response:
First, let's construct the graph based on the given nodes and edges:

```
Graph:
0 -- 1 -- 3 -- 6
|         |    |
7         5 -- 7
|       / |    |
9 -- 2   4    8
```

To find the total number of 3-stars, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors and calculate the number of 3-stars it participates in:

Node 0: 3 neighbors (1, 3, 7) => [1]
Node 1: 3 neighbors (0, 3, 5) => [1]
Node 3: 3 neighbors (0, 1, 6) => [1]
Node 5: 5 neighbors (1, 4, 6, 7, 8) => [10]
Node 4: 4 neighbors (2, 5, 8, 9) => [4]
Node 6: 4 neighbors (3, 5, 7, 9) => [4]
Node 9: 4 neighbors (0, 2, 4, 6) => [4]

Calculating the total number of 3-stars: [1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 4 + 4 + 4] = [25]

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in the given graph is [25].

Unique 3-stars:
<0, 1, 3>
<5, 1, 3>
<5, 1, 6>
<5, 3, 6>
<5, 0, 9>
<5, 1, 9>
<5, 3, 9>
<5, 4, 9>
<5, 6, 9>
<4, 2, 9>
<6, 3, 9>
<4, 8, 5>
<4, 9, 6>
<7, 0, 9>
<7, 5, 6>
<9, 0, 2>
<9, 2, 4>
<5, 8, 4>
<9, 6, 7>
<7, 6, 3>
