Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (2, 1) (2, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 2) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph, we need to examine each node that has three or more neighbors.

Node 0 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 0 as the center.
Node 1 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 1 as the center.
Node 3 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 3 as the center.
Node 5 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 5 as the center.
Node 6 has 4 neighbors, so there are 4 3-stars with node 6 as the center.
Node 7 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 7 as the center.
Node 8 has 3 neighbors, so there is 1 3-star with node 8 as the center.

Adding these up, we have a total of 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 13 3-stars in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars is [13].

The unique 3-stars are:
<0, (5, 6, 8)>
<1, (2, 3, 7)>
<3, (1, 6, 7)>
<5, (0, 7, 8)>
<6, (0, 1, 3)>
<7, (1, 3, 5)>
<8, (0, 5, 6)>
