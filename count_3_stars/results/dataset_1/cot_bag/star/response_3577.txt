Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 26 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (2, 0) (2, 6) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (5, 0) (5, 4) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (7, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes with three or more neighbors: 
Node 0 has 4 neighbors
Node 3 has 3 neighbors
Node 4 has 4 neighbors
Node 8 has 5 neighbors

Now, we calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \)
For node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Summing up, we get a total of 4 + 1 + 4 + 10 = 19 3-stars in this graph.

Putting this number inside brackets gives us: [19]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<0, (2, 3, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 5)>
<0, (4, 1, 5)>
<0, (3, 4, 8)>
<3, (0, 6, 8)>
<4, (0, 1, 5)>
<4, (0, 8, 5)>
<4, (1, 5, 8)>
<4, (1, 8, 6)>
<8, (3, 4, 6)>
<8, (4, 6, 7)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
<8, (3, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 6, 9)>
<8, (4, 7, 9)>
<8, (6, 7, 9)>
