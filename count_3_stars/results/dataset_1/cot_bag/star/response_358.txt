Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (5, 0) (5, 6) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (9, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) 

Response:
First, let's identify the nodes that have three or more neighbors:
- Node 0 has 4 neighbors
- Node 3 has 4 neighbors
- Node 6 has 5 neighbors
- Node 8 has 4 neighbors

Now, let's calculate the total number of 3-stars: 
For node 0: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 3: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For node 8: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)

Adding these up: 4 + 4 + 10 + 4 = 22

So, there are 22 3-stars in this graph.
Putting this inside brackets: [22]

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars:
<0, (3, 5, 8)>, <3, (0, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 3, 9)>, <6, (4, 5, 9)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (3, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 9)>, <6, (0, 5, 8)>, <6, (3, 4, 5)>, <6, (4, 7, 9)>
<0, (3, 8, 9)>, <6, (0, 4, 7)>, <6, (0, 5, 9)>, <6, (3, 5, 8)>, <6, (7, 8, 9)>
<0, (5, 6, 8)>, <6, (0, 4, 5)>, <6, (3, 4, 8)>, <6, (3, 7, 9)>, <6, (5, 8, 9)>
<3, (0, 6, 7)>, <6, (3, 5, 9)>, <6, (4, 6, 9)>

These are the unique 3-stars found in the graph.
