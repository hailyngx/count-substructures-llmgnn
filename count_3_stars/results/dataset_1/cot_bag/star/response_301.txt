Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 32 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 5) 

Response:
The nodes with three or more neighbors are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9.

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

- Node 0: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 1: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 2: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 3: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star
- Node 5: \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \) 3-stars
- Node 9: \( \binom{3}{3} = 1 \) 3-star

Adding these up, we get a total of 43 3-stars in this graph: [43].

The unique 3-stars are:
- <0, (2, 3, 5)>
- <1, (5, 8, 9)>
- <2, (0, 3, 5)>
- <2, (5, 6, 9)>
- <3, (0, 2, 5)>
- <5, (0, 1, 2)>
- <5, (2, 3, 4)>
- <5, (1, 9, 2)>
- <5, (4, 6, 9)>
- <5, (9, 1, 2)>
- <9, (1, 5, 2)>
