Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 30 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 5) 

Response:
To find the total number of 3-stars in this graph with 10 nodes and 30 edges, we will first identify the nodes with three or more neighbors.

Node 1 has neighbors: 0, 2, 5, 6, and 9 (5 neighbors)
Node 2 has neighbors: 1, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)
Node 3 has neighbors: 4, 5, 6 (3 neighbors)
Node 4 has neighbors: 3, 5, 6, 9 (4 neighbors)
Node 5 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 (5 neighbors)
Node 6 has neighbors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 (5 neighbors)
Node 9 has neighbors: 1, 4, 5 (3 neighbors)

Now, we will calculate the number of 3-stars for each of these nodes:

For Node 1: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 4: \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
For Node 5: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)
For Node 6: \( \binom{5}{3} = 10 \)

Total number of 3-stars = 10 (from Node 1) + 4 (from Node 4) + 10 (from Node 5) + 10 (from Node 6) = 34

Therefore, the total number of 3-stars in this graph is [34].

Now, let's list the unique 3-stars found:
<1, (0, 2, 5)>
<1, (0, 5, 6)>
<1, (0, 5, 9)>
<1, (2, 5, 6)>
<1, (2, 5, 9)>
<1, (5, 6, 9)>
<4, (3, 5, 9)>
<5, (1, 2, 3)>
<5, (1, 2, 4)>
<5, (1, 2, 9)>
<5, (1, 3, 4)>
<5, (1, 3, 9)>
<5, (1, 4, 9)>
<6, (1, 3, 4)>
<6, (1, 3, 5)>
<6, (1, 4, 5)>
<6, (1, 5, 9)>
